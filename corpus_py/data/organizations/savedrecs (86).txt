J	James, KC; Bhasi, M				James, K. C.; Bhasi, M.			Development of model categories for performance improvement studies related to airport terminal operations	JOURNAL OF SIMULATION			English	Article						conceptual modelling; model classification; airport terminals	SIMULATION	Simulation modelling has been widely used for the design and performance improvement of logistic terminal systems. One of the issues related to the performance improvement studies of airport terminal systems is the need for developing and using many different models of the same terminal system for solving its problems. A possible approach to address this difficulty is some form of problem clustering and model clustering, that is for the solution of problems from a problem category using corresponding models from the model category. In this paper, we discuss the conceptual modelling and development of three types of model categories called Fixed Facility Focus models, Variable Facility Focus models and Transient Entity Focus models and explain their use to solve problems of strategic nature related to fixed facilities, tactical problems related to the variable facilities, and operational problems related to transient entities and their schedules.

J	Malos, S				Malos, Stan			Regulatory Effects and Strategic Global Staffing Profiles: Beyond Cost Concerns in Evaluating Offshore Location Attractiveness m	EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES AND RIGHTS JOURNAL			English	Article						offshoring; outsourcing; global staffing; strategic HRM; multinational corporations		The practice of offshoring-staffing all or part of a business outside the home country has proliferated to such an extent that the question for most multinational corporations (MNCs) is where, not if, some or all of its labor forces should be located beyond geopolitical borders. It remains an open question, however, where and under what conditions the hoped-for advantages of offshore staffing are best realized. While cost savings continue to play the major role for most companies, both quality and availability of worker skills and administrative and regulatory contexts of labor markets have increasingly influenced global staffing decision processes. This paper has two purposes: to examine the extent to which employment laws and other regulatory factors can impact-beyond cost concerns alone-the decision where to offshore, and to offer a methodology for developing attractiveness profiles that can help governments, service providers, and MNCs evaluate and improve the match between staffing needs and labor market characteristics. By examining financial considerations in conjunction with administrative and regulatory effects, the parties can better manage ongoing expansion of offshore staffing arrangements beyond more established locations such as India, China, and Malaysia. Strategic implications of a trend toward nearshoring-relocating offshore operations closer to or within the home country-are also discussed.

Analysis of Help Model Application in Smi-Arid Areas, Study on Tehran Test Cells	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Landfill; Municipal Solid Waste; Hydraulic Conductivity; Field Capacity; Leachate		Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance (HELP) model is one of the most accepted tools to simulate the hydrological attributes of landfills. Although some major deviations from real values has been reported about the calculated results for leachate generation by HELP model but other researchers and/or engineers in practice have used it in some places to estimate amount of leachate produced in the landfills. On the Other hand this model is elaborated and mainly used in developed countries with the waste having low moisture content and also in climatic conditions with high precipitation. This research investigated the applicability of the model in arid areas, by construction of two 30mx 50m (effective horizontal length) test cells in Kahrizak landfill (longitude=51 degrees, 20', latitude= 350 27' degrees), and monitoring the real leachate generation from each one. A set of field capacity and saturated water conductivity tests were also performed to determine basic hydrologic properties of municipal waste landfilled. A comparison was made between values calculated by HELP model and recorded values, shows that a prediction of leachate on annual basis can be done by HELP model with acceptable accuracy but when the infiltration of water to waste body increases due to leachate production, the model intents to underestimate water storage capacity of the landfill, which lead to deviation of calculated values from real ones.

J	Steyn, PD; du Toit, ASA				Steyn, P. D.; du Toit, A. S. A.			Investigating the potential for the development of a just-in-time knowledge management model	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article								There have been numerous approaches to knowledge management over the past number of years. The term Just-in-Time (JIT) can be defined as a production or inventory scheduling technique found within the more complex production logistics disciplines. JIT is more appropriately thought of as a philosophy, as it is more than a mere set of management and production principles. JIT knowledge management is an endeavour to provide the right knowledge at the right time to the right person. This requires insight into the knowledge demand and supply process as well as the time horizon applicable to the knowledge required. Over the longer term business forecasts, environmental scans and strategic planning can be applied to close the gap between these variables. However, it is in the short term and in the satisfaction of immediate requirements that the present systems fail and management concerns are emphasised. JIT knowledge management seeks an optimisation of the matching process between demand and supply of knowledge within enterprises, i.e. it endeavours to translate the logistic concept of JIT to the knowledge management field. In addition to JIT knowledge management the concept of real-time knowledge management is introduced as an alternative, since present research indicates that the implementation of JIT knowledge management presents major challenges in terms of cost and development effort, restricting its use to mission critical applications. A more generic application of JIT knowledge management needs to be developed and it is contended that real-time knowledge management fits the requirements of enabling the enterprise to be agile in respect of its ability to respond to knowledge demands and to be sensitive to future knowledge requirements.

J	Chen, SFS				Chen, Shih-Fen S.			TRANSACTION COST IMPLICATION OF PRIVATE BRANDING AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						private branding; transaction cost analysis; channel cooperation	MARKET; LABELS; ORGANIZATION; PERFORMANCE; INTEGRATION; INFORMATION; KNOWLEDGE	Branding and transaction cost economics represent two research streams that rarely cross paths in the literature. hi this study, I explore the transaction cost implication of private branding, a practice whereby products supplied by unaffiliated manufacturers are sold under private brands owned by retailers. The main thesis is that private branding can preempt a special case of asset specificity called brand specificity, where retailers also invest in the marketing of an outsourced product, but subsequent reputation effects (positive or negative) are specific to the manufacturer who brands the product. Retailers, thus, will not be fully motivated to optimize their investment in product marketing unless they take over the branding right. With potential barriers to private branding being controlled, data obtained from a national chain reveal that the retailer deploys its marketing resources according to the branding status of a product, implying that private branding can deflect the transaction cost of solving the brand specificity problem. The results offer new theoretical insights into branding and transaction cost analysis. This efficiency-based approach to private branding also provides practitioners with useful guidelines for crafting a branding strategy that will facilitate cooperation between manufacturers and retailers.

J	Finkelman, JM				Finkelman, Jay M.			The Need for Consistency to Avoid the Perception of Impropriety in Recruiting	PSYCHOLOGIST-MANAGER JOURNAL			English	Article								In response to an article advocating the creative use of dual job descriptions in dealing with conflicting constituencies in recruitment, this article cautions that exposure is created when a job description developed for external recruiting purposes does not accurately represent actual job requirements. If the discrepancy in job descriptions serves to the disadvantage of protected group applicants, legal exposure may result. The author argues that if one of the agendas behind the use of a second job description is to increase the probably of good fit and thus, the likelihood of success of the chosen candidate, the actual result may be dysfunctional. For a variety of strategic, psychometric, ethical, and legal reasons, recruiters should only consider using a consistent, transparent and one-dimensional approach to the development of job descriptions for recruiting and orientation. The importance of a professionally conducted job analysis and validation procedure is emphasized.

Methods We genotyped rs11655505 in 2912 female breast cancer cases and 2783 unaffected female controls from four Caucasian breast cancer studies. Results No evidence for an association between rs11655505 and breast cancer risk was found. Conclusions Our study failed to confirm a role of rs11655505 in breast cancer risk. Larger studies are necessary to determine if there is a weak association between this SNP and breast cancer risk.

Their model actually aims at studying both the role and impact of service capacity in capturing larger market share. The market share is important in maximizing individual's long-run expected profit. A Markovian queueing system of two servers was employed in their model for the captured problem. The obvious advantage of such a model is that it is mathematically tractable. They then further formulated the problem as a two-person strategic game and analyzed the equilibrium solutions. The main aim of this paper is to extend the results of their two-server queueing model to the case of a general multiple-server queueing model. Here we will focus on the case when the queueing system is stable. It is found that when the marginal cost of service capacity is low relatively to there venue per customer, a unique Nash equilibrium exists, in which all servers choose the same service capacity and the expected waiting times are finite.

J	Bang, VV; Joshi, SL				Bang, Vasant; Joshi, Sharad			Market expansion strategy-performance relationship	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						market expansion strategy; market expansion score; consumption ability; purchasing ability; willingness to buy; performance measures		Asian countries like India and China represent large untapped markets for consumer products. Hence market expansion strategy is an important strategic option in these countries. But there are hardly any studies which examine links between market expansion strategy and performance in a developing country like India. In this exploratory study a multi-item scale has been developed to measure the extent to which a company practises market expansion strategy. Four components of market expansion strategy are identified as: improving consumption and purchasing ability; improving willingness to buy; creating affordability; and improving sustainability. Overall market expansion strategy score shows a positive correlation with sales revenue and profits in case of consumer durables. But in case of non-durables the correlation is observed only with sales growth rate. Correlation of individual components with performance indicators has also been studied.

Businesses increasingly have to cope with product returns, mandated environmental regulations and increasing costs associated with product disposal. This study presents a cost-minimization model for a multi-time-step, multi-type product waste reverse logistics system. The facility location is a central issue of the logistics networks. In this article we are interested in optimizing of the sites facility location for a reverse logistics network for product end of life. Specifically, we present a Mixed Linear Program model for the strategic problem of collection sites facility location, cannibalization and recycling. This model allows determining to open or to close the sites previously in the reverse logistics network. All of these decisions are to minimize the costs of end of life product returns at various time periods considered in the planning.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Knowledge management; Intellectual capital; Simulation; Human resources strategies		Purpose - An increasing number of organizations are concerned with the internal management of talent. Over recent years there has been a proliferation of studies which attempt to quantify the value of the intangible assets held at a company, while human resource practices have taken on strategic significance for organizations, leading to a direct connection between the management of professionals and the achievement of the company's goals. The paper aims to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In response to the strategic need to maintain a distinctive offering of talent within the marketplace of professional services companies, a dynamic simulation tool has been devised and used to analyze those policies which allow the flow of professionals to be adjusted in order for a company to fulfill market expectations in the event of different demand scenarios. Findings - As a result of the analysis performed, the paper observed that a lack of flexibility within the organization tended to lead to a reduction in potential intellectual capital, and increased excess workload, together with a decline in the company's competitiveness within the marketplace, as seen in a drop in its level of corporate attractiveness. Originality/value - By using scenarios, human resource (HR) managers can learn how to balance market demands and HR needs, considering the dynamic of organizational issues. According to the results obtained, the use of dynamic simulation models, like the one developed in this project, can improve the HR planning strategy in professional services firms.

Many national park authorities (NPAs) have recognized the need to establish a more market-driven, sustainable strategic approach to develope tourism therein. For NPs, tourism marketing can serve as a powerful tool to achieve the mandated missions of protecting ecosystem, providing recreation, and fostering social-economic development in local communities, especially in the postdisaster/crisis period. Taking China's Jiuzhaigou National Park (JNP) as an example, a secondary data analysis was conducted to explore the international tourist markets for JNP before and after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Some marketing recommendations were then put forward for JNP's tourism recovery and sustainable development.

This study investigates the interaction between firms' external environment, internal resources and competences, and organisational performance. By combining industrial/organisational theory and the resource-based view, this research explores the relations between large construction SOEs and their organisational performance under evolving environmental factors. The study uses structural equations modelling of questionnaire survey data to analyse the inter-relationships of the external environment and organisations' resources and competences. Internal resources and competences are important in determining SOEs' organisational performance.

Improving efficiency and accountability: a case study on outsourcing strategies in higher education in Sri Lanka	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING			English	Article						outsourcing; higher education; Sri Lanka; public sector reforms; efficiency; accountability	POWER	Less developed countries (LDCs) have given increasing emphasis to reduce the role of the government and to reform public sector management by adopting business-like management practices. Public sector reforms in Sri Lanka have been an interesting strategic initiative in the attempt to achieve enhanced efficiency, effectiveness and accountability. Privatisation is one major form of such reforms. This research reports the findings of a case study on outsourcing at a university. Motivations for outsourcing include cost reductions and budgetary constraints, expected improvement in service quality, lack of skilled staff and government regulations. Some limitations of outsourcing are lack of mutual understanding between the user and contractor, lack of awareness of users on the level of service, monopoly of the service, increased costs and reduced employee motivation. The research concludes that through careful management and partnership with outsourcing companies, universities can achieve improved levels of service and cost savings from outsourcing.

Understanding Media Diversity: Structural and Organizational Factors Influencing Minority Employment in Local Commercial Television	JOURNAL OF BROADCASTING & ELECTRONIC MEDIA			English	Article								Diversity is a key management issue for media companies serving increasingly diverse audiences. This study uses FCC employment reports, census data, and industry data over 30 years to examine the structural and organizational factors related to minority hiring in U.S. commercial television stations. The study finds external variables explain most of the variance and draws on organizational-diversity theory to conclude industry leaders don't yet view workforce diversity as a strategic management issue.

Technology has facilitated adoption of new service models through which provide improved customer interaction. In this purview, our research paper proposes to study the feasibility of adapting CRM as a strategic tool for enhancing the competitiveness of the Indian primary education sector. This paper focuses on increasing customer interaction level and developing a CRM model, both managerial and technical which would enable greater satisfaction to the end user (organisation and customer). This paper would suggest the competitive advantage CRM can give to educational sector by helping schools to use differentiation strategy to position themselves. Technology can be viewed as a tool that would enhance the service delivery platforms by improving the customer touch points and making interactions less tedious.

J	Kiala, C				Kiala, Carine			China-Angola aid relations: strategic cooperation for development?	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS-SAJIA			English	Article						China; Angola; Africa; development aid		Until recently the international donor community has predominantly consisted of members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). However, China does not entirely conform to the OECD on matters related to aid; it is also not a member of the DAC. Hence, the data on China's aid, as well as its focus, purpose, terms and conditions are controversial because they are not clear. Furthermore, on the receiving end, Angola is equally reticent to discuss its management of state funds. The uncertainties and the opaque nature of diplomatic relations are compounded by a perceived overlap and ambiguity between aid and investment. The objective of the study is to examine China-Angola aid relations and provide critical judgement of it characterising strategic cooperation for the development of Angola.

Assessment of the impact of various mitigation options on nitrous oxide emissions caused by the agricultural sector in Europe	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES			English	Article						modeling; nitrogen; green house gases; land use; land management; farming practice		A European Union (EU-27) wide N2O emission estimate for the agricultural sector is presented, using the INTEGRATOR model, combined with detailed GIS-based environmental data and farming data. INTEGRATOR links various modules, calculating NH3, NOx, N2O, CO2, and CH4 emissions from housing and manure storage systems, agricultural and non-agricultural soils and surface waters, while accounting for the interaction between agricultural and non-agricultural systems through an emission-deposition model for NH3 and NOx. This study is limited to N2O emissions from housing and manure storage systems and agricultural soils. All emissions are based on N2O emission factors which depend on environment (weather and soil conditions), land use (grassland, arable land, crop residues), and management (type of manure and fertilizer, etc). We assessed the plausibility by a comparison of calculated present nitrous oxide emissions at country level with those derived by more simple emission factor approaches and detailed ecosystem models. The model was used to assess the impact of various farming practice packages to mitigate N2O emissions. For the agricultural sector of the EU-27, a total N2O emission of 347 kton N2O-N is calculated for the year 2000, which is comparable to other estimates. The overall achievable reduction in N2O emissions with the evaluated mitigation measures is about 25%. For the EU-27, the most effective measures are balanced fertilization and maximum manure application, but this is highly variable per country.

J	Liu, JJ; Wang, Y; Zheng, G				Liu, Jingjiang; Wang, Yi; Zheng, Gang			Driving forces and organisational configurations of international R&D: the case of technology-intensive Chinese multinationals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						R&D internationalisation; multinational corporations; MNCs; driving forces; organisational configurations; home-base-augmenting R&D; strategic R&D; innovation capabilities; developing countries; China	INDUSTRIAL-RESEARCH; DEVELOPMENT LABORATORIES; JAPANESE MNCS; INNOVATION; GLOBALIZATION; CORPORATIONS; ENTERPRISES; MANAGEMENT; PATTERNS; TRIANGULATION	International R&D by multinational corporations (MNCs) from developing countries is on the increase. Some technology-intensive Chinese MNCs, which arc playing an increasingly significant role in carrying out Chinese innovation strategies, have recently established global R&D networks. Based on the evidence from two technology-intensive Chinese MNCs in the telecommunications equipment industry, this paper focuses specifically on exploring the driving forces and organisational configurations of international R&D in these MNCs. Our findings and results show, firstly, that establishing home-base-augmenting/strategic R&D sites in developed and other developing countries is the predominant driving force behind R&D internationalisation in these Chinese MNCs. Secondly, in terms of the dispersion of R&D activities and the degree of cooperation between individual R&D units, each of these MNCs has successively gone through different organisational configurations of international R&D at its three strategic stages: ethnocentric centralised R&D, geocentric centralised R&D, and R&D hub model.

The data are collected using a mailed questionnaire survey to manufacturing companies in Klang Valley. Results of this study showed that, the level of management accounting practices in Malaysian manufacturing companies were consistent with the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) frameworks on the management accounting evolution. The results also identified technological advancement and strategic change as important predictors of change in MACS. Taken together, these research outcomes make an incremental contribution to the existing management accounting change literature by providing useful insights into our knowledge of management accounting innovation specifically for developing economies.

Also the number of studies about this issue has been rising relatively. However the previous research on super high rise buildings focused mostly on the use of public space from building plan perspective, survey 'of residents' satisfaction evaluation, construction technology and structural technology. Little research is done on the economic analysis of landmark factors. The purpose of this study is to find landmark factors that can be quantitatively measured, collect data on super high rise residential buildings in Seoul. Find the intrinsic values of the landmarks, and analyze how these values differ in areas with different densities, i.e. in Gangnam-area and Yeongdeungpo-gu and in other areas. It is expected that the results of this study can be used to set an appropriate price of super high rise building in consideration of its landmark value in different area.

J	Morgan, CW; Burchell, J				Morgan, Colin W.; Burchell, Jon			"It ain't wot you do, it's the way that you do it'' Lessons learned from analysing employer-supported volunteering schemes through the eyes of employees	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY			English	Article						United Kingdom; Business ethics; Citizen participation; Citizenship; Social responsibility; Employees involvement		Purpose - This paper seeks to understand the views of employees in a UK company on an employee vounteering (ESV) scheme. It further seeks to advance theory in this area by integrating organisational identity (OI) and organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB). The paper moves forward the scholarly work on ESV by interviewing employees who do and do not volunteer within ESV schemes. Design/methodology/approach - A purpose sample of 31 (n = 31) interviewees was drawn from all levels of the studied organisation. The method follows a qualitative approach using NVIVO as the analysis tool. The interview was triangulated using a focus group. Findings - Employees have a range of emotions and responses to a company operating an ESV scheme. The study is particularly interesting in that it studies employees of a gambling organisation that bring in further rich employee views on the scheme. Much of the sparse literature on ESV does not pick up on UK-based organisations and this study is therefore revealing. Research limitations/implications - Managers of corporate responsibility (CR) in organisations should be concerned with how they implement their CR programmes - especially with respect to how they establish and communicate ESV programmes. Academics will find value in viewing ESV through a conjunction of OCB and OI theories. The research could be replicated in other large UK organisations with similiar ESV programmes to test whether the experiences of employees are widespread in other organisations. Practical implications - The paper tacitly questions the impact of ESV programmes on the employee stakeholder group and suggests that, unless ESV programmes are well run and well communicated and given a good budget, employees may in fact view the programme negatively. It demonstrates that CR is not simply a "nice to have'' that can be simply bolted on. Social implications - Organisations, especially those in the third sector that work with corporates, need to understand the role of ESV schemes in their partner companies and consider the views of employees and the strategic logic of the companies before embarking on working together. Originality/value - This is an original piece of work in a relatively under-researched area. This is the first study to consider volunteers and non-volunteers in an ESV scheme in a UK-based company - the added dimension of interest and value is that the studied organisation was a gambling business.

J	Park, H; Kincade, DH				Park, Hyejune; Kincade, Doris H.			Historical Analysis of Apparel Marketer's Strategies: Evidence from a Nike Case	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL FASHION MARKETING			English	Article						Apparel industry; Nike; Case study; Marketing strategy; Historical analysis	IMPORT INTERMEDIARIES; INDUSTRY	In the decades previous to 2010, many firms in consumer product industries, including the apparel industry, have experienced changes both in the structure of the industries (e.g., ownership, control and location of production) and the functions of the firms (e.g., production- or product oriented vs. marketing-oriented) within the industries (Su et al., 2009). One force in this change was the economic globalization that brought about shifts of production and trade from domestic production to off-shore sourcing of production and then of fabrication and design (Ha-Brookshire and Dyer, 2009). Gereffi (1994) argued that the continued interest in this dynamic of globalization in the apparel industry may remain because global restructuring of the economy is historical in shifts of power across commodity chains. As a major industry in the global market, this argument emphasizes the importance of historical analysis for the apparel industry. However, a review of literature revealed that only a few academic studies (e.g., Kincade, 1995; Locker, 2002) have explored issues such as specific details about the growth and change in the apparel industry, and even fewer studies placed these issues in a historical context. The current study is designed to fill this gap in the literature and provide insights into the historical perspective of the U.S. apparel firms' response changes in its business environment over the last four decades and the importance of the marketing function within this context. The objectives of this study were: (1) to analyze a U.S. apparel company's shift in organization and strategies in a historical perspective, and (2) to provide relevance of these findings within economic globalization. To achieve the research objectives, a sample company's case with general industry trends from 1970s to 2009, were investigated. This time frame was determined based on the early 1970s as a beginning point of much of the apparel industry restructure in response to the economic globalization (Taplin, 1994) and with the consideration of data availability for a sample company and its year of establishment. The sampling frame of this study consisted of the companies ranked in The Top Company lists (e.g., The Top 50, The Top 40) in Apparel magazine Among the seven companies continuously listed during the period of study, Nike, Inc. was selected as the sample for this case study because of the extensive availability of historical data (e.g., data beginning in the 1970s) about Nike and its continued growth and leadership. The case study covered four decades from the 1968, the year that Nike was incorporated, to 2009. In the first period from 1968 to 1975, Nike emphasized production and distribution related to imports and trade. By emphasizing principal business activities (i.e., designing, selling the products) and outsourcing all manufacturing in Japan and other countries, Nike initiated global sourcing in the late 1960s. This strategy became a trend that most other companies would eventually follow throughout the next several decades. In the second period between 1976 and 1983, Nike focused on product innovation with technology to exceed over other competitors (e.g., Adidas, Puma). Through this strategy a new product model, the Air shoe, was developed, which significantly contributed to a reversal in declining sales. In the third period, 1984 to 1996, Nike's innovative advertising started with the endorsement contract by Michael Jordan. The endorsement strategy built a strong foundation for Nike as a marketing company. Marketing strategies, developed for reinforcing the brand image with its Swoosh logo, the slogan "Just do it," and endorsements with famous athletes, strengthened Nike's strategic reorientation as it changed from a traditionally focused production-oriented company to a more flexible and reactive marketing-oriented company. Finally, from 1997 to 2009, Nike has diversified its marketing efforts and taken leadership in the industry. Nike's advanced marketing strategies include market diversification through branding and niche segmentation (e.g., casual apparel for women, golf shoes), further product innovation with technology (e.g., Nike Plus, Flywire, Swift Apparel), inventive advertising campaigns, and restructuring management operations. Nike's business strategies exemplified efforts to become more consumer-reactive over the last four decades. Working with dedicated overseas contractors, Nike developed a flexible business structure and maintained a profitably reactive apparel firm. To function as the ultimate marketer and consumer centric company, Nike readjusted its business strategy from a production-orientation to a marketing-orientation to the goal of being a consumer-oriented company during the decades from the late 1960s to 2009. The case study of Nike well supports the organizational learning theory literature for the apparel industry (e.g., Dyer and Ha-Brookshire, 2008; Kincade, 2002) in that Nike continuously redefined its business strategies as it achieved the key goals for each business period in response to the changing global environment. Following a basic organizational learning approach to strategic planning, Nike focused on what it could do best with available resources, what would be innovative, creative and market-leading, and what would sell to the consumer. In conclusion, Nike's strategic business responses to a changing and global environment were varied and related to the company's structure and the business at the time. Historical analysis confirmed that although various strategies were stressed for each period of time, all strategies were implemented as a part of Nike's overall business planning and were market reactive. The examination of the Nike case study provides support for the general organizational learning theory (e.g., Jemison 1981; Ward and Duray, 2000) and the apparel specific theory proposed by Park and Kincade (in press). Staying reactive with marketing-oriented strategy has become a key strategy for Nike and maybe useful for other firms to achieve competitiveness in a changing market.

Findings - Brand community members responded differently to the repositioning of the brand, according to the core benefit or value they first sought by attending the Club, from the functional and practical to the emotional or experiential reward. Responses also differed according to whether consumers valued the collective ideals of the earlier Club Med or the individualism advocated in the latest positioning. Hence, the value match between brand and consumers appeared predictive of their response. Research limitations/implications - Although limited to the case of one iconic service brand, these findings have implications for marketers. In particular, they warn against unilateral decisions made without due consideration of the brand community which may have developed around the traditional meanings associated with the brand. Originality/value - Given the paucity of evidence of service brand community, validating the existence of service brand community represents a first and important contribution of the paper. Brand communities have intrigued researchers and practitioners by their loyalty and resilience. Moreover, little or no research has examined how such communities cope with dramatic changes in the brand strategy.

On the ground, it was observed that the prices of construction materials, labour and plant rose suddenly in the affected regions making the reconstruction effort more costly. This paper considers the responses of major economic and construction indicators to the construction shock due to post-tsunami reconstruction and the amount of time needed before they returned to an equilibrium state. Empirical results indicate that the construction output shock had a significant impact on material, labour and equipment price indices in the short run but other indicators showed only a very marginal response indicating that the remoteness of the disaster would have delayed the propagation.

Traffic Control: Current Systems and Future Vision of Cities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						Traffic management; Cities; Comparative study		This paper summarises the results from a questionnaire-based survey and follow-up discussions with traffic operations staff of various cities in the world. The questionnaire asked cities about their currently employed control systems as well as about their organization's vision for the future. Data collected include details on traffic management techniques employed, if network monitoring is carried out and if yes, how, as well as about details on the traffic control centre itself. Efforts were further made to collect data on the city background such as population density, modal share and traffic safety which forms the basis to understand why particular solutions were chosen. The answers demonstrate some issues with definitions which are believed to exist not just in our data set but in many of the commonly referred to statistics. The results further show differences between cities as well as common issues and problems that need innovative solutions in the future for sustainable transportation policies. As several cities are currently in the process of defining longer-term strategic plans with similar goals the paper proposes that development of comparable evaluation measures helps municipal traffic managers to better select between available technical solutions.

J	Seppanen, M; Makinen, S				Seppanen, Marko; Makinen, Saku			Resources in academic discourse: An empirical investigation of management journals	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-JIEM			English	Article						resources; discourse; strategic management; category; competitive advantage		Commonly shared conceptualizations of resources are scant in academic management research which strikes as somewhat peculiar since resources and their allocation thereof have long been recognised to be at the heart of the competitive advantage and performance of a firm. The research literature considering resources as basis for competitive advantages has further faced contemporary criticism for the vagueness of the fundamental definition of the resource concept. Therefore, this paper empirically studies the representation of resource concept in academic management research literature. The paper reports results on the state of conceptualisations of organisations' resources found in two distinct sources of research literature, namely ScienceDirect's database and ISI's top management journals, resulting in two data sets of a total of 457 articles. The findings illustrate the two-dimensional conceptual farrago in the conceptualisations; on the definitions of the resource concept itself and on the internal structure and the level of analysis when the concept is considered. In addition, the paper sheds light on the temporal evolution of the discourse explicitly considering resources. Finally, the paper considers several remedies for these deficiencies in order both to aid future theory development in management studies and to help increase the practical impact of the research in assisting managerial decision-making.

J	Storrud-Barnes, SF; Reed, R; Jessup, LM				Storrud-Barnes, Susan F.; Reed, Richard; Jessup, Leonard M.			Uncertainty, risk preference, and new-venture strategies	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Uncertainty management; Risk management; Entrepreneurs; Corporate ventures; Management strategy; Product innovation	DETERMINANTS; MANAGEMENT; ENTRY; PERCEPTIONS; INVESTMENTS; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; DECISION; OPTIONS; MODEL	Purpose - Conventional wisdom holds that the difference between entrepreneurs and managers is large, while uncertainty and risk are virtually interchangeable. Uncertainty and risk are treated as separate constructs and then real-options thinking and prospect theory are drawn upon to determine how they affect the actions of entrepreneurs and managers. The purpose of this paper is to determine specifically, how the above constructs interact to affect the strategies entrepreneurs and managers are likely to adopt when undertaking new ventures. Design/methodology/approach - The research uses deductive theorizing to build a theoretical model. Findings - Contrary to conventional wisdom, it is concluded that the difference between entrepreneurs and managers is less than believed, while the effect of the difference between uncertainty and risk is larger. It is determined that entrepreneurs and managers use similar strategies when faced with similar conditions of uncertainty and when they have similar risk preferences. When environmental uncertainty is low, risk-seeking entrepreneurs and managers will prefer licensing, whereas the risk averse will prefer wholly owned new ventures. When environmental uncertainty is neither high nor low, both risk-averse and risk-seeking entrepreneurs and managers will prefer alliances. When environmental uncertainty is high, risk-averse entrepreneurs and managers will prefer licensing, whereas risk seekers will prefer wholly owned. Originality/value - By separating uncertainty and risk, this research is able to show how their interactions become the drivers of strategic decisions by entrepreneurs and managers. This is new to the literature, and the work thus reveals an opportunity for further sophistication of strategy theory and an opportunity to reduce the barriers between theory on entrepreneurship and management theory.

The objective of the study is an evaluation of their influence on outage costs deriving from the adoption of automatic equipment in managing distribution systems. Design/methodology/approach - Cost and benefit calculations in this paper are made for a typical North European rural medium-voltage network. The benefits are calculated in terms of outage costs for each of the above-presented applications and compared with the investment cost, including the annual cost of maintenance, of the DMS. The empirical results and validation of the theoretical calculations are performed by an electric utility, where the DMS benefit evaluation is taking place. Findings - By capitalizing the applications of the DMS, it is possible to acquire considerable benefits in outage costs. It is shown that the greatest cost-based benefits are obtained from the fault location and field crew management applications. The case study further shows that the DMS can reduce the operation costs of utilities. Research limitations/implications - The calculations are based on network expert assumptions about System Average Interruption Duration (SAIDI), carried out for a specific overhead-line network operating in a specific European rural medium-voltage environment. Sharing of utilities' de facto SAIDI results as a basis for calculations would decrease the need for subjective expert assumptions in the future analyses. Practical implications - Application of the proposed framework for decision making and lessons learned can support electric utilities when planning for unbundling and strategic target-setting in the unbundled business model. Originality/value - There are few reports available on similar actual DMS-application-based cost benefits due to the nature of private utility information that is preferably not disclosed.

Based on the relaxation of several of the unrealistic assumptions in classic economic theory, it also illustrates how corporate entrepreneurship can be an important driver of change in the firm's environment. More specifically, the article demonstrates that 1 one important consequence of entrepreneurship is the creation of more business opportunities, leading to an ever-abundant availability of new business potential 2 these opportunities can be classified into three categories based on how they come into existence, and by whom they are exploited 3 this leads to implications regarding strategic approaches to venture selection and pursuit. Each opportunity type is illustrated with examples from the online computer gaming industry. A number of preliminary managerial implications are presented, based on differences in the creation and nature of opportunities in each category.

Although disasters may end many opportunities and lives, the lives of survivors do not cease in the disaster affected areas. The impact of natural disasters and the consequent partial reconstruction efforts have specifically presented many challenges to women. In this context, the main research investigates the empowerment of women during post disaster reconstruction particularly in Sri Lanka. Among the factors that influence women's empowerment, existing policies and frameworks is one of the important factors that can play a major role within the post disaster reconstruction in Sri Lanka. Hence, in order to gain an understanding of the existing framework of women's empowerment, this study investigates the national and international policies and frameworks that exist within the post disaster context in Sri Lanka. The study found that even though polices are gender neutral, they are not gender sensitive. In addition, it was found that having a single policy or framework for the whole country is unlikely to be a success, therefore, any frameworks should have room to be adopted to the local situation.

In special literature there are various approaches proposed to what decision support system (DSS) is rational to use in management area. This diversity is determined by the nature of management problems, goals and the chosen approaches for achieving the goals. In order to prepare the approaches which are necessary to carry out the strategic planning in the institutions, the role of the DSS was revealed, the structure of the system was defined, and the variety of the DSS was systematized. Besides, the factors which predetermine the requirements for the DSS of strategic planning in the institutions were defined. According to these factors and the results of the research on theoretical potential of decision support, it is rational to apply a complex character of intelligent support to prepare alternatives and to make decisions of strategic planning in public institutions. The authors have based a solution with regard to the integrated DSS for the strategic planning.

J	Wang, F; Liu, JC; Sun, LM				Wang, Feng; Liu, Jiangchuan; Sun, Limin			Ambient Data Collection with Wireless Sensor Networks	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article								One of the most important applications for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is Data Collection, where sensing data are collected at sensor nodes and forwarded to a central base station for further processing. Since using battery powers and wireless communications, sensor nodes can be very small and easily attached at specified locations without disturbing surrounding environments. This makes WSN a competitive approach for data collection comparing with its wired counterpart. In this paper, we review recent advances in this research area. We first highlight the special features of data collection WSNs, by comparing with wired data collection network and other WSN applications. With these features in mind, we then discuss issues and prior solutions on the data gathering protocol design. Our discussion also covers different approaches for message dissemination, which is a critical component for network control and management and greatly affects the overall performance of a data collection WSN system.

J	Whitford, AB				Whitford, Andrew B.			The hierarchical consequences of reinvention: evidence from the American bureaucracy	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT HISTORY			English	Article						Organizational development; Conflict resolution; Strategic change; Public sector reform; Public administration; United States of America		Purpose - Political reorganizations like that of the national performance review in the USA fundamentally alter hierarchical relations within public agencies. This paper includes a set of formal exercises to examine two logical consequences of reinvention: the increased likelihood of coordination failures, and the reduction in political leaders' hierarchical status in the organization. Design/methodology/approach - These effects are discussed in the context of a substantial change in the public organization of health services: the alteration of the US Department of Health and Human Services' structure. Findings - The paper argues that reinvention fundamentally alters the power and status of political appointees, the standing of top leadership, and the likelihood of conflict resolution within the organization. Originality/value - This is the first paper to use historically important methods of understanding conflict resolution in organizations to the most important reform effort in American public administration in the last 30 years.

This research takes into account earthquake effects on treatment plants and pumping stations in wastewater systems as a lifeline. Wastewater treatment plants in four earthquake prone areas in New Zealand were selected for the purpose of assessing their vulnerabilities to earthquakes. Results showed that simple upgraded wastewater treatment plants are the most vulnerable type of wastewater treatment plants in New Zealand. Earthquake vulnerability of 45 wastewater pumping stations in 3 earthquake prone cities in New Zealand was also assessed. The assessment proved that non-structural components are among the most vulnerable parts in wastewater pumping stations. Since structural vulnerability of some wastewater pumping stations is notable, it requires a need for an immediate rehabilitation plan.

Based on the business strategy literature and literature on technology policy, we test the relative importance of a firm's strategies and government as a buyer and champion. Our empirical findings stress the value of government championing behavior. Our results show that in road construction, championing behavior is more important than public technology procurement for project performance. The results even suggest that government championship is more important than a firm's strategic orientation.	[Halman, Johannes I.

J	Deng, XM				Deng, Xinming			Patterns of internationalization of Chinese firms-empirical study based on strategic approach	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS			English	Article								In this study, firstly we provide an analytical framework for international activities, which are of theoretically significant importance to research and understand the patterns of internationalization. Then, we take 500 top Chinese enterprises as study objects and analyse deeply the behaviour of their FDI (foreign direct investment) scenario from three aspects, namely motivations, entry modes and location choices. The results reveal that: (1) Chinese companies' internationalization is still at the early stage and has not reached the upstream value chain of internationalization; (2) the internationalization business of Chinese companies is diversified in destinations; (3). Chinese companies' modes of entering overseas markets are flexible and most companies have actively tried diverse entry modes with more adaptability; (4) the rapid increase of the FDI by the transnational strategic assets-seeking companies shows that Chinese companies are inclined to protect and improve competitive advantages through obtaining new assets rather than making use of existing competitive advantages as before. Some implications of findings are also discussed finally. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Cancer in older people: a tale of two disciplines	INTERNAL MEDICINE JOURNAL			English	Article						cancer; geriatrics; oncology; older people	COMPREHENSIVE GERIATRIC ASSESSMENT; CLINICAL-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS; INTERNATIONAL-SOCIETY; ONCOLOGY SIOG; TASK-FORCE; RENAL-INSUFFICIENCY; MEDICINE COCARE; HIP-FRACTURES; BREAST-CANCER; MANAGEMENT	Management of cancer in the elderly presents an unprecedented challenge in Australia with the proportion of the population aged over 65 years set to double over the next four decades. Despite the complex healthcare needs of the older patient with cancer, there is currently little communication or cooperation between the fields of oncology and geriatrics. Improved interdisciplinary communication would facilitate care that is framed within current oncology practice while taking account of physiological age, complex comorbidities, risk of adverse events and pharmacological interactions as well as the implications of cognitive impairment on suitability for treatment and consent. An important first step has been taken towards the development of a strategic, focused and collaborative approach to the management of cancer in older people through a national interdisciplinary workshop convened by the Clinical Oncological Society of Australia in April 2008. Engagement and commitment of both oncology and geriatric disciplines is now critical to ensure that momentum is not lost in progressing this important and growing area of healthcare.	[Steer, C.

JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						race; ethnicity; test preparation; job knowledge tests; Mathew Effect	ACHIEVEMENT-TEST PERFORMANCE; COGNITIVE-ABILITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; VALIDITY; STRATEGIES; ACQUISITION; EMPLOYMENT; SELECTION; PROGRAMS; POINTS	Using afield sample, the authors examined the extent to which race is related to test preparation and whether test preparation is related to test performance. They found that African Americans reported more self-initiated test preparation than Caucasians did and that tutorial attendance and self-initiated test preparation were related to test performance. Moreover, the authors found that only self-initiated test preparation mediated the race-performance relationship. Last, the hypothesis that the Matthew Effect (defined as the amplification of any initial advantage that leads to cumulative effects) would hold in an employment setting was not supported. The implications of test preparation are discussed.

J	Galinec, D				Galinec, Darko			Procurement Business Service Modeling in ServiceBased Process Architecture of Equipping System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE SERVICE SECTOR			English	Article						Business Process Management; Business Service Model; Process Architecture; Process Owner; Service Oriented Architecture		The procurement as business discipline and function of equipping process has started the process of transformation from an administrative competence and necessity to a strategic capability (Kyte, 2006). To be efficient its processes have to be interoperable in the processing, semantic and technological way with other functions and processes of the business system; end to end process integration of the business system should be obtained. It is important to fully understand and document user requirements before development of the procurement (business) process. This results in the need for the development of a defined, articulated, communicated and managed model of procurement process. On the level of conceptual system modeling (business process owner's perspective) (ZIFA, 2006) this article shapes a new procurement model, in form of business service with appertaining processes, activities and other services necessary for its accomplishment. At logical and physical modeling level (designer's and builder's perspective) (ZIFA, 2006) service oriented perspective (SOA) has been considered, as well as Web services as technological concept for the implementation of the shaped procurement service model at the conceptual level of the system. Application of the shaped model requires organizational, process and system changes of the business system, that is, procurement function must develop the culture of service provider, avoiding the role of corporate purchasing controller. The position and the role of business service modeling within entire business process management (BPM) discipline has been established as well.

J	Hallin, CA; Ogaard, T; Marnburg, E				Hallin, Carina Antonia; Ogaard, Torvald; Marnburg, Einar			Exploring Qualitative Differences in Knowledge Sources: A Study of Hierarchical Effects of Judgmental Confidence and Accuracy Performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Accuracy; Confidence; Intuition; Judgments; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Sharing; Knowledge Sources; Strategic Capital		Focusing on knowledge management (KM) and strategic decision making in service businesses through the constructs of strategic capital and knowledge sharing, the study investigates qualitative differences in domain-specific knowledge of frontline employees and executives. The study draws on cognitive theory and investigates the extend to which the knowledge of these subject groups is correct with respect to incorporating intuitive judgments by various employee groups into forecasting and following strategic decision making. The authors carried out this investigation through an exploratory study of the subject groups' confidence and accuracy (CA) performance in a constructed knowledge-based forecasting setting. The groups' intuitive judgmental performances were examined when predicting uncertain business and industry-related outcomes. The authors surveyed 39 executives and 38 frontline employees in 12 hotels. The analysis is based on a between-participants design. The results from this setting do not fully confirm findings in earlier CA studies. Their results indicate that there are no significant differences in the accuracy of executives (as experts) and frontline employees (as novices). Although executives demonstrate overconfidence in their judgments and frontline employees demonstrate underconfidence, in line with earlier CA theory of experts and novices, the differences we find are not significant. Similarly, the CA calibration performance difference between the two groups is not significant. They suggest, among other reasons, that our findings differ from earlier CA studies because of organizational politics and culture by power distance, social capital, misuse of knowledge and the size of the business.

By the application of 'Data Envelopment Analysis' (DEA) the efficiency level was determined for 13 mechanisation working units in the forestry. The efficiency of working units was estimated taking into consideration their business results and quanti. ties of hazardous waste produced during their operations. Projections were made of inefficientunits against the efficiency frontier, and sources and levels of inefficiency were established The results show that the DEA may be an extremely useful tool both at a strategic and operational level of decision making in forestry. The paper also shows the advantages and possibilities provided to the management by DEA application, as well as some limitations of this model. (C) 2009 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

J	Brink, A				Brink, Alexander			Hirschman's Rhetoric of Reaction: US and German Insights in Business Ethics	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article						Albert O. Hirschman; business ethics; corporate social responsibility; political economy; political sciences; rhetoric of reaction	STAKEHOLDER THEORY; SMITH,ADAM; BAD	In recent times, representatives of American management science have been arguing increasingly for a functionalization of ethics to change economic thinking: what they are seeking is the systematic integration of ethics into the economic paradigm. Using the insights developed by Hirschman, I would like to show how one must first expose the rhetoric of those critics of change (referred to below as conservatives or reactionaries) in order then to implement that which is new (representatives of this approach are referred to below as progressives). Such an aEuro(1)unmasking' works particularly well when one can defuse the arguments of the reactionaries - which is precisely what one achieves by strategically integrating ethics into economics. In his work The Rhetoric of Reaction Hirschman examines three basic forms of reactionary thought: the perversity thesis, the futility thesis, and the jeopardy thesis. According to the perversity thesis, intended goals are transformed into their opposites. The futility thesis argues that the setting of goals is useless since history runs its own course independent of those goals. The jeopardy thesis claims to preserve what already exists since change might substantially endanger that which has already been achieved. The importance of Hirschman's ideas for the strategic interplay between the academic disciplines can be seen quite clearly in the example of German business ethics. This will be displayed below with reference to Hirschman's three theses. Finally, implications will be drawn for business ethics in general and for management theory in particular.

In this paper, we trace the academic and commercial pedigree of Ipsos 'brand-building platform, review its core components, summarise what we have learned over 30 years of commercial research in the area and lay out a path for future innovation in this space. We draw on existing approaches in both consumer behaviour and economic choice modelling to develop a framework that provides, in addition to commonly used equity metrics, the impact of brand positionings, price and loyalty on consumer choice, and how these metrics can be combined to evaluate a brand's total asset value. In addition, our framework lays the foundation for an integrated systems model of brand equity and choice that, we believe, is better suited to addressing the questions of critical importance to brand managers across a wide variety of categories.

J	Doherty, NA; Lamm-Tennant, J				Doherty, Neil A.; Lamm-Tennant, Joan			Lessons from the Financial Crisis on Risk and Capital Management: The Case of Insurance Companies	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CORPORATE FINANCE			English	Article								This article proposes that risk management be viewed as an integral part of the corporate value-creation processone in which the concept of economic capital can provide companies with the financial cushion and confidence to carry out their strategic plans. Using the case of insurance and reinsurance companies, the authors discuss three main ways that the integration of risk and capital management creates value: (1) strengthening solvency (by limiting the probability of financial distress); (2) increasing prospects for profitable growth (by preserving access to capital during post-loss periods); and (3) improving transparency (by increasing the "information content" or "signaling power" of reported earnings). Insurers can manage solvency risk by using Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) models to limit the probability of financial distress to levels consistent with the firm's specified risk tolerance. While ERM models are effective in managing "known" risks, we discuss three practices widely used in the insurance industry to manage "unknown" and "unknowable" risks using the logic of real options-slack, mutualization, and incomplete contracts. Second, risk management can create value by securing sources of capital that, like contingent capital, can be used to fund profitable growth opportunities that tend to arise in periods following large losses. Finally, the authors argue that risk management can raise the confidence of investors in their estimates of future growth by removing the "noise" in earnings that comes from bearing noncore risks, thereby making current earnings a more reliable guide to future earnings. In support of this possibility, the authors provide evidence showing that, for a given level of reported return on equity (ROE), (re) insurers with more stable ROEs have higher price-to-book ratios, suggesting investors' willingness to pay a premium for the stability provided by risk management.

CHINA-UNITED STATES TRADE NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES: THE WTO AND BEYOND	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WTO & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH LAW AND POLICY			English	Article						China-US relations; Strategic Economic Dialogue; WTO disputes; TPRM; TRM; DSU		This article examines trade negations and disputes between China and the United States. It begins by ascertaining the unique political aspects of China-U.S. bilateral economic ties and explains the historical background underlying the relations. The article then argues that trade frictions between China and the United States are unlikely to repeat the Depression-era trade wars. The article observes that both the Chinese and U.S. governments are aware that the adoption of WTO-inconsistent measures may result in retaliatory actions from the other side. Hence, the two governments have attempted to resolve potential disputes through high-level official talks. Even when certain issues cannot be solved through dialogue, the WTO dispute settlement system has proven to be efficient as an instrument of final resort to deal with bilateral trade frictions. Finally, the article submits that the change in China's attitude toward WTO disputes further integrates the country into the international economic order and paves the way for a more positive development of China-U.S. trade relations.

The authors present two viable strategies for survival: The 'Just Good Enough' strategy allows brands to offer acceptable quality at a value price, while the 'Altered Amortisation' strategy attempts to position brands as a value when considered over an extended period of time. The authors demonstrate how to apply their framework and offer numerous examples of brands and industries that can take advantage of its strategic potential.

Law firms seeking to represent the interests of internationally active corporate clients must embrace and systematically apply concepts of strategic management and planning and install corporate business structures to sustain competition for lucrative clients. These measures bear a high conflict potential with the core values of legal ethics. However, we observe in parallel a global consolidation of these core values through an enhanced cooperation of national professional bodies, the use of international codes, and comparative legal ethics teaching and research. Furthermore, state regulation of the legal profession is concerned with preserving the core values of legal ethics to conserve the lawyer's role in upholding the rule of law. This article defends that legal ethics is adapting to the pressures exerted by "managerial" approaches to legal practice without this altering core values that underlie legal ethics.

J	Lin, CT; Chen, YM				Lin, Chun-Ta; Chen, Yee Ming			Hedging strategic flexibility in the distribution optimization problem	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						GARCH model for forecasting; Forward option pricing model for inventory hedge; Supply chain network	INVENTORY MANAGEMENT; LEAD-TIME; STOCK	Motivated by the increasing prevalence of flexibility hedging in corporate-level risk management programs, this paper focuses on the treatment of hedging operational risks in the coordinated replenishment and shipment for distribution systems. The forward option pricing model with the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model for stochastic demand forecasting is adopted for constructing inventory volume flexibility. We therefore propose a hedge-based coordinated inventory replenishment and shipment (HORS) methodology for flexibly making inventory hedging and optimal routing assignment decisions as well as coordinating replenishment and shipment policies. The HCIRS methodology provides insight into strategic flexibility adopted for a real-life inventory-distribution problem faced by one of the major East Asia food supply networks and turns out to be very efficient. The proposed HORS methodology has provided evidence of better results than the traditional operational techniques for the presented case in this (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Electronic Surveillance of Testicular Cancer: Understanding Patient Perspectives on Access to Electronic Medical Records	JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article								Purpose: To understand patient perceptions and attitudes regarding online access to testicular cancer surveillance test results, and to identify factors that may be important in maximizing referencing of electronic medical records (EMRs) by patients for these results. Methods: In this qualitative study, seven focus groups were conducted with a total of 22 patients undergoing surveillance for testicular cancer. Transcript data were analyzed iteratively using combined manual and computerized coding by two independent coders to generate a theoretic framework grounded in the data. Results: Practicality, meaning of information, patient-physician relationship, risk of recurrence, and role of technology were identified as interrelated factors that frame how patients regard potential surveillance technology. The influence of each factor hinged on its relationship with reassurance-the central predominant factor. Additionally, time since start of surveillance seemed to affect the relative importance of all other factors. Conclusion: Prevailing models of technology acceptance understate the complexity of the situation of the patient user and the implications of online access to health information. Surveillance for testicular cancer seems to be a suitable context for patient access to EMR information if patient perspectives are to be understood and considered. Reassurance is the overriding element influencing attitudes.

Strategic communication management by NPOs in the adult-literacy sector in south africa	COMMUNICARE-JOURNAL FOR COMMUNICATION SCIENCES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article								The Steyn and Puth (2000) model for strategic communication management has been applied by students and other project participants to non-profit organisations (NPOs), government institutions and small and medium enterprises in South Africa, but organisations' communication practices have not been measured against the model. This paper reports on the strategic communication management practices of NPOs in the adult-literacy sector in South Africa, as compared with the strategic steps in the Steyn and Puth model. The aim of this study was to analyse current communication practices in the adult-literacy sector of South African NPOs in terms of the normative, theoretical Steyn and Puth model for strategic communication management. The purpose was to understand the participating NPOs' operational and strategic communication management context, since little research in this regard has to date been conducted. Recommendations for strategic communication management and relationship building by NPOs are also made.	[Wiggill, M. N.; Fourie, L.

The authors present an overview of the dynamic stochastic programming techniques involved and briefly describe the nature of Pioneer Investment's proprietary CASM simulator from which the asset class returns and pension scheme liabilities are generated. The stochastic optimization model is described precisely in the article as well as its solution using linear programming. To illustrate the approach, the authors offer two examples of defined benefit schemes using simple, conservative, fund liability models. The optimal dynamic asset allocations of the two examples reflect the motivation of second generation liability-driven investment schemes. Although the final salary scheme models are simple, more complex models can be incorporated with little extra effort into the system described by the authors. Most actuarial assessments used in practice can be modeled for this purpose.	[Dempster, Michael A. H.] Univ Cambridge, Stat Lab, Ctr Financial Res, Cambridge CB2 1SB, England; [Dempster, Michael A.

Strategic implications of alternative learning approaches in customization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MARKETING			English	Article						Customization; Personalization; Learning; Competitive strategy; Customer relationship management	MASS CUSTOMIZATION; PRICE-COMPETITION; FIRM PERFORMANCE; USER DESIGN; PRODUCTS; DETERMINANTS; ORIENTATION; ACQUISITION; MANAGEMENT; RETENTION	Learning about a customer's preferences is a critical first step in the customization process. Broadly, firms adopt two alternative learning approaches: (1) ask, i.e., solicit preference information directly from the customer (S-Learning), or (2) infer, i.e., deduce preference information based on past observations of the customer as well as those of other customers (O-Learning). Most existing research on customization strategy focuses on a firm's marketing mix decisions, implicitly assuming away how the firm learns about customers. We contribute to this literature by examining how a firm's use of a specific learning approach impacts competition, particularly its rival's choice of learning approach. We find that O-Learning provides a credible signal for relaxing price competition, while S-Learning does not. Further, S-Learning by a firm creates a disincentive for rivals to also invest in S-Learning. We survey business customers and find significant evidence supporting our theory. We conclude with several managerial implications of our theory including how a firm can optimally select its learning strategy in order to impact its competitive environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Foster, JJ; Pitts, W				Foster, Jillian J.; Pitts, Wes			Implementation of an insulin therapy protocol: Applying the Baldrige approach	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH-SYSTEM PHARMACY			English	Article						Awards; Diabetes mellitus; Dosage; Hospitals; Insulin; Insulins; Methodology; Pharmacy, institutional, hospital; Protocols; Quality assurance; Team		Purpose. One quality initiative that North Mississippi Medical Center (NMMC) included in its application for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) is described. Summary. NMMC is a 650-bed, regional, nonprofit medical center that serves 22 counties in an area with approximately 600,000 people. The hospital received the MBNQA in 2006. NMMC's insulin performance-improvement team recognized a patient safety issue with the use of three insulin sliding scales that did not adequately meet the evidence-based standard of care for diabetes. The team developed a standard sliding-scale order set to enhance patient care and target blood glucose concentrations of 70-120 mg/dL. NMMC's quality initiatives aligned with the seven categories of the Baldrige Criteria for Organizational Performance Excellence-leadership; strategic planning; patient focus; measurement, analysis, and knowledge management; work-force focus; process management; and results. The insulin performance-improvement team included an endocrinologist, nursing staff, information technology staff, and a pharmacist. The goal of the insulin performance-improvement team was to develop a standard sliding insulin scale order set based on literature evidence, clinical knowledge, practitioner feedback, and information technology. The team considered the pharmacy department in the planning and implementation of the project, and pilot programs were conducted to best predict work-force issues. Inservice education was provided to nurses, pharmacists, and physicians over the course of several weeks. The team's attentiveness to time management created a seamless project. The three original sliding scales were discontinued, and the standard NMMC sliding scale was implemented on June 26, 2006. Because the Baldrige approach is versatile and flexible, it helped the insulin performance-improvement team at NMMC meet the challenging demands of health care. Conclusion. The Baldrige approach was successfully used to implement a standard insulin therapy protocol.

J	Sato, Y; Ata, S; Oka, I				Sato, Yasuhiro; Ata, Shingo; Oka, Ikuo			A Strategic Approach for Re-organizing the Internet Topology by Applying Social Behavior Dynamics	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Scale-free network; Networking strategy; Attack tolerance; Communication efficiency; Internet	SCALE-FREE NETWORKS	Recent studies have described the topologies of various networks including the Internet are categorized as scale-free networks. Scale-free network is extremely vulnerable to node attacks. However, the suitability of the topology of the Internet for communications has not been studied. We investigate whether the current Internet is optimized in both aspects of communication efficiency and attack tolerance. For this, we define three metrics to represent the capabilities of the network, which are Clustering coefficient, Efficiency, and Reachability. As a result, we found that the value of gamma, a scaling exponent in power law function representing the degree distribution of a scale-free network, may be reduced in the present Internet. To reduce the value of gamma, we propose four strategies for re-organizing a network. However, in real network, we cannot control the user's preference directly. We use a diffusion model based on social behavior dynamics. Furthermore, we show the characteristics of the re-organized networks, and discuss which strategy is more appropriate for achieving a desired network.

J	Bertomeu, J				Bertomeu, Jeremy			Endogenous shakeouts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION			English	Article						Shake-out; Sunk cost; Strategic uncertainty; Coordination	ENTRY; COMPETITION; MODEL; EXIT	Most new industries feature a shakeout, i.e. a short burst of entry soon followed by rapid exit of most early entrants. Yet, the speed, magnitude and timing of shakeouts are somewhat puzzling from the perspective of conventional entry models. In this paper, we argue that shakeouts are likely to occur as a result of the stochastic dynamics of the entry process, when firms are uncertain about their competitors' decision to enter. We show that the magnitude of such "endogenous" shakeouts can be quite large and sudden, in particular in highly competitive industries or markets with low-investment cost, low impatience and high liquidation values.

J	Hayashi, A; Ishii, N; Matsui, M				Hayashi, Akihiko; Ishii, Nobuaki; Matsui, Masayuki			A Theory and Tools for Collaborative Demand-to-Supply Management in the SCM Age	OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						collaborative demand-to-supply management; aggregate planning; strategic map; production scheduler; sustainable company; progressive analysis		In recent years, collaborative demand-to-supply management, which strategically supplies products to the market in order to maximize profit, has played a critical role in establishing a sustainable company. However, the sales function and the production function do not always work together for profit optimization. In most cases, the sales function is responsible for maximizing sales. On the other hand, the production function is responsible for minimizing production cost. In the SCM age, this situation causes production of excess inventory as well as long order fulfillment time. For the collaboration of both functions, a strategic demand-to supply map has been developed. The strategic map consists of a row and a column indicating the demand speed and the smoothing factor for demand forecasting. This paper presents a theory and a planning tool, called the planner, for collaborative demand-to-supply management based on the strategic map. The planner consists of demand forecasting, aggregate planning, the strategic map, the scheduler, and progressive analysis. The effectiveness of the planner is demonstrated with a numerical example. In addition, this paper shows that the planner is a useful tool for staff in the sales department and the production department for training or understanding collaborative demand-to-supply management. This paper also presents the potential areas of future research and development of collaborative demand-to-supply management and the planner.

The In Vivo Diagnosis of Early-Stage Aortic Valve Sclerosis Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in a Rabbit Model	JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						Aortic valve sclerosis; magnetic resonance imaging; hypercholesterolemia; animal model	PLASMA-CHOLESTEROL LEVELS; DOPPLER-ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; STENOSIS; ATHEROSCLEROSIS; DISEASE; AREA; QUANTIFICATION; CALCIFICATION; PATHOGENESIS	Purpose: To use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify and monitor early aortic valve sclerosis (AVS) induced by cholesterol feeding in rabbits. AVS is a highly prevalent disease process, affecting more than 25% of the population over age 65. A major obstacle to early stage medical management of AVS has been the lack of an objective noninvasive technique to identify Its presence and monitor its progress. Materials and Methods: Retrospectively gated CINE fast spoiled gradient echo (fSPGR) images of aortic valve cusps were collected at 3-month Intervals starting at 6 months using a 1.5 T MR scanner Interfaced with a customized surface radiofrequency coil. At 16 months a subset of animals was sacrificed and excised cusps were examine wit both high frequency ultrasound (US) and histopathological techniques to validate the MRI method. Results: MR and US analysis identified significant thickening of diseased AV cusps when compared to control (P < 0.05). Histopathological analysis confirmed the presence of human-like AVS In diseased rabbit valves. Conclusion: Early AVS, exemplified by increased valve thickness, can be identified in vivo using high-resolution MRI.

J	Fulford, H; Rizzo, A				Fulford, Heather; Rizzo, Alex			A CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR THE STRATEGIC ORIENTATION OF SMALL FIRMS	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING CULTURE			English	Article						Strategic orientation; strategic behaviour; entrepreneurial orientation; small firms	ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION; SMALL BUSINESS; ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; CONTINGENCY; ENVIRONMENT; CONSTRUCT; BEHAVIOR; CONTEXT	The study of patterns of small firm strategic behavior, or strategic orientation, is gradually gaining prominence in the literature. Strategic behavior is a consequence of various antecedents, such as the prevalent management philosophy and environmental dynamism. It, in turn, determines the particular engineering stance adopted, structures and processes deployed, and ultimately, organizational performance. The purpose of this paper is to critique, enhance and extend a model proposed by Aloulou and Fayolle (2005) that is focused particularly on the entrepreneurial orientation of small firms. A model is proposed for small firm strategic orientation that is based on a configurational approach, and applies the concepts of the adaptive cycle and the firm's lifecycle. The rationale for, and the various dimensions of the proposed model are described, and recommendations made for future research on small firm strategic behavior.

J	Zepke, N				Zepke, Nick			Thinking strategically in response to New Zealand's tertiary education strategy: The case of a Wananga	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & ORGANIZATION			English	Article						Strategic thinking; New Zealand government education policy; Tertiary education; Maori focused provision		This paper describes commissioned research on how a Wananga, a Maori focused post school institution in New Zealand, perceived its strategic options following the publication of the Labour-led governments Tertiary Education Strategy 2007-2012 and the Statement of Education Priorities 2008-10 (Ministry of Education 2006). The research used a Delphi panel process that looks for consensus answers to specific research questions: How should the Wananga respond to the policies sketched in the Tertiary Education Strategy and the Statement of Education Priorities? What is the range of issues that may need to be addressed as a result of this new policy framework? What options does the Wananga have in addressing these issues? The Delphi process enabled a clear set of priorities to be established: provide quality teaching and learning reflecting Maori values and practices; develop a consistent internal philosophy based on tikanga and ahuatanga Maori; and provide second chance education for Maori and other learners.

J	Kim, WS; Lee, M; Kim, KD				Kim, Whan-Seon; Lee, Myeongho; Kim, Kyung-Don			Strategic Differentiation of Internationalization in the Mobile Telecommunications Industry: Case Studies	ETRI JOURNAL			English	Article						Mobile network operator; internationalization strategy; equity participation; management control	ALLIANCES; EUROPE	We present a unified explanation of the internationalization strategies of major mobile network operators (MNOs). We have developed a framework that analyzes the strategies of major international MNOs in terms of the relationship between their degree of involvement in international business operations and the degree of equity participation. The results show a positive association between these two dimensions as expected, but they also reveal some exceptional cases in which certain MNOs are actively involved in the business operations of other foreign MNOs, even with minor (or zero) equity investments. In this paper, we argue that the strategic actions of the major MNOs which are the largest shareholders of foreign MNOs are in an equilibrium status because these major MNOs derive maximum benefit from full or considerable management control and active involvement. Finally, we predict that latecomers (MNOs who are just about to enter foreign telecommunications markets) may adopt an incremental investment approach because most developed markets and deregulated emerging markets with growth potential are already preempted by major MNOs.

J	Brent, AC; Wise, R; Fortuin, H				Brent, Alan C.; Wise, Russell; Fortuin, Henri			The viability of the South African biofuels industrial strategy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION			English	Article						bioenergy; renewable energy; national strategies; South Africa		South Africa aims to replace 2% of its total liquid transportation fuels in the short term through a newly introduced biofuels industrial strategy. It is envisaged that this target is achievable without excessive economic support by utilising surplus agricultural capacity. The target is based on local production, both agricultural and manufacturing, to provide the benefits of employment, economic growth and black economic empowerment through the value chain. This paper reviews the viability of the strategy in terms of the following three main conditions of sustainability, i.e. environmental, social and economic macro-forces. Further research requirements are identified to address uncertainties and improve policy and decision making, pertaining to the management of a viable biofuels sector in South Africa. The recommendations for further research are categorised into the six focus areas of life-cycle analyses, strategic assessments, farming practices, economic incentives, adaptive management and technology management.

J	Burger, E; Saayman, M				Burger, Elizna; Saayman, Melville			KEY SUCCESS FACTORS IN MANAGING A CONFERENCE CENTRE IN SOUTH AFRICA	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN SPORT PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND RECREATION			English	Article						Key success factors; KSFs; Conference centre; Strategic management; Factor analysis		The purpose of this paper was to identify the key success factors (KSFs) in managing a conference centre. South Africa has experienced a significant increase in international tourist arrivals as well as an increase in domestic travel. One of the reasons for the increase is because of business travel of which the so-called MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) sector is an important component. In order for the country to reap the benefits specifically of conference tourism, literature showed that quality management is of paramount importance. Identifying the KSFs will assist conference managers to focus on the most important aspects of managing a conference centre. In order to achieve this, 170 questionnaires were distributed via e-mail or were handed out personally to the membership of a conference venues database. Some 100 questionnaires were received back Responses to the questionnaire were subjected to a factor analysis in order to identify the key success factors in managing a conference centre. Six factors were identified that showed some similarities to similar research conducted in other sectors of the tourism industry, although differing somewhat. The six factors were activities and layout, marketing, operational aspects, planning, design and evaluation and human resources. The value of this research is twofold; firstly this research has never been undertaken in the conference sector in South Africa and secondly, the research confirmed two key success factors found in similar studies conducted in the tourism industry namely, well-trained human resources, and layout and accessibility of facilities. This research thus has implications for the curricula of tertiary institutions offering event and conference tourism. The results also showed that well-trained staff are important, as are the lay-out of facilities for the latter should be based on needs of conference organisers and attendees. Hence, for South Africa fully to benefit from a growing market, these KSFs can contribute to a high quality conference experience.

J	Coughlan, P; Coghlan, D				Coughlan, Paul; Coghlan, David			Reconciling market requirements and operations resources: an opportunity for action learning	ACTION LEARNING			English	Article						operations strategy; extended manufacturing enterprise; network learning; action learning		This article brings together the fields of action learning and operations strategy. It presents a case of action learning focused on strategic operations improvement in the extended manufacturing enterprise. As the third article in the set of explorations in this journal within the fields of action learning, operations strategy and collaborative improvement, it steps inside an inter-organisational action learning programme and exploits an operations strategy perspective on the improvement process and outcome. Through distinguishing between puzzles and problems, the article extends the scope of the operations improvement cycle and illustrates how the action learning approach can accommodate and enable engagement with the issues in potentially insightful practical and theoretical ways.

J	Monteiro, SMD; Guzman, BA				da Silva Monteiro, Sonia Maria; Aibar Guzman, Beatriz			Determining factors of environmental strategic positioning adopted by Portuguese large companies	SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL			English	Article						Environmental management; Portugal; Corporate strategy; Large enterprises		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the environmental strategic positioning adopted by a sample of large companies operating in Portugal and to identify the main factors which may have significant influence on the adoption of an environmental proactive strategy by a firm. Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected by sending a postal questionnaire. The paper considers three firm-specific characteristics which can be associated with the adoption of an environmental proactive positioning: size; industry membership; and type of control of the company's capital. Findings - The results indicate that there is a positive association between the existence in companies of an environmental department or division and the adoption of an environmental proactive positioning by these companies. However, there is not a significant relationship between adoption of an environmental proactive positioning and three firm-specific characteristics (industry membership, type of control of company's capital and size). Research limitations/implications - The sample only focuses on large firms operating in Portugal which belong to environmentally sensitive industries. In consequence, the conclusions cannot be extrapolated to all the Portuguese market. With regard to the method used to gather the data, the authors are aware that questionnaires have some limitations related to subjective interpretation of answers. Originality/value - The paper adds to the international data on environmental strategic positioning by providing what may well be a first glance into Portuguese situations for English-language speakers.

J	Delerue, H; Perez, M				Delerue, Helene; Perez, Marie			Unilateral commitment in alliances: an optional behaviour	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Strategic alliances; Risk management; Biotechnology; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Europe	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; TRANSACTION COST; REAL-OPTIONS; TRUST; INVESTMENTS; TECHNOLOGY; JAPANESE; RISK; CONSEQUENCES; OPPORTUNISM	Purpose - The coordination difficulties and risks inherent to business conduct are magnified in alliance relationships, posing a greater challenge for partners. The purpose of this paper is to propose real option perspective to examine how relational risk perceptions shape commitment behaviour in biotechnology alliance relationships. Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses are tested with survey data on 344 alliance relationships of European Biotechnology small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Findings - This paper suggests that commitment can be seen as a real option, which reduces the degree of asymmetry of information concerning a partner's behaviour. The findings stress that endogenous uncertainty makes unilateral commitment more attractive, but the conclusion does not show that it enhance perceived relationship effectiveness for the party that unilaterally commits in a unique time period. Research limitations/implications - Nevertheless, within this paper the real options logic to alliance commitments was applied to single dyadic relationships given the alliances were considered an optional context. It would be worthwhile to insert the unilateral commitment decisions for one alliance in the overall portfolio of potential future opportunities. Practical implications - From a managerial point-of-view, this paper shows that unilateral commitments can be seen as the expression of an optional behaviour. These commitments will not benefit the organization in the short term. Managers should adopt a holistic approach and consider all aspects of this problem. Originality/value - This paper tests a model of unilateral commitment and provides empirical evidence to explain some managerial behaviors.

J	Drummond-Hay, R; Bamford, D				Drummond-Hay, Robin; Bamford, David			A case study into planning and change management within the UK National Health Service	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public administration; Strategic change; National Health Service; United Kingdom		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present an empirical case study which was undertaken to examine planning and change management within a UK National Health Service (NHS) multi-site hospital. Design/methodology/approach - A case study was undertaken within a UK-based NHS hospital trust. Having reviewed the available literature, the research collated and analysed existing planning and change implementation within the hospital using multiple collection methods. This culminated in specific recommendations. Findings - It was established that the following were all factors of influence: articulating change in the NHS; preparing for the 18-week patient pathway; choose and book: managing patient demand; and payment by results: financial accountability at all levels. These were all high profile issues requiring specific and immediate attention, if the proposed plans and changes were to be implemented according to the objectives set. Research limitations/implications - The case study methodology applied was appropriate, generating data to facilitate discussion and to draw specific conclusions. A perceived limitation is the single case approach; however, Remenyi et al. argue that this can be enough to add to the body of knowledge. Practical implications - From the research, a number of key influences were identified to have a significant impact on planning and managing change within the NHS. Specific recommendations are made. Originality/value - The core contribution of the research adds to the body of knowledge about planning and the management of organisational change within healthcare.

The study centred on the management and staff of the case study airport and experts in the field of facilities management and aviation. The methodology for this study is a case study of three Scottish airports, owned and operated by the BAA Scotland (Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen international airports). Data was collected from Civil Aviation Agency, analysed and presented in the study. The study developed a three 'AAA' model (Airport - Aircraft - Airport) and a 3 stage approach to the research process. Evidence in this paper supports the conclusion that planning for airport safety and security are airport specific because no two airports are exactly the same, they differ in their; sizes, mode of operations, passenger type and flight destinations.

J	French, S				French, Steven			The reflective frame	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Action research; Strategic planning; Management styles; Small enterprises; Organizational culture; Empowerment		Purpose - To implement the concepts developed in this action research (AR) programme in a single company and monitor the results. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper the ideas canvassed in earlier papers regarding the inductive frame and the deductive frame are applied to a single firm and the response is observed over a period of three years. The CMS concept of a change in management style - from a modernist, traditional hands-on, hierarchical manager/subordinate style, to a more inclusive, self-management style is introduced Findings - The tangible benefits that have been observed in the subject company over a period of three years are described. The strategic thinking process led to a change in company culture, which has resulted in many benefits deriving from significant productivity gains. Financial performance and employee productivity have improved significantly. AR as a philosophy for change and CMS as an epistemological paradigm, which underlies the core philosophies for the business, are now part of the long-term culture of the firm and it is expected that the AR process will continue indefinitely. Practical implications - Significant improvements in productivity and profitability have been observed. Sickness and accident leave have also been reduced and a positive culture of self-responsibility is apparent.

J	Gans, HJ				Gans, Herbert J.			Working in Six Research Areas: A Multi-Field Sociological Career	ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY	Annual Review of Sociology		English	Article; Book Chapter						urban sociology; public policy; ethnicity; mass media; democracy; public sociology	AMERICAN-JEWRY; FUTURE	I have written a strictly autobiographical essay about the half dozen areas or fields in which I have done sociological research during my career. One reason for writing the essay is to encourage students to become what I call a "multi," there being too few in sociology, as in other disciplines in which most researchers do their work in one field. I hope the essay demonstrates that working in many fields can make for a satisfying and productive career. Research across areas also encourages comparative work, and if enough young people become mufti-field researchers, sociologists might then develop more interdisciplinary skills, which is even now desirable and may one day be necessary for all the social sciences. My essay also describes how and why I became interested in my six fields and how I moved between them during my career. The rest of the paper describes my major studies and other activities in my fields as well as the institutional and other contexts that I believe have affected my work.

J	Godinho, M; Fernandes, FCF				Godinho Filho, Moacir; Faria Fernandes, Flavio Cesar			Strategic Paradigms for Manufacturing Management (Spmm): Key Elements and Conceptual Model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING-THEORY APPLICATIONS AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Strategic Manufacturing; Management Paradigms; Mass Manufacturing; Lean Manufacturing; Responsive Manufacturing; Mass Customisation; Agile Manufacturing	TRADE-OFFS; FLEXIBILITY; INDUSTRY	This paper proposes a new concept in Manufacturing Management: Strategic Paradigm for Manufacturing Management (SPMM). This new concept aims to deal with the 20th century manufacturing management paradigms in a comparative and integrated way. To accomplish this goal four key elements are identified: drivers (market conditions that require SPMM implementation); performance objectives (representing the operation's strategic objectives that each SPMM gives priority to); principles (the SPMM fundamentals) and enablers (the tools, technologies and methods of each SPMM). The main contributions of this paper are: i) the presentation of a conceptual model that relates the SPMM to operation's strategic objectives; and, ii) the possibility of allowing comparisons and analyses of the manufacturing paradigms, facilitating the study and practical application of these paradigms. The proposed model deals with strategic questions in the Production/Operations Management context in a very pragmatic way. To illustrate the proposed model five case examples are presented.

J	Joshi, R; Dangayach, GS				Joshi, Rohit; Dangayach, G. S.			Activity-based costing as a tool for gaining competitive advantage: a case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						activity; activity cost; cost objective; cost driver		In today's competitive market, raising the prices or functionally executed cost cutting may not be a good option, as this may lead to reduction of market share or a risk of deteriorating the service quality, respectively. Another better prospect is to abandon unprofitable products, service lines, channel or customers, but these actions first require the ability to properly and accurately measure cost to determine true profit margins. Measuring the revenues is not a problem, but measuring the cost is. Traditional costing systems tend to distort product costs and lead to poor strategic decision making. Activity-Based Costing (ABC) is designed to deal with these limitations associated with traditional cost reporting systems. This paper presents findings of a longitudinal study, carried out in a leading automotive filter-manufacturing unit in India, where the concepts of ABC were utilised. The study was carried out at the works of the vendors supplying components. The result obtained reflects that the existing system is not uniform and no systematic method has been adopted in arriving at the different rates.

J	Kase, R; Zupan, N				Kase, Robert; Zupan, Nada			Human capital and structural position in knowledge networks as determinants when classifying employee groups for strategic human resource management purposes	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategic human resource management; social network analysis; human capital; social capital; knowledge networks; structural position	PERFORMANCE; ARCHITECTURE	Until recently, most theoretical models and empirical investigations in the strategic HRM field focused on inter-firm rather than intra-firm variability and thus implicitly assumed the adoption of the same HR practices (bundles) for managing all employee groups in a frill. Existing classifications of employees for strategic HRM purposes are mostly based on human capital and the employment mode. Through the lens of the knowledge-based view of the firm, we examine the ways in which an individual employee is valuable to a firm and suggest that an individual's structural position in knowledge networks should also be considered. By conducting a social network analysis of an SME, we establish that studying an individual's relationship-based characteristics (i.e. an individual's structural position in knowledge networks) strengthens the reasoning for employee classification and should thus be considered for strategic HRM purposes.

J	Klimesova, D; Brozova, H				Klimesova, D.; Brozova, H.			DSS AND GIS IN KNOWLEDGE TRANSFORMATION PROCESS	JOURNAL ON EFFICIENCY AND RESPONSIBILITY IN EDUCATION AND SCIENCE			English	Article						Tacit and explicit knowledge; SECT model; Operations Research and Management Science Models; Decision Support Systems; Geographical Information Systems; Models		Knowledge is an important resource for successful decision-making process in the whole society today. The special procedures of control and management of knowledge therefore have to be used. In the area of knowledge management and knowledge engineering basic terms of these disciplines are data, information, knowledge and knowledge transformation. The knowledge can be defined as a dynamic human process of justifying personal beliefs. Knowledge is a product of successful decision-making process. Knowledge transformation is a spiralling process of interactions between explicit and tacit knowledge that leads to the new knowledge. Nonaka and al (2000) show, that the combination of these two categories makes possible to conceptualise four conversion steps: Socialisation, Externalisation, Combination and Internalisation (SECT model). Another model of knowledge creation is the Knowledge Transformation Continuum (BCI Knowledge Group) that begins with the articulation of a specific instruction representing the best way that a specific task, or series of tasks, should be performed. Knowledge modelling and knowledge representation is an important field of research also in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. The definition of knowledge in Artificial Intelligence is a noticeable different, because Artificial intelligence is typically dealing with formalized knowledge (e.g. ontology). The development of knowledge-based systems was seen as a process of transferring human knowledge to an implemented knowledge base. Decision Support Systems (DSS), Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Operations Research/Management Science (OR/MS) modelling process support decision-making process, therefore they also produce a new knowledge. A Decision Support Systems are an interactive computer-based systems helping decision makers complete decision process. Geographic Information Systems provide essential marketing and customer intelligence solutions that lead to better business decisions. Operational Research and Management Science (OR/MS) is methodology based on system theory and theory of modelling. The OR/MS models serve for better quantification and precision of decision-making process. In this contribution the role of DSS, GIS and OR/MS models in the process of knowledge creation will be explained. The tacit or explicit character of this knowledge and the process of its creation will be explained and discussed.

J	Kolo, J				Kolo, Jerry			The knowledge economy: concept, global trends and strategic challenges for Africa in the quest for sustainable development	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Knowledge Management Regional Conference 2007	JUN 11-13, 2007	Cairo, EGYPT			Knowledge Economy; KE; tacit and explicit knowledge; knowledge economy pillars; Knowledge Index; KI; knowledge economy hurdles in Sub-Saharan Africa		This paper argues that Sub-Saharan Africa is a passive bystander in the global 'knowledge economy' race. In this race, success hinges on a county's capacity to develop and apply tacit knowledge to production systems, resulting in wealth creation and an enhanced quality of life. This race is currently led by four regions, called knowledge engines, namely, the European Union, East Asia, India and the USA. However, China Brazil and others are making quiet strides as contenders. Africa's quest to join the race is crippled by complex problems which, arguably, are best solved through the adoption of modern knowledge systems and tools. In this Catch-22 situation, Africa can join the race only through pragmatic regional and global initiatives and resources, which would assist the region to develop the capacity to acquire the knowledge needed to pursue sustainable development. The paper suggests initiatives to radically hasten Africa's pace in the knowledge economy race.

But this may be the wrong mantra. Instead of a largely static and linear heuristic, we suggest grounding theory and practice in what we introduce as Multiplex Theory and the Strategic Managing of Organizing to link the emergent lightning of complex multi-level nonlinear networks.

Survey data were collected from 245 persons from 88 knowledge intensive business Service firms. Regression analysis shown that strategic attention, culture, differentiation market and variation in demand have made positive effects on innovative dimensions in KIBS of the People's Republic of China. Oil the other hand, innovative behaviour of individual workers did not affect the innovative dimensions in KIBS of the People's Republic of China in a direct manner.

J	Lytras, MD; de Pablos, PO				Lytras, Miltiadis D.; Ordonez de Pablos, Patricia			Managing, measuring and reporting knowledge-based resources in hospitals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						healthcare industry; hospital; intellectual capital disclosure; knowledge-based resources; knowledge management; measurement	FIRM; INFORMATION; STRATEGY; SYSTEM; VIEW	The paper firstly analyses the importance of knowledge-based resources for the achievement of a competitive advantage for the firm. Additionally, the paper also addresses the strategic significance of this type of intangible resources in hospitals. Secondly, the paper argues that "what is measured is managed" and, therefore, proposes specific indicators to measure the different types of knowledge-based resources that exist in a hospital. Finally, the paper presents major conclusions and the implications for knowledge management.

J	Mandal, A; Thomas, H; Antunes, D				Mandal, Abhijit; Thomas, Howard; Antunes, Don			Dynamic linkages between mental models, resource constraints and differential performance A resource-based analysis	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Modelling; Cognition; Resources; Resource management; Business performance; Competitive strategy		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus around the literatures of the resource-based firm and cognitive mental models, explores the dynamic linkages between cognitive models, resources and firm performance in the context of the insurance industry. Design/methodology/approach - In a real-life example drawn from the insurance industry, a process-based simulation model is developed to explore the linkages between managerial mental models, resources and performance. It represents resources as endogenous flows and mental models and resource constraints as exogenous parameters. This allows, for example, the impact of heterogeneity in mental models, on such factors as the time path of resource allocations, resources and capabilities, and ultimately performance, to be studied in two firms (business units) in the insurance industry. Findings - In general, heterogeneity in mental models leads to differences in performance in the long run. This finding is reinforced by the presence of resource constraints. Facing strategic change, however, it is often difficult for senior managers to overcome the influence of well-established managerial mental models or recipes which create cognitive inertia and, in turn, hinder performance improvements. Originality/value - There are few empirical studies which explore the impact of changes in mental models and resource constraints on firm-performance and resource allocation decisions.

J	Othman, R; Rauf, FA				Othman, Radiah; Rauf, Fatimah			Implementing school performance index (SPIn) in Malaysian primary schools	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Primary schools; Students; Performance measures; Public schools; Malaysia		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the processes involved in implementing school performance index (SPIN) - a new key performance indicator - and the results of its application in Malaysian public schools. Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 76 Malaysian schools from five districts was selected randomly. The analytical procedures such as documentary analysis, observation and interviews with 101 headmasters and principals, Parents-Teachers Association representatives and brainstorming session with Schools Inspectors was used. Findings - Schools performed differently when evaluated using various criteria of their operational efficiency and effectiveness. The results show that schools, which have scored higher in examination results (test scores) do not necessarily perform in other categories. In fact, the overall SPIN scores indicated they are in the bottom list. Practical implications - SPIN can help authorities to better monitor the operational performance of the schools in providing quality education to future generations of Malaysians. Originality/value - In general, schools' performance is measured based on students' examination results (test scores). SPIN is introduced to propose that a school should be measured within its capability as different schools will have different capacity. It is argued that operational efficiency and effectiveness (by incorporating various elements such as leadership, measurement analysis and strategic planning), is a better measure on how the school performs.

The application of portfolio analysis to US hospital settings has been frequently reported. In Europe however, the application of this technique has received little attention, especially concerning public hospitals. Therefore, this paper examines the peculiarities of portfolio analysis and its applicability to the strategic management of European public hospitals. The analysis is based on a pilot application of a multi-factor portfolio analysis in a Dutch university hospital. The nature of portfolio analysis and the steps in a multi-factor portfolio analysis are reviewed along with the characteristics of the research setting. Based on these data, a multi-factor portfolio model is developed and operationalized. The portfolio model is applied in a pilot investigation to analyze the market attractiveness and hospital strengths with regard to the provision of three orthopedic services: knee surgery, hip surgery, and arthroscopy. The pilot portfolio analysis is discussed to draw conclusions about potential barriers to the overall adoption of portfolio analysis in the management of a public hospital.

Critical success factors in the development of strategic information systems in Indian public sector organisations: an inter-organisational analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						critical success factors; information technology; management levels; PSUs; public sector undertakings; SIS; strategic information systems		A rapidly changing business environment requires firms to develop information systems that are more flexible, responsive, integrative and information rich. At the same time, it is also important to align the information systems with their core business processes. Review of literature of this study indicated the clear gaps existing in the development of strategic information systems (SIS) in general and particular in the public sector undertakings (PSUs) in India. Thus, this study has been undertaken in Indian PSUs. Data has been collected from 164 managers who were working at different levels of management. Five critical success factors, namely, corporate planning; regular upkeep of the machinery; fire and safety audits; quality control; quality assurance have been found as critical success factors for the selected organisations. In particular and the other organisations in general based on the findings of the study, it is recommended that the organisations must take care of these critical success factors so as to develop SIS which are successful information system and thus enable the organisation to get a sustainable competitive advantage.

J	Ruckman, K				Ruckman, Karen			Technology sourcing acquisitions What they mean for innovation potential	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Pharmaceuticals industry; Acquisitions and mergers; Research and development; Innovation; United States of America	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; FIRMS; INTEGRATION; KNOWLEDGE; PRODUCTIVITY; CAPABILITIES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine what the effects of acquisition are on R&D patterns. Design/methodology/approach - This paper tests whether the actual post-acquisition R&D intensity of the combined firm deviated from the predicted R&D intensity, where the predicted amount is an asset-weighted average of pre-acquisition values. Findings - The results indicate that the combination of technology sourcing and technological relatedness have strong predictive powers for determining changes in post-acquisition R&D intensity. Technology sourcing acquisition of unrelated technologies results in an increase in post-acquisition R&D intensity, as predicted. Acquirers in this situation may be using their acquisition as a platform for research expansion. Research limitations/implications - The dataset used in this paper was restricted to public acquirers and targets for completeness of financial information. It would be useful to determine the extent to which a technology sourcing acquirer is predicted to enter into an acquisition and also whether technology sourcing can be used as a predictor for the ultimate target company out of a pool of potential targets. Practical implications - The results can be used to inform managers on a strategic level when research strategy deviates from what the theory would predict. For example, if a company that did a technology sourcing acquisition of an unrelated product subsequently decreased R&D intensity, then rival pharmaceutical firms can ascertain that the acquired research was ultimately determined to be too risky or unviable. Originality/value - The value in this paper is the unique measurement for technology sourcing.

J	Sager, B; Dowling, M				Sager, Bernadette; Dowling, Michael			Strategic marketing planning for opportunity exploitation in young entrepreneurial companies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURING			English	Article						strategic marketing planning; SMP; entrepreneurship; opportunity	DECISION-MAKING; PROCEDURAL RATIONALITY; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; SMALL FIRMS; GROWTH; COMPREHENSIVENESS; DETERMINANTS; ORGANIZATION; ANTECEDENTS; MANAGERS	Both entrepreneurship and marketing theory and practice are opportunity driven. To exploit opportunities, entrepreneurial companies need to apply so-called professional management instruments, such as strategic marketing planning (SMP). SMP seems to be especially important for young companies in growth industries market. However, research has not addressed whether entrepreneurial companies use SMP, under what conditions and with what effect on performance. In this study we identified and tested antecedents of SMP in young companies in Germany. In our model, we developed a multidimensional model of SMP and tested a series of hypotheses using data gathered from 157 entrepreneurial companies. We found out that environmental uncertainty, external capital and managerial experience and, to some extent, top management team size and intentions to change are linked positively to the use of SMP in such firms.

J	Subramoniam, S; Tounsi, M				Subramoniam, Suresh; Tounsi, Mohamed			An object oriented intelligent environment for ERP systems	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Object-oriented databases; Artificial intelligence; Object-oriented languages; Manufacturing resource planning		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate object-oriented (OO) features in a language, suitable for artificial intelligence (AI), which will execute in a web environment. Earlier researchers have claimed that such a possibility will pave the way for better enterprise systems of tomorrow. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, the key OO features, inheritance and polymorphism, are presented using suitable examples. Visual Prologe is the language used to demonstrate the examples and the same executes in web environment. Findings - This premise definitely matches the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of existing systems which can aptly be called business process reengineering (BPR) in this field of study. A monolithic/homogeneous expert database design based system supporting AI and OO capabilities which executes in web environment is the result of this study. Research limitations/implications - There is no argument about the optimality of the search which is carried out while using this environment, which is purely based on the computer language used. Practical implications - The power of similar environment has enormous potential in developing better enterprise systems of tomorrow. This declarative environment helps enterprise resource planning (ERP) evolve faster towards strategic decision making rather than remaining as transaction processing systems. Originality/value - It is hoped that this paper will inspire other researchers in the field of BPR of existing ERP systems.

J	Swoboda, B; Foscht, T; Maloles, C; Schramm-Klein, H				Swoboda, Bernhard; Foscht, Thomas; Maloles, Cesar, III; Schramm-Klein, Hanna			Exploring how garment firms choose international sourcingand sales-country markets	JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						International marketing; Strategic choices; Sourcing; Fashion industry		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how firms that do both sourcing and selling choose which countries to source from and to which countries to sell. It also looked at the role of competitive strategy, vertical integration, and foreign involvement in the decision-making. Design/methodology/approach - A survey instrument that was designed based on personal interviews with 20 German garment industry executives was administered to 750 German, Austrian and Swiss garment manufacturers. In total, 93 questionnaires were usable. Factor analysis was employed in evaluating the data. Findings - The results indicate that firms that both source and sell at the same time have more complex decision making than normative models suggest. These decisions tend not to be isolated decisions. The factors that are considered in sourcing are different in the decision as to where to sell. Foreign involvement, competitive strategy, and vertical integration influence the firms' decision making. Research limitations/implications - The study is exploratory in nature and it is limited in its application. Moreover, the disproportionately large number of German respondents may skew the results. In addition, the total number of respondents is relatively small. The study may also suffer from any or all of the following deficiencies: lack of reliability and validity test, having only one executive per firm respond to the survey, not considering country-specific characteristics, and lack of control for the market-entry strategy and market size variables. Originality/value - Most research in this area focuses on either the sourcing or the selling side. This study looks at how sourcing and selling decisions are made by firms engaged in both activities. Additionally, the roles of competitive strategy, vertical integration, and foreign involvement in relation to the decision making are investigated.

J	Trappey, CV; Trappey, AJC; Chiang, TA; Kuo, JY				Trappey, Charles V.; Trappey, Amy J. C.; Chiang, Tzu-An; Kuo, Jen-Yau			A strategic product portfolio management methodology considering R&D resource constraints for engineering-to-order industries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product portfolio management; PPM; product life cycle management; R&D resources; multiattribute decision analysis	DEVELOPMENT PROJECT SELECTION; DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM	New product development Projects Usually incur high cost and high risk for corporations. For engineering-to-order industries, where each order requires a certain degree of new product design and customisation, R&D resources must be properly utilised for the highest possible profits. Thus, Engineering-To-Order firms often search for optimal product portfolios that effectively allocate limited enterprise resources to projects with the greatest potential for success. This paper develops a Product Portfolio Management (PPM) methodology that systematically analyses product portfolio strategies at the beginning of the product life cycle. Multiattribute decision analysis estimates the performance values used to construct plausible product portfolios during the early Engineering-To-Order design stage. An activity group concept evaluates resource requirements and the potential risks of product portfolios. The revenue of a product portfolio considers the levels Of Substitution among products. Finally, an industrial computer manufacturer, that is, a typical Engineering-To-Order company, adopts the methodology for its PPM to demonstrate the practical application of the research.

J	Waite, P; Williams, P				Waite, Phillip; Williams, Paul			Collaboration or opportunism? The role of social capital in developing successful export clustersl	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						exporting; industry clusters; SMEs; social capital		This paper reports on an exploratory study into social capital and its influence on the development of horizontal export-focused industry clusters for small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). The paper contends that higher levels of social capital within firms can be externalized to other firms in industry clusters, and this makes the cluster more effective in international markets. The study assessed the levels of social capital evident within nine individual SMEs based in South East Queensland, Australia, across three different industry clusters. The study evaluated attitudes of the firm towards its other cluster members and found that higher levels of social capital within individual SMEs, was being externalized to their industry cluster, and this helped the firms to develop long-term relationships, develop common objectives and improve levels of trust among members. Higher levels of exposure in international markets, was evident in such firms in the cluster.

J	Yahuda, M				Yahuda, Michael			Sino-Japanese relations: partners and rivals?	KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS			English	Article								This article examines some of the stresses and strains underlying the development of the current partnership between China and Japan. It shows that the disputes that emerged after the end of the Cold War about the history of Japanese aggression against China (1931-45) that adversely affected relations between the two were less about history as such than about problems of identity within each country and between both countries. It further argues that despite their deepening economic interdependence, it was structural factors that created tension and rivalry between these two great powers of Asia. It was only the coincidence of domestic political changes in both China and Japan in 2006 that provided the opportunity for the new leaders in each country to break the ice between them. Since then it has required purposive and careful management by both sets of leaders to mitigate the divisive tendencies that could once again thrust the relationship into a descending spiral. Finally, it will be argued that the American role of having provided the strategic stability and the public goods, which have made it possible for first Japan and then China to achieve extraordinary rates of economic growth, is coming under stress. Skillful diplomacy will be needed if the United States is to be able to continue to maintain strategic stability through the alliance with Japan and engagement with China.

J	Hocevar, B; Jaklic, J				Hocevar, Borut; Jaklic, Jurij			ASSESSING BENEFITS OF BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS - A CASE STUDY	MANAGEMENT-JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY MANAGEMENT ISSUES			English	Article								Several arguments can be found in business intelligence literature that the use of business intelligence systems can bring multiple benefits, for example, via faster and easier access to information, savings in information technology ('IT') and greater customer satisfaction all the way through to the improved competitiveness of enterprises. Yet, most of these benefits are often very difficult to measure because of their indirect and delayed effects on business success. On top of the difficulties in justifying investments in information technology ('IT'), particularly business intelligence ('BI'), business executives generally want to know whether the investment is worth the money and if it can be economically justified. In looking for an answer to this question, various methods of evaluating investments can be employed. We can use the classic return on investment ('ROI') calculation, cost-benefit analysis, the net present value ('NPV') method, the internal rate of return ('IRR') and others. However, it often appears in business practice that the use of these methods alone is inappropriate, insufficient or unfeasible for evaluating an investment in business intelligence systems. Therefore, for this purpose, more appropriate methods are those based mainly on a qualitative approach, such as case studies, empirical analyses, user satisfaction analyses, and others that can be employed independently or can help us complete the whole picture in conjunction with the previously mentioned methods. Since there is no universal approach to the evaluation of an investment in information technology and business intelligence, it is necessary to approach each case in a different way based on the specific circumstances and purpose of the evaluation. This paper presents a case study in which the evaluation of an investment in on-line analytical processing ('OLAP') technology in the company Melamin was made through an analysis of users' opinions along with a strategic analysis based on identifying a cause-and-effect relationship between the benefits of OLAP technology and the company's strategic goals.

Stability in shifting sands: contemporary leadership roles in critical care	JOURNAL OF NURSING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						communication; critical care nursing; leadership; patient outcomes	ICU LIAISON NURSE; PATIENT MORTALITY; IMPACT; UNIT; OUTCOMES; EMPOWERMENT; ALERT(TM); DISCHARGE; ATTITUDES; OUTREACH	Background Contemporary nursing leadership roles in critical care are a reflection of the changing environment in which critical care is provided. Key issues In the UK, critical care nursing faces challenges in the form of: reduced number and seniority of medical staff cover for acute wards; mandated responsibility for management of patients outside of critical care units, without corresponding responsibility for managing staff; increased public and political awareness of deficits in critical care; increased use of Assistant Practitioners; and emphasis on longer-term outcomes from intensive care. Evaluation New leadership roles have met these challenges head on with two main foci: patient management across the acute/critical care interface and hospital wide policies and practice. Conclusions The leadership roles examined in this paper highlight three underpinning goals: improved quality and safety of patient care; improved communication between professionals; and empowerment of junior nurses and doctors. Implications for nursing management There has been considerable investment in strategic leadership roles for critical care nursing; evidence is developing of the return on this investment for patient and service outcomes. Consideration must now be given to the preparation, mentorship and development of leadership roles for the next generation of nurse leaders.

J	Jun, M; Cai, S; Kim, D				Jun, Minjoon; Cai, Shaohan; Kim, DaeSoo			The Strategic Implications of E-Network Integration and Transformation Paths for Synchronizing Supply Chains	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						e-network; information systems; supply chain management; technology-transaction integration; transformation strategies	E-HUBS; MANAGEMENT; ADOPTION; SUCCESS; IMPACT	Streamlining information flows across the physical supply chain is crucial for successful supply chain management. This study examines different structures of e-networks (i.e., virtual supply chains linked via electronic information and communication technologies) and their maximum capabilities to gain e-network benefits. Further, this research explores four levels of e-network integration based on a 2x2 e-network technology and transaction integration matrix. Of the four levels, an e-network with high e-technology/high e-transaction integration appears to be most desirable for the companies that aspire to achieve the maximum benefits from their IT investments. Finally, this study identifies three alternative transformation paths toward a powerful high e-technology/high e-transaction integration network and discusses strategic implications of selecting those paths, in terms of e-network structures, availability of financial and technical resources, supply chain members' collaborative planning, e-security mechanisms, and supply chain size.

The analysis is based on interview data from the Finnish magazine publishing industry. On the product level, the Internet is a means of differentiation, while on the company level firm-specific resources and capabilities determine how companies can react to the strategic changes on the product level. However, it seems that the Internet has not significantly changed the five forces that shape the nature and state of competition in the magazine publishing industry.

J	Fomin, VV				Fomin, Vladislav V.			Snow, buses, and mobile data services in the information age	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						mobile data services; mobile communications; uncertainty; improvisation; learning; consumer practices; interpretative case study; multi-method		This paper examines the situation of non-use of mobile data and voice services. The observed behavior is at odds with positivist socio-economic theories and commonsensical understanding of the possibilities brought about by the ubiquitous information and communications technology environment. Using a multi-method and theoretical framework designed to combine positivist and interpretative approaches, we attempt at developing new insights into the inter-related roles of ICT and consumer behavior in real-life situations. The findings challenge the commonsensical rhetoric on the advancement of Information Society and provide insights for the design of useful information and communication services.

J	Lynn, SG; Seethamraju, C; Seetharaman, A				Lynn, Stephen Gregory; Seethamraju, Chandra; Seetharaman, Ananth			Incremental Value Relevance of Unrecognized Deferred Taxes: Evidence from the United Kingdom	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN TAXATION ASSOCIATION			English	Article								We examine empirically whether the use of the partial method for deferred taxes provides incremental information of use to investors. Specifically, we test whether U.K. capital markets valued unrecognized deferred tax amounts reported in the footnotes to U.K. annual reports, pursuant to U.K. Statement of Standard Accounting Practice (SSAP) No. 15 (ASB 1985). Our empirical model is based on Feltham and Ohlson (1995). We run iterative weighted least-squares (IWLS) regression of year-end share prices on a decomposition of book value per share for a pooled sample of U.K. firm-years drawn from the years 1993 through 1998, and find positive associations with price for net deferred tax assetsboth recognized and unrecognized. Moreover, we are unable to reject the null hypothesis that both parts of deferred taxes have similar multiples in our price regressions. These findings support some theoretical predictions in Sansing (1998), Guenther and Sansing (2000, 2004), and Amir et al. (2001).

The results of a discourse analysis of 22 interviews with Finnish small business managers show three different approaches to strategy: (1) strategy as an emergent process of reactive problem solving, (2) strategy as a formal planning process, and (3) strategy as a shared process. The results can be used as a starting point in further research to study the impact of strategy on business growth and performance.

J	de Lima, EP; da Costa, SEG; Angelis, JJ				de Lima, Edson Pinheiro; Gouvea da Costa, Sergio Eduardo; Angelis, Jannis Jan			Framing Operations and Performance Strategic Management System Design Process	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						operations strategy; performance measurement; strategic management; system design		The increasing competitive pressure resulting from operations activities and market globalization are forcing enterprises to reorient their strategies, operations systems and processes. Specifically, organizations are paying closer attention to the changing nature of operations systems performance, to the point where operations strategic management system used in enterprise performance evaluation becomes the main focus of redesign projects. This study explores the process rationality behind operations strategy management systems design, taking into account a content definition established by a structural specification of the management system and the integration of life cycle and implementation models. This research proposes a framework that represents reconciliation between research and practice, contributing to the development and test of practical solutions for operations strategic management system design, implementation and management. The main result is a synthesis of three frameworks that each addresses the design process in different levels: the performance management system life cycle model; the process approach for guiding design and implementation issues; and recommendations that synthesizes the design task. The study also discusses methodological choices in approaching the design, implementation and use of an operations strategic management system. Doing so, the study develops the discussion on structural and process aspects of strategic performance measurement system design.

J	van de Rijt, A; van Assen, M				van de Rijt, Arnout; van Assen, Marcel			Theories of network exchange: Anomalies, desirable properties, and critical networks	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						exchange networks; bargaining; rational choice	POWER; MODEL; CORE	The present study evaluates four well-known theories of exchange in networks. In previous research these theories' predictions were compared for a small set of networks using experimental data. We compared their predictions for all 12,112 networks up to size 8. By comparing these predictions we (i) identified anomalies in theories of network exchange, (ii) investigated to what extent the theories satisfy basic principles of exchange, (iii) identified 'critical' networks for which predictions are very different. We conclude that exchange in networks is not yet well understood. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Relationship Between Leadership Capability and Knowledge Management: A Measurement Approach	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Leadership capability; core skills; emotional intelligence; strategic planning and execution; knowledge management; knowledge generation; knowledge sharing	SYSTEMS	The importance of leadership capability (LC) and knowledge management (KM) are well recognised in the popular and academic press to achieve competitive advantage. Although organisations are applying many skills and practices to address the problems for the achievement of competitive advantage, but unable to focus on the measurement and relationship aspects of LC and KM. Many organisations are succeeding and achieving their goals and targets generally with their human resource skills, and particularly with LC and KM. But there are no methodologies for their measurement aspects to plan for the required human resource with necessary competencies as per the desired organisational goals. A research is carried out to develop a methodology for the measurement and relationship aspects of the LC and KM. As the main purpose of this paper is to investigate a relationship between LC and KM, a research study is carried out in: (i) development of process models for LC and KM, (ii) developed an instrument for measuring the LC and KM efforts and (iii) investigated for the relationship between LC and KM. Based on the survey of 247 managers in the three major public sector undertakings, the LC and KM skills have been measured, and analysed for their relationship. The analysed data interprets that there is a positive correlation relationship between the LC and KM. Finally, this research limitations and implications have been examined.

JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN HEALTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Quality; Total quality management; Strategic management; Health care system		Background: Quality Management is one of the most effective strategies for improving the health systems performance in developed and developing countries. The main goal of this study was identifying the most important aspects of quality management and preparing an appropriate model for health system. Method: This research was a comparative study on quality management models in the health systems of different countries. We have selected, as a sample, different countries in Asia, Africa, North America, Europe, and South America having a background in using various samples of total quality models in their health units. The studies also included the experiences of World Health Organization in different countries. Results: The main goals for promoting quality in the countries are being studied includes service efficiency increase, promoting services delivery, promoting quality of working life, and changing organizational culture. Total approaches used for the countries studied include quality Assurance, Cultural change, ISO 9001, TQM and improving services quality. There are not generally outcomes criteria in 22 cases of the studies done in the developing countries. The most important problems revealed in establishing the quality management, organizational resistance against the change, lack of senior management commitments, lack of strategic planning and lack of required resources. Conclusion: The models for quality management should pay attention to the cultural change strategies, staff participation, strategic vision and Strategic planning. Strategic total quality management is the appropriate model in this regard.

With that aim, the phases which constitute the perception process are identified-the selection of stimuli and interpretation and the associated bias. Specifically, we identify two: bias by omission and bias by imprecise meaning.

J	Teweldemedhin, MY				Teweldemedhin, M. Y.			The fish industry in Eritrea: from comparative to competitive advantage	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						supply chain management; comparative advantage; competitiveness and porter analysis		The paper examines the main constrains in stimulating extent of production driven supply chains, that could able to transform into market driven supply chain management.; Questionnaires, were developed and administered to marketing agents using purposive sampling, with the application of Porter's diamond of national competitive advantage. Red sea being underexploited resource; and it is unique opportunity for the development of the country (MOF, 1997). However, this comparative advantage has never been converted to competitive advantage. Comparing to the percentage of fish population with in 100km from the coastal, Eritrea has the larger fish resource concentration in the region ( 73%). However, the sector has never made significant contribution to the country food security. The study confirms that all the role payers in the fish market chain and policy makers need to take a strategic approach, in identifying target markets, and ways to build strong and sustainable production. Moreover, all stack holder in the sector needs to formulate how to move up to: the value chain; niche marketing opportunity; converting comparative into competitive advantage; specifically focus on the services revolution; and overcoming technical and structural barriers.				tmogos@polytechnic.edu.na					Amin A, 1999, INT J URBAN REGIONAL, V23, P365, DOI 10.1111/1468-2427.00201; COLLINS R, 1999, AEASA C CLUB MYK LAN; *FAM HLTH INT, 2006, ER; *FAO, 1997, 97004ADBERI FAO; FAO, 2000, STAT WORLD FISH AQ; Hahn MH, 1999, J OPER RES SOC, V50, P451, DOI 10.2307/3009994; HANDFIELD RB, 1996, INTRO SUPPLY CHAIN M, P162; LEEDY P, 2000, RES PLANNING DESIGN; Lupin HM, 1999, FOOD CONTROL, V10, P267, DOI 10.1016/S0956-7135(99)00054-7; *MOF, 2003, FISH RES REG SERV DE; *MOF, 1997, POL STRAT PROGR; *MOF, 2000, EX SUMM MIN FISH REP; *MOF, 2001, EX SUMM MIN FISH REP; *MOF, 2002, FISH RES MAN DEP ANN; MUIR JF, 2001, INT C SUST CONTR FIS; NEGASH T, 2003, RED SEA HOPE DEV PRO; POIRIER CC, 1999, NEWS PAPER, V12, P219; PORTER ME, 1990, COMPETITIVE ADVANTAG, P260; REYNOLDS JE, 1993, FIFAOTCPERT2251; SCOVAZZI T, 1992, SECTOR STUDIES FAO, V1; Tom Titenberg, 2000, ENV NATURAL RESOURCE; van der Vorst JGAJ, 2000, EUR J OPER RES, V122, P354, DOI 10.1016/S0377-2217(99)00238-6; Wessells C.

J	Durkin, M; O'Donnell, A; Crowe, J				Durkin, Mark; O'Donnell, Aodheen; Crowe, Joe			Relationship disconnect in retail banking	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETING			English	Article						relationships; disconnection; remote; SST; banking; marketing	SELF-SERVICE; TECHNOLOGY	It has been established that increasing the role of technology in a service organisation can serve to reduce costs and improve service reliability. It is argued, however, that there remains an important role for personalised relationships in the delivery of any service proposition. Throughout this paper both of these perspectives will be discussed and an attempt is made to reconcile these apparently opposing views in the emerging age of technology-enabled remote relationships. Findings from a longitudinal research study with a large UK case bank that focused on the area of remote relationships are revisited and reinterpreted with management from the case bank in question. Through this reflective lens the bank's recent strategic decision to no longer proactively relationship manage its personal customer base is examined. In light of this deliberate relationship disconnection strategy key marketing implications are discussed.

J	Badir, YF; Buchel, B; Tucci, C				Badir, Yuosre F.; Buechel, Bettina; Tucci, Christopher			The role of communication and coordination between 'network lead companies' and their strategic partners in determining NPD project performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						communication; coordination; high-tech projects performance; networks and strategic alliances; new product development	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; ORGANIZATIONAL INTEGRATION; GROUP COHESIVENESS; MODEL; BEHAVIOR; SUCCESS; IMPACT; FLOWS; TEAMS	Using the data collected from three in-depth case studies of high-tech New Product Development (NPD) projects conducted by network lead companies from different industries with alliance partners, we attempt to extend and merge the knowledge of NPD management, communication and coordination theory, and inter-organisation theory by proposing a contingency model. We propose that under conditions of fit between contextual factors that characterise high-tech NPD projects and the intensity level of communication and coordination, NPD project performance is highest. The model indicates that NPD project performance is contingent on the fit between the actual intensity level Of communication and coordination - between the network lead company and its project's strategic partners - and the required intensity level.

The purpose is often of strategic character and these cooperation forms are hence long-term. These cooperation concepts are striving for continuous improvements in regard of both delivering more value to the client and removing waste in the supply chain. The experiences so far reveal that cost reduction up to 50% and reduction of lead time up to 80% is possible. This could set new standards for the construction industry and raise productivity.

J	Bouncken, RB; Lekse, WJ; Koch, M				Bouncken, Ricarda B.; Lekse, William J.; Koch, Michael			Project Management Capabilities in the New Media Industry	JOURNAL OF MEDIA BUSINESS STUDIES			English	Article						new media; project networks; alliance projects		The new media industry is made up of dynamic and perilous markets, in which a firm's success is dependent on the continuous rapid development of innovative products. To achieve this daunting task firms establish and maintain networks of potential partners that have capabilities with high potential and serious risks. These networks of partners are repositories of diverse resources to supplement and complement lacking internal resources. The authors conducted in-depth exploratory interviews with executives of small and medium sized new media firms following their participation in joint innovative product development projects. The authors develop propositions extending resource-based view theory to the development of resources across weak ties while highlighting the tactical and strategic management of new product projects within project networks. They uncovered complex processes and performance constructs giving future researchers more specificity in their future project alliance research models.

Wey; Lin, Binshan			KMsharer: an information technology approach to enable knowledge management services	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						architecture; knowledge management; knowledge management systems; strategic information systems; XML		Knowledge Management (KM) is of growing interest in today's business and academic community. The increase in the number of books, articles and papers written reflects practitioners and academics alike trying to improve theories and concepts put forth by their peers to further support KM practice. This paper contributes to the stream of research on KM systems by proposing a KM environment to facilitate the knowledge evolution cycle. Guided by well-reviewed KM activities and the role of information technology and communication in strategically supporting knowledge processes, we have developed a KM system called KMsharer. The system consists of three major components: the XML editor, the KM tools and the WebShare server. The KMsharer uses an innovative XML knowledge-based schema for document conversion and storage has demonstrated to have better searching/accessing performance than the documents stored in common Word and XML formats. The KMsharer indeed is a powerful and useful tool for all personnel to access, create and store information in order to enhance knowledge sharing, collaboration and expedite decision-making strategically.

J	Dealtry, R				Dealtry, Richard			Global corporate priorities and demand-led learning strategies	JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE LEARNING			English	Article						Demand; Learning; Innovation; Corporate universities; Learning methods		Purpose - The purpose of this article is to start the process of exploring how to optimise connections between the strategic needs of an organisation as directed by top management and its learning management structures and strategies. Design/methodology/approach - The article takes a broad brush approach to a complex and large subject area that is influenced by many internal and external variables. It highlights two of the main strands to be managed in the dynamic process of seeking to optimise performance and return on investment in organisational based demand-led learning; learning that leads directly to decision making and resource allocation. Findings - There are many treatises on the subject of organisation theory and practice and related platforms for change management. The condition of autopoesis, emphasising the dynamic of self production in shaping organisation states, has featured prominently in these concepts and ideas of management. Indications are, however, that the demands and perturbations of the external environment are playing an increasing role in shaping organisations and the medium of learning is the catalyst by which means this trend is accelerating. Research limitations/implications - More empirical research (available at: www.ecuanet.info) into the effect of learning process innovations and behaviours on business performance and organisational capability development is required to put real foundation into what are being revealed about the benefits of learning in the workplace. Originality/value - Globalisation and global competition is placing greater emphasis on: releasing talent at all levels, the need for innovations in the creation and fulfilment of learning opportunities and the effective and efficient management of the firm's intellectual supply chain. The reactions at the learning supply-demand interface are changing and this article outlines perspectives that map the areas where relationships are changing as a basis for demand-led learning strategy formulation.

IMPROVISATION AND KNOWLEDGE The Challenge of Appropriation	MANAGEMENT RESEARCH-THE JOURNAL OF THE IBEROAMERICAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge management; Organizational improvisation; Innovation; Knowledge management		The literature on knowledge management and organizational improvisation have emerged as important perspectives for organizing, while existing almost in parallel. Both have significant implications for, inter alia, innovation and creativity, adaptability, and management in turbulent times. Previous research has considered the role of improvisation in innovation. We build on this literature to examine the specific role of improvisation in knowledge creation. Our assessment of organizational improvisation indicates that it constitutes an important potential source of knowledge, thus opening up a new avenue for exploring the strategic as well as political significance of embedded, situated knowledge. We argue that the rapprochement of the two literatures brings about the notion of "improvisational knowledge." We develop the significance of this form of knowledge, focusing in particular on the challenges of appreciating and appropriating it as opposed to seeking to codify it. We offer propositions and identify some avenues for further research.

J	Laugen, BT; Boer, H				Laugen, Bjorge Timenes; Boer, Harry			Continuous innovative practises and operational performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						continuous innovation; performance; survey; case	STRATEGY	Most contributions in the fields of strategic management, operations strategy, organisation and innovation theory, do not provide knowledge on how to pursue the combination of exploration and exploitation excellence. This paper investigates the impact of change initiatives in high performance companies, and the effects of organisational formalisation and centralisation on the time and timeliness performance of new product development projects. We analyse data collected through two multinational surveys of manufacturing companies and case studies of two manufacturing companies. The findings indicate that companies with a high degree of improvement in exploitation and exploration performance differ from low performers in terms of the width and depth of the implementation of improvement activities. Furthermore, high performers are actively aware of configurational effects. Formalisation does not only lead to a longer lead-time of radical innovation but also, contrary to what theory suggests, of incremental innovations. Centralisation only affects the timeliness of NPD projects.

J	Lima, JD; de Alencar, CT				Lima, Joao da Rocha, Jr.; de Alencar, Claudio Tavares			FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND THE BRAZILIAN REAL ESTATE MARKET	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Foreign investments; Brazil; Office market; Currency risk; Monte Carlo simulation		This article discusses the main aspects of the Brazilian real estate market in order to illustrate if it would be attractive for a typical American real estate investor to buy office-building portfolios in Brazil. The article emphasizes: [i] - the regulatory frontiers, comparing investment securitization, using a typical American REIT structure, with the Brazilian solution, using the Fundo de Investimento Imobiliario - FII; [ii] - the investment quality attributes in the Brazilian market, using an office building prototype, and [iii] - the comparison of [risk vs. yield] generated by an investment in the Brazilian market, using a FII, benchmarked against an existing REIT (OFFICE SUB-SECTOR) in the USA market. We conclude that investing dollars exchanged for Reais [the Brazilian currency] in a FII with a triple A office-building portfolio in the Sao Paulo marketplace will yield an annual income and a premium return above an American REIT investment. The highly aggressive scenario, along with the strong persistent exchange rate detachment to the IGP-M variations, plus instabilities affecting the generation of income, and even if we adopt a 300-point margin for the Brazil-Risk level, demonstrates that an investment opportunity in the Brazilian market, in the segment we have analyzed, outperforms an equivalent investment in the American market.

J	Lin, XH				Lin, Xiaohua			Appointing a general manager in Sino-US joint ventures Partner competence and organizational consequences	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						General management; Joint ventures; Management skills; Control; China; United States of America	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; PERFORMANCE; CONFLICT; TRUST; RISK	Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine performance implications of general manager appointment in Sino-US joint ventures, specifically whether there is a difference in outcomes when the appointment is made by the Chinese or American partner. Design/methodology/approach - Using a structured questionnaire, data were collected from 94 managers representing US and Chinese partners in 67 international joint ventures (IJVs) based in China. Findings - The results show that, when the general manager is Chinese rather than American, there is heightened conflict on daily personnel management issues, but not on strategic and contract issues, and the overall levels of partner satisfaction and relationship commitment decrease as well. Research limitations/implications - The research was based on small sample size and cross-sectional design. Originality/value - This article focuses on the general manager appointment as a control mechanism and explores its link to IJV performance. It identifies daily/personnel issues as a source of conflicts that are associated with the right to appoint the IJV general manager.

J	Misra, SC; Kumar, U; Kumar, V				Misra, Subhas C.; Kumar, Uma; Kumar, Vinod			Modelling strategic actor relationships for risk management in organizations undergoing business process reengineering due to information systems adoption	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Modelling; Risk management; Business process re-engineering; Information systems		Purpose - Because of the competitive economy, organizations today seek to rationalize, innovate and adapt to changing environments and circumstances as part of business process reengineering (BPR) efforts. Irrespective of the process reengineering program selected and the technique used to model it, BPR brings with it the issues of organizational and process changes. Thus, BPR initiatives involve risk taking. Effective management of risks and their prediction and estimation should help in minimizing failures from BPR efforts. Risk management is non-trivial due to the large uncertainty involved with business success with BPR efforts. Though some attempt has been made to model risk management in enterprise information systems using conventional conceptual modelling techniques, the previous works have analyzed and modeled the same just by addressing "what" a process is like, but do not address "why" the process is the way it is. Design/methodology/approach - The approach presents a new technique for analyzing and modelling early-phase requirements of organizational risk management that provides the motivations, intents, and rationales behind the entities and activities. Findings - A case study has been considered to illustrate this approach. Originality/value - The approach is novel in the sense that there is no similar intentional modeling approach for risk management to the best of one's knowledge. The approach is expected to be valuable because by using this approach one can reason about the risks associated with BPR and can incorporate prominently the issues related to risk in the process of systems analysis and design.

Integrating a random utility model for non-timber forest users into a strategic forest planning model	JOURNAL OF FOREST ECONOMICS			English	Article						decomposition techniques; harvest-scheduling; random utility model; landscape; recreational hunting	GOAL; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT; WILDLIFE; HABITAT	in this paper, we developed a mixed-integer non-linear programming model that integrates access road development and a utility theoretic spatial choice model of hunters into a strategic forest harvest-scheduling model. The model was applied to an operationally sized Forest Management Agreement (FN4A) area in central Alberta, Canada. The resulting behavioral model had approximately 2.6 million decision variables and about 96,000 constraints, and was used to examine the impacts of timber harvesting on hunters' preference for hunting sites. We also evaluated the impacts of various levels of hunter welfare on: (i) the degree of tradeoff between timber and hunting benefits, (ii) timber harvest schedules, and (iii) the marginal costs of producing timber products. The results showed significant tradeoffs between timber and hunting benefits and a clear link between landscape characteristics and changes and behavioral responses by hunters.

Services for distribution of tissue engineering products and therapies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Histology; Genetic engineering; Supply chain management; Distribution	ISSUES	Purpose - Tissue engineering (TE) offers treatments for chronic, life threatening, degenerative illnesses and possibilities for restoring cellular or organ functions that have been lost due to injuries or hereditary conditions. However, a prerequisite for the use of TE products as part of future therapies is the development of strategies for safe and efficient supply chain management and versatile services spanning from product development to a follow-up period of possibly decades. The present study aims to explore the future needs for services and extended supply chains for safe delivery of health care, procurement, distribution and long-term follow-up of TE products and therapies. Design/methodology/approach - Studies in operational disciplines and coordination systems for different types of supply chains and service networks are used to formulate a framework for developing services throughout product lifecycle. Case examples of TE products are presented to demonstrate complexity, microbial risks, services and long-term follow-up. The role of logistics and the necessary services are identified for products classified into experimental, therapy and standard products. Findings - The paper finds that, through the stages, the importance of logistics increases from an enabler to becoming a strategic tool, emphasizing logistics requirements in establishing a viable TE supply chain. New dimensions to existing service operations frameworks are needed where proactive tissue sourcing, long follow-up periods, short shelf life and biological risks call for enforcing flexible services with tissue banks, detailed tracing, authorization and regulation. Originality/value - The paper presents the discovery of the logistics services and service institutions that will become imperatives for the future success of TE products and therapies.

The evolution of biotechnology in hostile financing environments	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Biotechnology; Organizational change; Strategic alliances; Downsizing; Germany	POPULATION ECOLOGY; INDUSTRY; FIRM; US	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the development of the biotechnology industry at the industry and firm level when the financing environment becomes hostile and assess the reasons for this development. Design/methodology/approach - An organizational evolution perspective to analyze the case of the German biotech sector was applied and its response to the hostile financing environment in the years 2002-2004, which followed the burst of the high-tech bubble at the stock markets. Population ecology and data from biotech reports to investigate the pattern of external adaptation processes at the industry level were used. The evolutionary economics perspective, multiple case studies of bioventures, and biotech reports to study internal adaptation processes at the firm level was employed. Findings - The assumption of both external and internal adaptation processes was found in parallel is necessary to explain the evolution of the biotech industry in a hostile financing environment. Although external adaptation takes place to some extent through insolvencies and a reduced rate of new firm foundations, many bioventures adapt internally by downsizing, changing their business models, and entering into strategic alliances and M&As. This results in surprisingly weak consolidation at the industry level. Originality/value - This paper provides an explanation why the consolidation of the German biotech industry in 2002-2004 was much weaker than expected by experts. Moreover, the paper shows that application of population ecology and evolutionary economics in parallel well describes industry evolution and organizational change. Finally, the paper demonstrates how bioventures can adapt their financing strategies to hostile environments.

Design/methodology/approach - The study uses the statistical co-plot method reported in a similar study of leading full time MBA programmes in the USA. The method is used to map/group the schools according to both core and elective units offered by the business schools. Findings - The paper outlines the features of the six groups of MBA programmes found (Cluster 1: Manchester and Bath; Cluster 2: Warwick, Lancaster and London; Cluster 3: five top French business schools and Cranfield; Cluster 4: two French schools - Grenoble and Audiencia-Nantes; Cluster 5: two French schools - ENPC-EAP and IEP; Cluster 6: the remaining UK MBA programmes). The differentiating characteristics of core and option units offered by business schools in each cluster are described and discussed. Originality/value - The study makes a contribution under the application area of international business education (specifically the design of MBA programmes), as well as in the area of statistical analysis by using co-plot cluster analysis, an approach not used before when comparing UK and French Business schools to explore aspects of curriculum design.

Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) and internal and external (IE) matrix have been applied in order to illustrate the main path long term planning and development. The benchmarking process has been performed by analyzing seven successful developing countries. Findings - The results imply that Iran should implement six main strategies for increasing productivity and efficiency, reducing costs, renewing structure and making private, applying IT, increasing productivity of human resources, and environment protection. Benchmarking study shows that Iran has to speed up the environment protection program. Research limitations/implications - Although the use of the SWOT and IE matrix provide great advantages, the analysis should apply BSC in developing execution plans. Practical implications - The results encourage the Iran power industry since five out of six main strategies have already been chosen for long-term development. Originality/value - The paper has provided considerable evidence to suggest that the proposed strategies are in line with benchmarked countries policies in the power industry.	[Razmi, J.; Ghaderi, S.

J	Suder, G; Chailan, C; Suder, D				Suder, Gabriele; Chailan, Claude; Suder, David			Strategic megabrand management: does global uncertainty affect brands? A post-9/11 US/non-US comparison of the 100 biggest brands	JOURNAL OF PRODUCT AND BRAND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Terrorism; Brands; Uncertainty management		Purpose - The primary purpose of this study is to identify if and how international terrorism has altered the rank and value of brands, and whether the increasing uncertainty of globalizing risks need an adaptation of international brand management. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology for this study was exploratory and quantitative at the same time, and utilized longitudinal brand ranking and a cross-sector and cross-industry data in a comparative research design. Both descriptive and relational statistics are used to analyze the data. Findings - The key findings reveal that, in the five consecutive years after 9/11/2001, brands have experienced significant moderation in rank and value. A significant gap in the evolution of US and non-US brands was found in this period of time. The evidence calls for brand management that reflects the risks that globalized at the same pace as brand reach. Research limitations/implications - The limitations to the study are that the findings cannot explore all possible causes of uncertainty, but it nevertheless provides strong indications. Originality/value - Managers should not assume that terrorism and other globalizing risks only cause direct physical destruction; they need to be adequately prepared to handle indirect impact that can alter the rank and value of their brands. The paper identifies specific areas for future megabrand strategy and calls for its internationalization.

Global Market Integration and China's Rubber Industry: Challenges and the Way Forward	ASIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						rubber industry; economic integration; natural rubber; synthetic rubber; tyre industry; rubber growers		This paper, while reviewing the development and growth of the rubber production sector in China from a historical perspective, discusses the major challenges confronting the sustainable growth of rubber-based industries in the era of global market integration. The challenges arise from the growing shortage of resources (both natural and synthetic rubber) against the fast-growing automobile and tyre manufacturing industries. While the dynamic growth of the rubber industry in the pre-reforms era was achieved under a heavy import-oriented trade policy regime, the sustaining of the same is fraught with serious challenges in the context of market integration. Following a comprehensive analysis of the development of the rubber industry in retrospect, this paper suggests some important policy options for carrying forward and, thereby, sustaining the growth dynamism of the industry in the Country in the emerging scenario. It emerges from the study that the sustainable growth of the rubber-based industry in China calls for a thorough revamping of state policies and devising new institutional development strategies covering a broad spectrum of activities, including: (a) demand and supply management; (b) redefining the status of natural rubber as a strategic commodity and industrial raw material; (c) restructuring the production sector favouring smallholder producers; and (d) R&D investments facilitating rubber expansion to agro-ecologically suitable areas. Given that global market integration would continue to stimulate the growth of the domestic rubber industry, this paper highlights that issues at the production sector are to be tackled on a priority basis. However, this would need China to make a rational choice between one or a combination of alternatives, including: (a) strengthening the existing domestic natural rubber production sector; (b) continue with the prevailing natural and synthetic rubber import policies; (c) increased substitution between natural and synthetic rubber; and (d) strengthening rubber investment programmes (including domestic and foreign direct investment) in neighbouring countries, namely, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar and the Philippines.

J	Wood, S				Wood, Steve			Reinterpreting the great US department store bankruptcies of the 1980s A catalyst to strategic structural change	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT HISTORY			English	Article						Leveraged buy-outs; Organizational restructuring; Department stores; Retailing; Qualitative research; United States of America		Purpose - The financial restructuring of the US department store industry is commonly interpreted as a time of corporate excess, value-destruction and ultimately collapse. The purpose of this paper is to re-analyse these events using qualitative methods to understand the background to the leveraged transactions and to review the implications that their failure had for the longer term strategy and structure of the US department store industry. Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on two extensive periods of fieldwork in the US when the author interviewed (n = 28) many of the protagonists of the 1980s restructuring period and those who inherited the management of the bankrupt businesses in the 1990s. By adopting a qualitative perspective, we are accessing social and human perspectives of these developments as well as their wider effects. Findings - The leveraged transactions were conceptually an appropriate attempt to centralise the structure of the industry but their execution was not possible under such extreme financial distress. However, bankruptcy protection provided the environmental conditions to realise the benefits of more efficient strategic and subsequent wide-ranging structural change. Originality/value - This research differs from economistic readings of the period that analyse changes in market value of the constituent firms and the more reactionary journalistic accounts. The paper re-casts the failed financial restructuring in a new light, underlining the regenerative effects of Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection in promoting firm revival, alongside visionary leadership.

J	So, S				So, SoonHoo			An Empirical Analysis on the Operational Efficiency of CRM Call Centers in Korea	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY			English	Article						Call Center; Operational Efficiency; Key Performance Indicators; Caller Satisfaction; DEA; CRM; Business Process Outsourcing		As CRM has come into the spotlight, call center, which is at the cutting edge of CRM strategy, is newly spotlighted as an important communication channel of relationship between company and customer. Since call center handles more than 70% of all customer contacts, there is no doubt that efficient and effective call center operation is vital for ensuring customer satisfaction remains high. Despite the strategic importance of the call center, however, there has been no empirical research completed on the efficiency of call center operation. The purpose of this study was therefore to assess the operational efficiency of call centers in Korea, to indentify the current status and issues of call center operations, and to suggest ways to improve operational efficiency. For this purpose, non-parametric efficiency measurement method, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), was applied to cross-sectional data for 43 domestic call centers to compare their relative efficiency. According to the empirical results of applying the input-oriented BCC model of DEA, 19 call centers were identified as efficient call centers while the rest were identified as relatively inefficient call centers. In conclusion, it is anticipated that the methodology suggested herein may be applied to various contexts including call center certification, call center outsourcing management, and call center agents productivity diagnosis.

J	Nordberg, D				Nordberg, Donald			Rebalancing the board's agenda	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Since 2002, the activities of corporate boards have been dominated by the governance agenda. In Europe - to an even greater degree than the United States - governance codes have proliferated. This paper examines the resulting imbalance, where compliance with codes of conduct threatens to overwhelm the board's primary responsibility, i.e. the creation of wealth. We consider a model of board processes that starts with four key roles: setting direction, marshalling resources, controlling and reporting, and evaluating and enhancing for the next cycle. "We must urgently bring back some pragmatism to corporate governance . . . And if we want governance schemes that actually work in a real business environment, they must be based on principles, not detailed rules that try to pre-empt all the eventualities a lawyer can think of" Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, CEO, Nestle SA. The governance agenda has rightly drawn attention to the work of board committees and the question of the independence of mind directors need to show. But it may have diverted focus from three questions that ought to figure more prominently in the board's work: How should the board apportion its work between compliance, risk assessment and setting strategic direction? How do directors become determine when to focus on risk-mitigation and when to encourage strategic risk-taking? In face of greater personal accountability for governance compliance, where do they draw the line between their role overseeing management and interfering with management's responsibilities?

J	Poskela, J				Poskela, Jarno			STRATEGIC AND OPERATIVE LEVEL FRONT-END INNOVATION ACTIVITIES - INTEGRATION PERSPECTIVE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Front-end of innovation; innovation management; strategy implementation	PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; IMPLEMENTATION; FRAMEWORK; PROJECTS	The front-end phase is in the literature generally regarded as the most critical phase of the innovation process. Front-end management has a strategic nature since important decisions related e.g. to target markets and the main functionalities of products are done in the front-end phase. This article examines how the integration of strategic and operative level front-end activities is perceived by top managers in the product innovation context. The findings indicate that companies exploit different strategy-making processes, and that each strategy-making mode is prone to particular integration challenges. The results show that the effectiveness of integration of strategic and operative level front-end activities is dependent on the level of concreteness of the defined business strategies, the amount of business-minded decision making, and the balance between control and creativity.

As an innovative approach to strategic planning, and forming the city visioning umbrella for the Strategic Planning and Performance Management Framework of Council, Logan 2026 City Directions has facilitated greater engagement with the community and represents an opportunity for Council to explore and build on the organisation's foresight capacity and to enhance internal communications within the organisation. One significant by-product has been ongoing dialogue and actions of the workshop groups in Council seeking to address such issues as climate change.

J	Rose, GC				Rose, Graeme C.			The role of principal empowerment within a site-based management environment: empirical testing of a structural model	JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL CHANGE			English	Article						Education policy; Innovation; Psychological empowerment; School-based management; Transformational leadership	SCHOOL-BASED MANAGEMENT; PSYCHOLOGICAL EMPOWERMENT; CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP; TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP; SELF-EFFICACY; DETERMINANTS; SATISFACTION; BEHAVIORS	A model examining psychological empowerment, transformational leadership and innovation for school principals is proposed and tested within a Site (School)-Based Management environment. Developed from management literature, the model was adapted for state school principals experiencing increased decision-making powers and accountability. Empirical results provide a level of support for the model. 'Role clarity' and 'access to resources' were found to exert a positive influence on principals' feelings of empowerment, though the value placed by principals on strategic information was found to have a slightly negative influence. The influence of empowerment on transformational leadership was not found to be as strong as anticipated. The paper includes a discussion of the implications of these findings for theory and policy development.

Controlling upland invasive exotic plants on public conservation land: a strategic plan	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL			English	Article						adaptive management; control operations; invasive species; public conservation land; strategic plan		The Upland Invasive Exotic Plant Management Program is responsible for the control of terrestrial invasive plant species infesting public conservation land in Florida. To assist in achieving this long-term goal, the program drafted a Strategic Plan based upon the structural principles of: (1) leadership from the state level; (2) partnership amongst all levels of government agencies and other affected parties; (3) dedicated funding and implementation procedures for a statewide program; (4) a system of inventory and monitoring of invasive species; and (5) adoption of adaptive management strategies on public conservation land. Although the plan is written specifically for Florida, the core principles and implementation strategies are applicable to any state seeking to initiate a statewide invasive species control program.

J	Lindeque, JP				Lindeque, Johan Paul			A Firm Perspective of Anti-dumping and Countervailing Duty Cases in the United States	JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE			English	Article							POLITICAL STRATEGY; DECISIONS; ECONOMY; RISE	The role played by firms in the prosecution of anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases in the United States is understudied. This article provides greater understanding of the challenges faced by firms during the process of prosecuting anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases in the United States. This is achieved by applying a theoretical model of corporate political activity to data collected through interviews with 24 trade attorneys in Washington, D.C., practising in the area of anti-dumping and countervailing duty law. Anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases are found to require significant resource commitments from firms in the participating industries, as well as requiring individual firms to make a number of strategic decisions. The value of an affirmative decision and imposition of duties to the domestic and foreign industry is found to be more nuanced than previous studies have suggested. Non-duty effects of AD and CVD cases are also confirmed. Finally a clearer understanding of the role of individual firms in anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases is shown to have the potential to improve how industry influence is taken account of in future research.

A Baiting Environmental Attention Process (B.E.A.PRO) was developed and used to help managers make sense of weak signals in their relevant environment and how these signals could impact decision-making under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity. The study shows that B.E.A.PRO might be an effective tactic for triggering a collective learning process, leading Tunisian SMEs to question their existing way of seeing the environment. The study also showed that a successful baiting process could not continue when the expert and the knowledge facilitator leaves. As usual, companies that believe they can rely on their own human resources, without creating the environment that will encourage them to stay, will likely fail.

Specifically, the paper refers to the crucial problem of environmentally analysing the Urban Waste System Management Process. The application of the Dashboard of Sustainability has been deliberately suggested. The method has been selected because of its intrinsic simplicity and because it can provide the simultaneous evaluation of indicators which refer to different fields, such as the Environment, Economics and Quality in Institutional Services. The method has been applied to the city of Palermo. The results obtained have been compared to a couple of ideal scenarios.

Indications are that the perceptions of a sample of senior managers regarding how well their institutions manage their brands are reasonably positive, and that the management of brands has effects on a firm's profitability, market share and growth compared to competitors. While the checklist used seems to possess the characteristic of reliabil ity, further development needs to be done on aspects of its underlying structure. Implications for managers and further avenues for research are identified and discussed. (C) 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

In addition, the relationship between the implementation of the key factors and sourcing performance in the Hong Kong toy industry are investigated. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical research is based on a questionnaire survey that collected data from 205 Hong Kong toy companies. The survey investigated the degree of importance of key success strategic sourcing factors and the extent of implementation of the key factors in the companies. Furthermore, the sourcing performance of the companies was measured to investigate its relationship with the implementation of the key factors. Findings - The research identifies five core values and 14 key success factors in strategic sourcing through literature reviews. The survey findings indicate that the identified key success factors are important and positively related to the sourcing performance. Moreover, the results show that the implementation of strategic sourcing in the Hong Kong toy industry is lagging behind the degree of importance of strategic sourcing.

Fazel			Strategic alliance for core competencies improvement in textile industries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategic alliances; textile; globalization; core competencies		Strategic alliances are increasingly gaining popular for Textile companies to achieve fast and economical growth in today's globalization. Strategic alliances are an important source of resources, learning, and thereby core competencies improvement. So managers have to make conscious decisions to develop certain competencies and in order to have all competencies that are required to be successful, firms look for strategic alliances and to leverage their partner firms' competencies. However coordination with alliance partners is not easy; each part has its own reporting process and measures, and each brings its own perspective of what it wants to contribute to the alliance and what it intents to obtain from the alliance. Transcending these informational and motivational asymmetries, as economists would phrase it, requires an open, transparent process in which both sides clearly articulate their expected contributions and their desired outcomes resulting in a document that summarizes the theory of the strategic for the alliance. Developing an Alliance Balanced Scorecard (ABS) can mitigate the natural conflict between alliance partners. It include four-perspective framework: financial, strategic, operational, and relationship. This study has been made on how to apply the Balanced Scorecard on an alliance-making of 8 Textile companies as a result of a demand. We aim to provide a picture of what a prospective Textile Industries could look like, for the alliance-making in Iran, by developing an Alliance Strategy Map focused on the core competencies improvement. The work has been conducted as a qualitative case study at the Textile firms in Isfahan. The scorecard was developed by using analytic hierarchy process (AHP). We argue that results based on AHP analysis would help a company to make more informed strategic management decision concerning further investment for competences and key assets development, and outsourcing non-core assets and competences. This paper reports on the results of that empirical survey, the results show that: Maintain market position; Expanding their competencies; Gain access to complementary resources; Compete against common competitor; Reducing risk and uncertainty are important influences on alliance making for textile companies. Careful strategic planning and good partnership preparation are essential for alliance success.	[Dadashian, F.; Shakibfar, S.] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Text Engn Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Zarandi, M. H.

The choice of employment arrangement in the market for hospitalist services	SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd Annual Southeastern-Health-Economics-Study- Group Conference	NOV, 2005	Univ S Carolina, Dept Econ, Charleston, SC	SE Hlth Econ Study Grp	Univ S Carolina, Dept Econ		DOCTOR-PATIENT-RELATIONSHIP; UNITED-STATES; CARE; OUTCOMES; MODELS; COSTS	Hospitalists specialize in the management of patients who are hospitalized. Despite a uniformity of work sites, educational backgrounds, and tasks, however, newly available survey data from the American Hospital Association and the Society of Hospital Medicine reveal substantial diversity in employment arrangements. We reconcile these observations by noting that the two principal players on the health care continuum-primary care physicians who refer their patients and hospitals who admit them-have strong but differing motives for using hospitalists. We show how strategic interaction between the two players may give rise to multiple equilibria in which either the primary care physician group or the hospital ends up being the sole employer of hospitalists in a given market. Over time, the growing infrequency of hospitalization and variation in the cost of setting up a hospitalist program may explain the shifting predominance of different employment arrangements.

J	Dolnicar, S				Dolnicar, Sara			Management learning exercise and trainer's note for market segmentation in tourism	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURE TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY RESEARCH			English	Article						Market segmentation; Learning; Training; Tourism management		Purpose - This paper aims to show how researchers can develop learning exercises for training analysts and executives in market segmentation techniques. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical example of a tour operator specializing in adventure tourism is used as an illustration. Segments are constructed on the basis of tourists' stated willingness to pay a price premium for certain aspects of the tour. Stability analysis is conducted to choose the number of clusters, topology representing networks are used to construct segments and Bonferroni-corrected chi(2) tests provide insight into the external validity of segments. Findings - Four market segments are constructed which differ significantly with respect to external variables. Research limitations/implications - Market segmentation can be used by any entity in the tourism industry to select a suitable part of the entire market, customize the tourism service to suit such a segment, and spend marketing budget more efficiently by using communication channels and advertising messages most effective for the selected segment. Originality/value - Market segmentation provides managers with insight into market structure. Knowledge about the market structure, in turn, is the basis of successful strategic planning. While the concept of segmentation is not new, each application is unique to its context. The present paper focuses on price premium segments in the adventure tourism context.

J	Doyle, E				Doyle, Eleanor			Compliance obstacles to competitiveness	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Competitive strategy; Regulation; Production management; Consumption		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explain the competitiveness obstacles that European businesses face, which, if not addressed, limit the potential of the EU economy, particularly in terms of the Lisbon goals. Adopting a broadly defined compliance-centred approach, the paper seeks to identify how some significant competitiveness obstacles of European business might best be addressed. Design/methodology/approach - In-depth interviews in 44 multinational and medium-sized companies were used to investigate compliance requirements, the tools and methods used to manage compliance, compliance-related obstacles to competitiveness. A survey of four European Information Centres was conducted to evaluate their effectiveness in achieving their stated mission. Findings - Organisations lacked systems to proactively manage compliance to allow them to deepen or sustain their competitive positioning. Companies were concerned with the reliability and comprehensiveness of reports on compliance risks and how these could be related to prioritised strategic goals. A gap was identified between regulation production and dissemination, and conversion of regulatory information into knowledge used to gain and maintain business advantage. This gap is inadequately filled by business supports, including the European Information Centres. Originality/value - The business-focused approach to managing compliance suggested here could increase the competitiveness of EU businesses and the EIC Network is potentially well positioned to play its part in the value-adding process of both the providers and consumers of EU information.

Both perspectives are successful in predicting diffusion. The institutional contexts of business units within multinationals and key strategic context variables are shown, in a study of 20 UK multinationals in Europe, to have significant and interacting relationships with the degree of similarity between affiliate HRM systems and those of their parent counterparts.

J	Gogan, JL; Gelinas, UJ; Rao, A				Gogan, Janis L.; Gelinas, Ulric J., Jr.; Rao, Ashok			Learning in a consortium: a longitudinal case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						inter-organisational learning; emerging technologies; R&D consortia	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; COLLABORATION; PERSPECTIVE; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE; NETWORKS; TRUST; BIOTECHNOLOGY; INSTABILITY	Alliances formed to investigate emerging technologies often fall short of participants' expectations. Das and Teng (2000) proposed that successful alliances (such as those undertaken by R&D consortia) hold three 'competing tensions' in balance, with varying emphasis across several stages in the life of an R&D alliance. This paper reports on a longitudinal case study of an initiative conducted by the Financial Services Technology Consortium to develop and test a new payment system, the eCheck. Consistent with the studies of Das and Teng, we found strong evidence of the stages and competing tensions. However, all three tensions were seen across the stages of the eCheck initiative. Based on these findings, we propose that all three competing tensions need to be managed throughout the life of an inter-organisational learning initiative, and that tensions accelerate (and thus need to be managed most carefully) as a project moves closer to commercial implementation.

J	Huang, CY; Holt, A; Monk, J; Cheng, K				Huang, Chi-Yu; Holt, Alan; Monk, John; Cheng, Kai			The application of dependency management in an integrated manufacturing network framework	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						dependency management; mobile agent itinerary; process-driven		Research into the effectiveness and performance of the mobile agent (MA) technology as a means of managing a domain of manufacturing devices has been conducted. However, it has been shown that MAs are not without their scalability issues. A strategic agent travelling algorithm will bring performance improvement as it allows agents to identify the best migration path in order to minimise the total expected time of searching for the desired information. The applications of process-driven dependency management along with MA techology are examined as methods for optimising the efficiency of retrieving critical information in the manufacturing environment. An integrated framework is developed to investigate the alignment of network management paradigm to the strategic management decision.

J	Hughes, T; Foss, B; Stone, M; Cheverton, P				Hughes, Tim; Foss, Bryan; Stone, Merlin; Cheverton, Peter			Degrees of separation: technological interactivity and account management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING			English	Article						Accounts management; Financial services; Relationship marketing; Key accounts; Communication technologies	CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS; KNOWLEDGE; QUALITY; ADVANTAGE; COMPANY; TRUST	Purpose - There has been an increasing application of remote technology to customer service. This research, from business-to-business financial services, seeks to gain insight and understanding into how the supplier/customer relationship and account management are impacted. Design/methodology/approach - Taking a realism approach, the qualitative research in this study was based on gaining access to experts, suppliers and customers who had direct experience of the subject area. Findings - Three levels of account management are identified in the paper: transactional, operational and strategic. The service offered at all levels often requires close and intensive cooperation on both sides, but increasingly it has been centralised and automated. Key account management is practised as an integrative relationship function, but it has limitations and by definition it is not available to all customers. Research limitations/implications - This exploratory research suggests a number of factors that may impact on the effectiveness of remote servicing. Understanding the relationship impact of remote servicing may be enhanced by recognising the appropriate levels and types of service for each situation. Further research is needed in this area. Practical implications - Managers need to carefully consider the transactional, operational and strategic implications of applying new technologies to managing interactions with customers. A better understanding of these may help in justifying the expense of relational efforts in account servicing. Originality/value - In providing contextually rich data from a sector that is utilising technology as part of a strategy to centralise and automate many aspects of customer service this research explores some important aspects of remote servicing.

Benchmarking efficiencies and strategies for resale operations of a charity organization	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Benchmarking; Operations management; Charities; Data analysis; Strategic planning		Purpose - This paper aims to analyze and benchmark the operating efficiency of resale shops run by a charity organization and to suggest strategies for improved operations. Design/methodology/approach - Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to compare the operations of nine resale shops of a charity organization. Data include annual reports of the shops for two years. Findings - The relatively efficient shops are located in the affluent communities, the eastern parts of the city. Accordingly, location is a major contributor to operating efficiency. For resource utilization, charges related to buildings are mostly underutilized among expenses, especially ownership costs and rents. DEA was found to be a useful approach for benchmarking resale operations. Research limitations/implications - This study is subject to the limitations of DEA, which measures relative technical efficiencies of decision-making units. Results will vary according to data and decision-making units included in the model. Originality/value - The contributions of this study are found in the first attempt for benchmarking resale operations of a charity organization and in its strong practical application.

J	Motha, RP				Motha, Raymond P.			Implications of climate change on long-lead forecasting and global agriculture	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Expert Team Workshop on Impact of Climate Change/Variability and Medium- to Long-Range Predictions for Agriculture	FEB 15-18, 2005	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	Queensland Dept Primary Ind & Fisheries, WMO		natural disasters; drought; inter-annual prediction; climate scenarios; adaptation strategies; climate risk management	WESTERN UNITED-STATES; ENSO	Variations in crop yields and agricultural productivity are strongly influenced by fluctuations in seasonal weather conditions during the growing season. The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, and other similar ocean/atmosphere teleconnections in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, contribute to extreme weather events and climatic variability. As seasonal forecasting skills improve with greater knowledge of these teleconnections and improved Global Circulation Models (GCMs), farmers and agricultural planners will be able to make better use of long- lead forecasts for strategic decisions in agriculture. Issues related to climate variability and climate change pose significant risks to agriculture as the frequency of natural disasters tends to increase worldwide.

J	Murphy, KS; DiPietro, RB; Murrmann, S				Murphy, Kevin S.; DiPietro, Robin B.; Murrmann, Suzanne			A Proposed Research Agenda for the Refinement of the High Performance Work System Construct in the U.S. Restaurant Industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						High performance work practices (HPWP); restaurant industry; strategic human resource management (SHRM); human resource management (HRM)		The current research proposes a framework for the investigation and conceptualization of high performance work systems in the U.S. restaurant industry. The projected U.S. restaurant industry sales for 2006 are $ 511.1 billion according to the National Restaurant Association (National Restaurant Association, 2005). Because of its size and impact on the foodservice industry and the hospitality industry in general, improving the performance of the restaurant industry could help increase overall revenues and guest satisfaction in the foodservice and hospitality industry. By identifying a list of high performance work practices in the industry, a more in-depth exploration of these practices and then organizational policies can be aligned together to help improve overall performance in the U.S. restaurant industry. The current study provides theoretical background and support for the high performance work systems theory. (C) 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

Sadly, although there are 515 accredited business schools (as of January 2006) in 28 countries, Africa-with 54 nations-does not have a single AACSB accredited school. Many African business schools (ABSs) have the capacity to meet Standard 1 (mission statement), Standard 3 (student mission), and Standard 4 (continuous improvement objectives). But they have limited capacity to meet Standard 2 (mission appropriateness) and Standard 5 (financial strategies). Therefore, if AACSB-International wishes to truly become the accrediting agency for business schools world-wide, the agency and its members will need to play a more proactive, facilitative and enabling role in assisting business schools in Africa tackle these significant obstacles to accreditation.

J	Nagy, AL; Cenker, WJ				Nagy, Albert L.; Cenker, William J.			Accounting firms cautiously maneuver in the new audit environment - a note	MANAGERIAL AUDITING JOURNAL			English	Article						External auditing; Auditors; Corporate governance; Quality		Purpose - This paper seeks to discuss the effect that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOA) had on both the nature of the external audit function and overall audit quality. Additionally, it aims to discuss how audit firms maneuvered through the newly regulated environment, and what their strategic actions are for the future. Design/methodology/approach - This discussion is based on interviews conducted with auditors from nine public accounting firms located in Northeast Ohio, United States of America. The sample consisted of five national and four regional firms, and the interviewees included mostly partners and a few senior managers. Findings - The increased oversight and workload resulting from the SOA requirements has changed the nature of the external audit function to more compliance type work, and the environment has created much anxiety for the auditors. The new reform has significantly impacted the audit environment in terms of: scope of services; client assessment procedures; management and audit committee relationships with the external auditor; audit firm personnel management; and the long-term outlook of the profession. The details of these impacts are discussed throughout the paper. Research limitations/implications - This paper provides detailed insight as to how the SOA impacted the audit profession. Hopefully, such an understanding will benefit future research in measuring the costs and benefits of the new reform. Lastly, a future research showed further examine the effect that the SOA has had on overall audit quality. Originality/value - This paper summarizes the insightful comments obtained in structured interviews with several leading audit professionals. The sample was judged to be highly knowledgeable of the changing audit environment caused by the SOA. With an improved understanding of its impacts, regulators, practitioners, and academics can better assess the effectiveness of the SOA.

Developing internet operations and subcultural dynamics - An exploratory study	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						organizational culture; Internet; financial services	ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; BOUNDARIES; ROLES	Purpose - It is commonly argued that the exponential growth in the application of internet technology is one of the most important recent developments in business and management. However, although much research has been conducted on the strategic and operational aspects of the internet there is a surprising dearth of research on the organizational cultural dynamics of this technological innovation. The purpose of this study is to examine the implications of introducing an internet-led strategy on organizational culture. Design/methodology/approach - Specifically, the study explores the attempts by management to exploit the introduction of internet operations as a catalyst to transform the culture of the organization. Findings - It is argued that although a number of factors (such as organizational centrality and senior management patronage) increased the profile of the Internet Operations Unit the attempt by this unit to dominate subcultural dynamics was met with difficulties, dissenting voices and issues that were not wholly consistent with the wishes of senior management Originality/value - The paper offers insight into the emergent subcultures and the attempts of their members to increase their visibility and influence within the organization as a whole.

J	Taylor, K; Corrall, S				Taylor, Katherine; Corrall, Sheila			Personalized service? Changing the role of the government librarian	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						government libraries; information work; personalized services; value-added services	EXPERIENCE	This study investigated the feasibility of a personalized information service in a government department. A qualitative methodology explored stakeholder opinions on the remit, marketing, resourcing and measurement of the service. A questionnaire and interviews gathered experiences of personalized provision across the government sector. Potential users were similarly surveyed to discuss how the service could meet their needs. Data were analysed using coding techniques to identify emerging theory. Lessons learned from government librarians centred on clarifying requirements, balancing workloads and selective marketing. The user survey showed low usage and awareness of existing specialist services, but high levels of need and interest in services repackaged as a tailored offering. Fieldwork confirmed findings from the literature on the scope for adding value through information management advice, information skills training and substantive research assistance and the need to understand business processes and develop effective partnerships.

J	Tolley, DC; Payne, R				Tolley, David C.; Payne, Richard			Hospice partnerships with academic entities: Philosophical and historical background and assessment of future needs	JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT			English	Article						hospice; research; academic partnership; end-of-life care	CARE	There is consensus that more research is needed to help improve care at the end of life. Despite the fact that hospices take care of more and more dying persons every year, hospice organizations have not been highly involved in research. The National Hospice Work Group is comprised of hospice organizations that have made promotion of research a high priority. Structured interviews were conducted with members of the National Hospice Work Group to investigate how they think about the role of academic partners in their organizational missions, what their histories of involvement with academic partners are, and what they see as their most important academic needs for continuing to advance the research agenda. Members of the National Hospice Work Group see strategic partnerships with academic entities as essential to the goal of advancing research in end-of-life care.

J	Vorasubin, P; Chareonngam, C				Vorasubin, Piyanut; Chareonngam, Chotchai			Strategic assets driving financial capability of Thai construction firms	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF PROPERTY AND CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						strategic asset; resource-based view; financial capability; construction firm		Technological advancement, innovative procurement patterns such as build-operate-transfer, build-own-operate-transfer as well as intrusion of international contractors have immensely changed the construction market. Local contractors need to devise a strategy to raise not only its technological capability but also financial capability which becomes increasingly necessary to compete successfully in this new landscape. This study aimed to investigate strategic assets which have been driving financial capability of construction firms in Thailand. Four large construction firms in Thailand were investigated through case study method and the result was verified with twelve industry experts. Three strategic assets were found contributing to competitive advantage of Thai construction firms including access to capital, efficient cash management, and effective capital investment. It was also found that strong relationship was the needed ingredient in developing these particular assets in Thailand. The findings should assist managers of construction firms in realizing the impact of financial capability, envisaging its driving strategic assets, and comprehending the mechanism which provides competitive advantage.

J	Yilmaz, R				Yilmaz, R.			Environmental impacts on the protected areas. A case study in Thrace region, Turkey	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						thrace region; protected areas; environmental impacts; conservation		The Thrace region is located in the north-west part of Turkey. The region, which is the only land of Turkey in Europe, has strategic significance as well as natural beauties and resources such as forests, mountains, lakes, wetlands, coasts and seas. The total area of the Thrace region is 24 378 km(2), which covers 2.99% of the total area of Turkey. The Thrace region is one of the most industrialised and developed area of Turkey. Agriculture, industrialisation and urbanisation cause many environmental problems and degradation in the region. The Thrace region which includes coastal ecosystem, forest ecosystem, aquatic ecosystem and agricultural ecosystem, is under the pressure of the various environmental effects due to intensive land uses. Integrated ecosystems of forests, coastal zones, mountains, wetlands and other protected areas have both ecological and economical values for the people living in the region. An alternative activity, which gives priority to the protection of natural and cultural values, should be improved for the people. Environmental assessment will be used to evaluate the environmental impacts of the proposed development policy and plan about land use, agriculture, industrialisation, water management, regional development, etc. As a result of this research, environmental impacts on protected areas have been identified and evaluated in the light of various criterions.

Developing audit standards required for outbreaks of communicable diseases - lessons from a mumps outbreak	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						audit; MMR; mumps; outbreak	NOTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT	Background A mumps outbreak occurred in 2004-05 in England and Wales. The outbreak in the Avon area of England led to mass vaccination of 16- to 24-year-olds with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR). The response to the outbreak was audited. Literature and web searches for audit standards were undertaken, and experts in the field were contacted. No comprehensive audit standards for outbreaks of communicable diseases were found. This article describes an approach to developing audit standards for outbreaks of communicable diseases. Methods Audit standards were developed based on the memorandum of understanding between the National Health Service (NHS) and Health Protection Agency.The audit was undertaken involving 25 staff. Results The audit standards developed identified many areas for improvement including training, strategic co-ordination, inter-organizational communication, consistency and timeliness of communication. Conducting the audit was problematic because there were not pre-defined audit standards. Conclusions Audit standards should be developed, which include issues relating to the structure, process and outcome of responses to outbreaks. The development of audit standards for the management of outbreaks is crucial to evaluate outbreak control and make necessary improvements.

Bank presence in firm equity: A diversification based approach	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article							CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION; OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE; STRATEGY	This study analyses the possible reasons for banks deciding to invest in firm equity, based on the fundamentals of the strategic diversification literature. Those fundamentals suggest that it may be in response to the negative evolution of other aspects of banking business, namely, credit business, fixed interest business and services, as well as the bank's level of efficiency. The results confirm the hypotheses that the decision to hold equity in other firms is related to the evolution of the bank's other businesses. However, the results for savings banks differed from those for banks.

Not all information technology offshoring projects, however, are successful. Cost overruns, increased complexity and defective code cause organizations to rethink their offshoring strategy and their methods for managing these projects. In this paper, project management issues associated with offshore information technology outsourcing projects are identified and specific recommendations for addressing these issues are presented.

Each municipality partially funds the organization. Depending on the partnership contract, a free rider problem may jeopardize the organization. A municipality will default its payments if:it can still benefit from the services, especially when political pressures for competing expenditure arise. The main result is that the partnership sustainability depends on punishment mechanisms to a defaulting member, the gains from joint provision of services and the overall economic environment. Possible solutions to the incentive problem are discussed. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Ramirez, PG; Hachiya, T				Gonzalo Ramirez, Pablo; Hachiya, Toyohiko			HOW DO FIRM-SPECIFIC ORGANIZATIONAL CAPITAL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES AFFECT SALES, VALUE AND PRODUCTIVITY? EVIDENCE FROM JAPANESE FIRM-LEVEL DATA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Intangibles; organizational capital; productivity; market value		Over the past decades, the diffusion of new technological innovations has transformed the economies. In particular, the strategic emphasis shifted from efficient management of tangibles assets to innovation and effective usage of intangible assets. In this study we explore how the various combinations of sort of intangibles assets, like firm-specific organizational capital (FSOC), technology, brand, human and social capital affect the firm's corporate performance. The results suggest that regardless of the firms' type, those with higher stocks of FSOC, human and social capital outperform firms with higher stocks in only one dimension, suggesting a high degree of complementarity between them. The results also indicate that intangibles like FSOC and human and social capital are more likely to impact on productivity, whereas R&D and advertising are more likely to impact on the firm's value.

This article applies the dimension of recognition to business ethics. A case is made for normative stakeholder management as a voluntary commitment at the level of corporate leadership; this also meets management's strategic demands. A vitality criterion is offered as a heuristic instrument, suggesting that any operation should be avoided which would violate the legitimate interests of stakeholders. For this reason, the recognition of mutually-conditioned stakeholder claims is understood as the central management idea.

Shifting the focus from cost to value: A government perspective	JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE PHARMACY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th Annual Meeting of the Academy-of-Managed-Care-Pharmacy	APR   06, 2006	Seattle, WA	Acad Managed Care Pharm		healthy workforce; integrated health care; value; benchmarks; disability; prevention		OBJECTIVE: To examine the federal government's current health care initiatives in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to improve quality of care and cost-effectiveness around the prescription drug benefit. SUMMARY: The government has a unique perspective on quality and outcome. Pharmacists need a working knowledge of 3 areas: (1) Medicare Part D, (2) medication therapy management efforts, and (3) demonstration projects. All of these will make demands on health care providers but should result in better outcomes data and patient care. All of these areas also have value components, and all have strategic implications as 2006 moves into 2007. CONCLUSION: CMS does not consider managing cost and providing value to be mutually exclusive and is attempting to move America's health care toward a value-based program.

J	Gully, A; Stainer, L; Stainer, A				Gully, Alan; Stainer, Lorice; Stainer, Alan			Responsible business decisions: an over-arching framework	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS			English	Article								Contemporary businesses face increasing pressures on formulating, implementing and monitoring their strategic policies. Their long-term success in attaining these strongly relies on developing a proactive two-way, or even multi-way, stakeholder dialogue to become aware of the moral aspects of decisions. Openness and transparency should help to provide stakeholders with information on how and why particular courses of action have been adopted. In order to be effective and efficient, responsible business decision-making requires the willpower and commitment by management to implement, monitor and evaluate the ethical action which ought to be based on the organisation's evolving values and priorities. Although inclusive relationships may be accomplished in several ways, the normative interpretation of stakeholder theory is the most appropriate methodology to enable moral judgement to be made. An over-arching framework is presented to assess, review and re-balance the different techniques for any business to achieve its intended outcomes through the triple bottom line.

A dental workforce review for a Midlands Strategic Health Authority	BRITISH DENTAL JOURNAL			English	Article							PRACTITIONERS; ENGLAND	Objective To explore opportunities for workforce development in NHS general dental services (GDS) in Shropshire and Staffordshire. Method Secondary data sources were supplemented with a primary survey of GDS practices to build up a profile of the existing GDS workforce and its current capacity. Attitudes and perceptions on current workforce issues and potential solutions were gathered using a second survey and explored further through other qualitative techniques including interviews and a focus group discussion. Results The results confirm that there is a shortage of dentists in the area, fuelled by multiple factors including the move from NHS to private work, the decision to retire early and a growing disillusionment with NHS policies and remuneration. Modelling of alternate approaches to future dental clinical needs highlighted the opportunity for meeting the consequent workforce demands through increased involvement of hygienists and therapists. Conclusions This study has provided local evidence to inform dental service development in Shropshire and Staffordshire. It has provided a starting point for exploring new ways of working and will contribute towards a more effective implementation of new and evolving service strategies.

This increased cooperation is giving rise to a new type of interorganizational system (IOS). Before the advent of the Internet, IS integration required significant investments on the part of organizations participating in an IOS. Such heavy investments, in turn, necessitated close strategic cooperation in the non-IS domain, as well. Thus, IS integration went hand-in-hand with non-IS (relational) integration in the pre-Internet era. However, advances in Internet technology have commoditized IS integration to a significant extent, thereby allowing the uncoupling of IS integration and relational integration. It is now possible for organizations to have IS integration without developing strong non-IS linkages. We propose a framework to account for this recent shift and present a typology for classifying interorganizational systems based on the segregation of IS and relational integration. We also verify the typology in case studies of four large firms.

J	O'Byrne, SF; Young, SD				O'Byrne, Stephen F.; Young, S. David			Incentives and Investor Expectations	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CORPORATE FINANCE			English	Article								This article argues that the Expectations-Based Management (EBM) measure proposed by Copeland and Dolgoff (in the previous article) is essentially the same measure that EVA companies have used for years as the basis for performance evaluation and incentive compensation. After pointing out that the analyst-based measures cited by Copeland and Dolgoff do not provide a basis for a workable compensation plan, the authors present the outline of a widely used expectations-based EVA bonus plan. In so doing, they demonstrate the two key steps in designing such a plan: (1) using a company's "Future Growth Value"-the part of its current market value that cannot be accounted for by its current earnings-to calibrate the series of annual EVA "improvements" expected by the market; and (2) determining the executive's share of those improvements and thus of the company's expected "excess" return. One of the major objections to the use of EVA, or any single-period measure, as the basis for a performance evaluation and incentive comp plan is its inability to reflect the longer-run consequences of current investment and operating decisions. The authors close by presenting a solution to this "delayed productivity of capital" problem in the form of an internal accounting approach for dealing with acquisitions and other large strategic investments.

Planning a Reader-oriented Strategy for a Publishing Company: A Case Study	JOURNAL OF MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS			English	Article						reader satisfaction; quality management; MCDA		Scientific research in the sector of press readability and specifically magazines is not particularly extensive. This paper suggests a framework for the development of strategic decisions based on reader satisfaction measurements. The methodology is illustrated through a real-world application, i.e. customer-oriented strategy planning for the leading monthly IT magazine in Greece. This study implements the MUSA (Multicriteria Satisfaction Analysis) method to evaluate reader satisfaction, in order to support the editor in making decisions while planning his editorial strategy. Reader satisfaction was analysed based on a tree containing seven main criteria and 32 sub-criteria. Readers proved to be very satisfied and non-demanding, which results in narrower margins for efficient improvement suggestions. However, the evaluation of the MUSA results led to putting forward suggestions that could support the editor in making amendment decisions. Some of these suggestions were successfully implemented within the scope of a new strategy. This revealed the need for two separate editions, an IT magazine for pupils and students as well as an IT magazine focused on women. The decision maker received suggestions on what these new publications' features should be, deriving from the study's quantitative results. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Backman, M; Borjesson, S				Backman, Maria; Borjesson, Sofia			Vehicles for attention creation: the case of a concept car at Volvo Cars	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cars; Product development; Information media; Competitive strategy; Automotive industry	MANAGEMENT	Purpose - To present an example of a successful attention-generation strategy working with a win-win logic in media. Design/methodology/approach - The research is part of a broader collaborative research approach investigating new product development processes, comprising several different projects at Volvo Cars. The paper draws mainly on an ethnographic study in combination with an interview study around the project, but also on knowledge from a number of other studies of conceptual work at Volvo Cars which have provided the authors with in-depth contextual understanding of the practices in use. Findings - This paper presents the underlying logic when using and exploiting a media-attractive concept for attention-generating purposes. It describes how to intentionally generate attention in new ways; a media-attractive concept may deliberately be exploited to generate attention. The mutual dependence that is produced by media's own striving for attention from its audience and a company's striving for visibility can generate attention of a kind, span and duration beyond regular market activities. Research limitations/implications - The research is undertaken in the automotive industry. Practical implications - The paper presents an alternative approach to working with attention. As an example of how companies in competitive industries can learn from the attention industries, the paper illustrates a new breed of strategic tools that are increasingly important to consider as traditional tools become inadequate. Originality/value - The notion of attention has hitherto been used mainly for advertising purposes, or in the media business. This paper examines how attention can be consciously used in strategic work also for other companies.

J	Davis, JA; Marino, L; Aaron, J				Davis, Jullet A.; Marino, Louis; Aaron, Joshua			A real options perspective of platform investments in service firms An application in the nursing home industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Entrepreneurialism; Innovation; Nursing homes; United States of America		Purpose - Real options theory has been used to examine how manufacturing firms make incremental investments under conditions of uncertainty. However, it has not been extensively applied to service firms. Using real options theory, the purpose of this article is to explore how service firms make platform investments. Design/methodology/approach - Data come from a survey of Florida nursing homes. Several hypotheses examine the extent to which organizational characteristics, environmental scanning, internal and external slack, and entrepreneurial orientation impact the degree of investment in a portfolio of services to community based clients. Data were analyzed via ordinary least squares regression. Findings - Results indicate a positive relationship between platform investments and customer preferences and nursing home innovativeness. Risk-taking behavior and internal slack received mixed support. Research limitations/implications - The study did not include measures of economic performance; therefore, it is unclear if differences in market strategies yield better financial outcomes for the nursing homes. The study was set in the nursing home industry that is a highly regulated service industry. It is possible that specific attributes of this industry impacted our results. Practical implications - In deciding whether an options approach to managing customer value is appropriate for any individual service firms, managers should consider that a firm's strategic posture and the availability of slack resources. Originality/value - There has been relatively little research in the management literature that examines how firms in a service context employ strategies and tactics consistent with options theory to reduce uncertainty. This lack of research is problematic given that service firms compromise an increasing percentage of the GDP of many developed countries.

Therefore, common principles should be established throughout the construction industry, which flexibly support the management of construction project information and processes. New members should be supported to easily join and leave the project consortium while still using their own ICT-applications. The need to rapidly set up such organizational structures and effectively manage these collaborative networks places high demands on the methods and models that are used to establish a common, homogeneous project structure. Therefore, this article presents an architecture for dynamic cross-enterprise processes' planning, execution and controlling on a conceptual and application level. It is based on a Collaborative Business Process Management Lifecycle for virtual enterprises. For the adaptation of the architecture to the specific requirements of the AEC& FM-domain, a feasible Construction Network Scheme for the representation of strategic inter-organizational construction project information is introduced. Within this architecture, collaborative business process modeling will be achieved by the use of pre-defined process modules. Finally, the realization of the proposed models and methods are demonstrated in an example.

Investigating into IOKNs, first, an initial theoretical foundation is offered on the basis of the economics of knowledge and the organisational network approach. Subsequently, several hypotheses are derived concerning the use of the know ledge-output in this specific organisational mode. These are tested against the data obtained from a questionnaire Survey sent to 3,523 scientific and business addressees. The results show that regulations concerning the use of knowledge depend on the partner-structure and the kind of research performed in IOKNs. However, other theoretical predictions concerning the effects of the degree of diversity of the partners and the specific characteristics of knowledge on the rules for the use of the knowledge output could not be confirmed.

J	Lim, LC; Adair, A; McGreal, S; Webb, J				Lim, Lay Cheng; Adair, Alastair; McGreal, Stanley; Webb, James			Strategic management and operations of real estate valuation service providers in Hong Kong	JOURNAL OF PROPERTY INVESTMENT & FINANCE			English	Article						Real estate; Strategic management; Performance appraisal; China; Hong Kong		Purpose - The paper aims to contribute to the understanding of the current valuation practices and services offered across Asia, in particular the valuation techniques and methodology used by practising valuers in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach - In order to gain professional opinions and an in-depth understanding of Hong Kong valuation service providers, the methods and concepts used, and the extent of involvement with Chinese clients and businesses, the paper reports the findings of interviews with major real estate valuation firms and a survey of individual valuers involved in the appraisal of properties in Hong Kong and China. Findings - The results show that there are significant differences between the strategic management and the operational level across several facets of the valuation process in Hong Kong and China. The paper contributes to an understanding of behavioural influences within valuation. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation is the restriction of the survey on Hong Kong-based valuers. Further research will widen evidence to valuers based in mainland China. Originality/value - This paper presents the results of original empirical research utilising data drawn from interviews and survey questionnaires. The value of the work lies in the analysis of the strategic overview of the organisation, management and operation of appraisal practice in Hong Kong.

J	Lowe, DJ; Emsley, MW; Harding, A				Lowe, David; Emsley, Margaret; Harding, Anthony			Relationships between total construction cost and project strategic, site related and building definition variables	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF PROPERTY AND CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction cost; client costs; project strategic variables; site related variables; building definition variables		There is a paucity of recent literature on the influence of project strategic, site related and design related variables on the cost of construction. This paper seeks to redress this omission by presenting the results of an investigation into the influence of 41 independent variables on both construction cost and client cost. Data were collected from 286 construction projects in the United Kingdom and correlation and test for differences were used to determine the relationships that exist between the dependent and independent variables. The analysis both confirms the strong relationship between construction cost and client cost and between those two measures of cost and GIFA, and establishes other relationships which exist within the data, confirming many of the relationships that had been anticipated from the literature. It also established the ordinal sequence of several nominal variables. These data, therefore, can be confidently used to develop models of the total cost of construction.

J	Perez, AMG; Fumero, MAS; Oreja Rodriguez, JR				Perez, Ana M. Garcia; Fumero, M. Angeles Sanfiel; Oreja Rodriguez, Juan Ramon			Size and interorganisational relationships in the Canary Islands' food industry - From confrontation to collaboration	BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL			English	Article						food industry; value chain; channel relationships; resource management; Spain	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; ORGANIZATION; COOPERATION	Purpose - The objective of this study is to identify firms with a greater propensity to establish interorganisational relationships, as well as which value-chain activities are affected by these relationships in the Canary Islands' food industry. Design/methodology/approach - The firms are grouped into large firms and small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), given the different resource endowments and dependencies of these two groups. Differences in the degree of flexibility or rigidity of their interorganisational relationships and in the activities affected by these relationships were expected. The fieldwork used a survey of the managers of a representative sample of 201 food firms, and univariate analysis statistical techniques were used to handle the data. Findings - The paper finds that only 53 sample firms have developed interorganisational relationships, and 62.5 per cent of these are large firms. The flexible interorganisational link predominates. With regard to the value-chain activities affected by these relationships, the most prominent are distribution and supplies, although size only has a statistically significant relation with some support activities. Research limitations/implications - The small proportion of food firms that have carried out interorganisational links in the Canaries means that the findings obtained cannot be entirely generalisable to the rest of the firms in the sector. Practical implications - Most studies of the food industry take a macroeconomic approach, and research taking a strategic and interorganisational perspective is scarce. Originality/value - This type of study centring on this particular strategic behaviour has not been carried out before in the Canary Islands.

P.; van Oudtshoorn, Rheede			A meta-theoretical glimpse into the future of South African corporate communication management	COMMUNICATIO-SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL FOR COMMUNICATION THEORY AND RESEARCH			English	Article							PUBLIC-RELATIONS	This article provides a concise discussion of meta-theoretical (critical-rhetorical, feminist and postmodernistic) approaches towards corporate communication management utilising meta-ethical points of departure with the aim of providing a glimpse into the meta-theoretical future of corporate communication management. The discussion is supplemented by an analysis of the challenges that face organisations in the fast-changing environment of the twenty-first century and corporate communication management as a critical/strategic management function that has the potential to assist organisations in adapting and remaining relevant to their environment, and by implication to the needs of their key internal and external stakeholders. The article is concluded by an explication of corporate communication management as being inextricably linked to ethical conduct and a product of the amalgamation of different meta-theoretical approaches, which interprets and advances the values of both stakeholders and the organisation in a manner that socially and ethically responsible, dialogical mutually adaptive, and contributes to democratising the organisation's decision-making and management processes. This poses challenges to, and insight into, the meta-theoretical approach held while engaging in discourse on the comprehensive nature of corporate communication management.

Transparency: panacea or Pandora's box	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Strategic management; Governance; Volatility		Purpose - The purpose of this article is to share with executives, public policy makers, and securities analysts some key behavior constraints on transparency seldom addressed in the professional literature. Focus is on unexpected and perhaps counterintuitive issues of transparency and full disclosure. Design/methodology/approach - Recent contributions from management research are presented to inform behavioral constraints on transparency and full disclosure. A number of studies are reported including research on the herd instinct in market volatility, the private information paradox in competitive strategy, insider trading in technology-intensive companies, symbolic corporate governance reform, and attribution theory and corporate responsibility. Findings - Executives, public policy makers, and securities analysts should focus on the latest research that impacts their duties. Originality/value - The paper reports new research which questions "conventional wisdom" that there are few, if any, negative aspects to transparency and full disclosure.

J	Merchant, H				Merchant, H			Efficient resources, industry membership, and shareholder value creation: The case of international joint ventures	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES-REVUE CANADIENNE DES SCIENCES DE L ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						competition and firm performance; international joint ventures; industrial organization and resource-based view(s)	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; USEFUL PERSPECTIVE; STOCK-MARKET; FIRM; VIEW	This study extends previous work on international joint ventures (IJVs) by investigating the role of industry conditions vis-a-vis shareholder value creation in these ventures' American parents. More importantly, the study argues that although industry membership influences firms' economic performance, it is at least as useful to also focus on firm-level indicators of such membership. This is because firms, even those within the same industry, differ in terms of resources with a potential for creating sustainable competitive advantage. Indeed, the study submits that both levels of factors must be jointly examined to derive a better understanding of shareholder value creation via IJVs. Using a multi-industry sample of more than 400 equity IJVs, this study demonstrates the interrelatedness between industry structure and resource-based views. The results of moderated hierarchical regression analysis validate the above-mentioned thesis and support two of the study's three hypotheses.

Guerra, agreed to facilitate the process. The MAPP process provided the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District, the local public health authority, a defined process for community health improvement, as well as a mechanism to help bridge the gap between public health and the community. The San Antonio Metropolitan Health District organized a Core Planning Team to lead the MAPP process in April 2001. By October 2002, the Core Planning Team was expanded to a full community working group named the Alliance for Community Health in San Antonio and Bexar County (Alliance). The Alliance identified six strategic issues, which eventually became the basis of the San Antonio Community Health Improvement Plan. The strategic issues are Public Policy, Data Tracking, Healthy Lifestyles, Promoting a Sense of Community, Access to Care, and Safe Environment. San Antonio's MAPP experience has been successful in bringing together the public health system partners, and establishing public health priorities collectively. The MAPP process has resulted in the development of many new initiatives, and, most important, has opened the door to many partnership opportunities in the future. The work of the Alliance, through the MAPP process, has helped to leverage resources for public health improvement in San Antonio, and has the potential to effect positive change in public health in the future.

J	Warner, AG				Warner, Alfred G.			AN EGG-CENTRIC APPROACH TO TEACHING STRATEGIC TYPES: ADAPTING A CLASSIC EXERCISE	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION			English	Article						games; strategy; resources; group activities		This article introduces a variation on the egg-drop exercise to generate active understanding of strategic choice by firms. Teams are challenged to design, build, and price devices for protecting an egg from a 20-foot drop. The materials are purchased in a bidding process that builds in asymmetries in resources, costs, and finished designs. Teams price their products to reflect their knowledge of the marketplace and what they believe is required to win the contest if their design successfully passes the drop test.

J	Thomas, T				Thomas, T			Guidance scheme for solid propelled vehicle during atmospheric phase	DEFENCE SCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	National Workshop on Tactical Missile Guidance	MAR, 2004	Hyderabad, INDIA	Def Res & Dev Lab		long-range missiles; missile guidance schemes; launch vehicle; ballistic missiles; energy management guidance scheme; atmospheric phase		Strategic ballistic missiles are the long-range missiles designed to intercept stationary, defined targets. Guidance is in the boost phase which represents only a small fraction of the total time of flight of the missile. A missile has to be guided and steered to the required position and velocity states at the end of the boost phase. The problem of guiding a vehicle in atmospheric phase in the presence of drag and lift, poses a challenge for the designer. This paper describes an energy management guidance scheme for guiding the vehicle in atmospheric phase of the flight. The estimated drag is taken care of by the guidance scheme. Uncertainty in velocity due to drag or impulse variation at the end of the boost phase are corrected by an augmented velocity package. A closed-loop guidance scheme has been used during this phase also. A ballistic re-entry has been considered for this design study.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategy; policy; innovation		Organizations are looking for new ways to compete within increasingly turbulent business environments. At the macro level, governments are challenged to develop strategic innovation policies that seek to support business competitiveness in this new era. At the same time at a micro level, companies are struggling to re-orientate themselves and become strategically innovative so that they can effectively overcome threats presented by, for example, new emerging low wage economies. This paper aims to develop a clearer understanding of the interface between innovation policy at a macro (regional) level and strategic innovation development at an organizational (micro) level.

J	Paris, FM				Paris, FM			Selecting an optimal portfolio of consumer loans by applying the state preference approach	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						banking; state preference theory; portfolio theory; consumer loans; probability distribution		Internal models like CreditMetrics and KMV, implemented by banks to manage credit risk and assess regulatory capital, are significant examples of how practitioners apply modern portfolio theory (MPT) to the management of bank loan-portfolios. From a theoretical perspective there are several reasons suggesting to be careful in extending MPT to the case of bank loan-portfolios selection in order to avoid misleading results. Specifically, loans' log-returns are non-normally distributed random variables, furthermore, decision-makers not necessarily perform a quadratic utility function. Because both of those reasons the traditional mean-variance approach is inadequate in building up optimal loan-portfolios. Such a conclusion is even more relevant if specific categories of loans are considered. In our paper we deal with the problem of selecting optimal portfolios of consumer-loans by developing a state preference model. It allows us not to explicitly consider the distributional properties of loans' log-returns. The model is a static one having the objective to select the loan-portfolio maximizing the expected utility of wealth allocated by the bank managers, subject to a number of constraints accounting for fundamental strategic choices implemented by the bank managers. Our results show that flexibility is the main characteristic of our model. In fact, adding constraints gives new optimal portfolios without reducing the expected utility of the decision maker. We will explain that such a result does not depend on constraints' misspecification but on the risk structure implied in the state preference approach. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Jaques, T				Jaques, Tony			Systematic objective setting for effective issue management	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS			English	Article								While a great deal of academic and practitioner effort has been devoted to understanding and formalizing objective setting in corporate strategic planning and in strategic communication, far less effort has been committed to objective setting for issue management. Within this context, setting a proper objective is sometimes swept aside in the 'rush for results' and, as a consequence, issue management efforts can be misdirected, misapplied and poorly evaluated. Objective setting for issue management has unique requirements which distinguish it from broader corporate planning processes, and this paper develops a rationale and proposes specific guidelines to help to establish strategic objectives for effective issue management.

J	Bailey, N				Bailey, Nick			Transformation or Bureaucratization? The Changing Role of Community Representation in Local Strategic Partnerships in England	JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY			English	Article						Community representation; urban regeneration; Local Strategic Partnerships		The debate about the need to build social capital and to engage local communities in public policy has become a central issue in many advanced liberal societies and developing countries. In many countries new forms of governance have emerged out of a growing realization that representative democracy by itself is no longer sufficient. One of the most significant public policy trends in the United Kingdom has been the involvement of community organizations and their members in the delivery of national policy, mediated through local systems of governance and management. One such policy area is urban regeneration. Central Government now requires local authorities in England to set up Local Strategic Partnerships (LSPs) to bring together stakeholders who can prepare Community Strategies and deliver social and economic programmes which target areas of deprivation. This paper reviews the key institutional processes which must be addressed, such as representation, accountability and transformation. It then investigates three very different examples of LSPs based on interviews with key representatives. The paper concludes that political commitments to community engagement in civil society are always mediated through existing institutional arrangements. Thus attempts to change deep-seated political structures and power relationships require a commitment to increase representation as well as to transform the practices and repertoires of deliberation and action.

Might the effectiveness of such procedures improve with practice? This longitudinal experiment investigated the efficiency, effectiveness and group member perceptions of dialectical inquiry (DI) and constructive consensus (CC) approaches to strategic decision making in a virtual (distributed) Computer-Mediated-Communications (CMC) environment. There were no differences between DI and CC groups in terms of decision effectiveness. However, this result has not been unusual in CMC research. DI groups had significantly higher perceived depth of evaluation than CC groups. CC groups reported greater decision acceptance and willingness to work together again than DI groups. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for Group Support Systems research and design in the era of the World Wide Web.

J	Garrido-Rubio, A; Polo-Redondo, Y				Garrido-Rubio, Ana; Polo-Redondo, Yolanda			Tactical launch decisions: influence on innovation success/failure	JOURNAL OF PRODUCT AND BRAND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Product launch; Product management		Purpose - Innovation launch strategies are usually critical for innovation success. The main objective of this work consists of analysing the influence of the tactical launch decisions on new product performance Design/methodology/approach - Starts with a brief literature review. Then the results obtained in our study are compared with those obtained in other research. The data used in our research describes a new product launch in the Spanish agro-food sector. The method for collecting the information was through a mailed questionnaire. Because most of response variables were categorical, and in order to verify the proposed hypotheses, cross tabulation was used. We used Pearson's chi-squared (x(2)), likelihood ratio (H-2) and the adjusted residuals too. Findings - The results propose a series of recommendations for the executives in charge of marketing new products. Specifically, suggests that it will be more likely to achieve success if, when launching a new product, skimming strategies are used, if intensive distribution is used for selling an innovation and the investment in the communication media is greater than that made by competitors. However, it is more possible to fail if the new product is marketed using an individual brand, penetration prices, push communication strategies and less expenditure on this concept than the competitors. Research limitations/implications - The literature review suggests that some of these tactical decisions seem to be related with other launch decisions (strategic launch decisions). As a result of this, it will be interesting to perform these similar analyses for those as well as to analyse the possible links that may exist between both and their influence on the results. Future research could explore these relationships in other industrial sector or countries. Perhaps, it would be possible provide a common perspective. Originality/value - In spite of the importance of the last phase of new product, there are few empirical works about it. This work tries to explain the transcendence of the tactical launch decisions and the influence of it on the success/failure of an innovation	[Garrido-Rubio, Ana; Polo-Redondo, Yolanda] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Management & Mkt, Zaragoza, Spain		Garrido-Rubio, A (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Dept Management & Mkt, Zaragoza, Spain.

The authors developed an electronic relationship marketing (e-RM) framework and investigated the website features of 91 hospitality and tourism programs in the US. The results indicated that, while there was a preliminary effort of using program websites to facilitate the relationship with prospective students, sophisticated utilization of the Internet technologies for higher-level relationships presented a major challenge to the program marketers and administrators. In general, more advanced applications of e-RM-oriented features were found in websites maintained by large or public programs than by their counterparts. The main reasons for this phenomenon may be that small or private programs lack resource commitment and insufficient strategic planning prior to their website constructions.

J	Henderson, J; McAdam, R; Parkinson, S				Henderson, J; McAdam, R; Parkinson, S			An innovative approach to evaluating organisational change	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Information Technology; evaluation; evaluation methodology; organisational decision-making; learning		This paper addresses the difficult problem of how to improve the process of evaluating organisational change. Given that the data emergent from an evaluative exercise will strongly influence the subsequent strategic and operational decisions taken by organisational managers, it is critical that the evaluation approach itself is capable of delivering high quality, accurate and timely data. The aim of this paper is to examine the role of the IT-based Optionfinder Technology used in conjunction with focus groups, in generating management decision-making data, and reflecting the changes in key performance indicators in a utility organisation. The case study research evaluates the innovative integrative approach adopted by the utility organisation and concludes that the proposed approach contributes to improvements in the decision-making capability of managers.

J	Janev, V; Vranes, S				Janev, V; Vranes, S			The role of knowledge management solutions in enterprise business processes	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Knowledge Management	JUN 30-JUL 02, 2004	Graz, AUSTRIA			knowledge management; business process; enterprises; software tools; market research		Knowledge technologies, the software products that support all aspects of knowledge processing and exchange, are the subject of permanent interest for software engineers at research organizations, as well as, for market analysts in commercial organizations. In order to clarify the role of knowledge management solutions in an enterprise business process, in this paper we survey the market of knowledge management solutions and analyze their functionalities from operational and strategic business perspective. Although knowledge flows are identified on an operational level, discussion will show that knowledge management solutions here serve to utilize the enterprise knowledge in an efficient performance of daily work. We argue that data and information collected on the operational level are processed by knowledge management solutions on a strategic level thus creating new knowledge that is used for strategic management of customers, suppliers and partners. This paper gives an insight into knowledge management market that can help the strategic planners to easily begin a knowledge management initiative.

Addressing uncertainty and inequality in nuclear policy	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Decision making; Nuclear energy industry; Risk assessment; Sustainable development		Purpose - This paper analyses the justification of technological choices and options in the context of nuclear energy policy. We argue that "society" increasingly demands a justification with regard to the level of uncertainty and inequality a certain technological choice induces. We aim to demonstrate that policy makers in fact do address these issues, but depending on how they define the problem, this is done in a more explicit (overt) or implicit (covert) way. Design/methodology/approach - First, the changing context with regard to the justification of technological choices is briefly sketched. We draw the attention to the link between the way a certain (energy) policy problem is defined, and the way the framework for political decision-making is set up in response to the problem. In order to clarify this observation, we make use of a scheme derived from policy sciences, mapping out policy problems in two dimensions: the (lack of) certainty concerning the kinds of knowledge a problem may require, and the (lack of) consensus on relevant values ( i. e."the common good", "basic rights", etc.). Each type of policy problem requires a distinct solution strategy. A so-called Type III-error occurs when the wrong problem is solved by employing a strategy which does not apply to the problem at hand. In that case, political theory predicts strategic behavior in order to actively suppress or blur value differences. The Belgian decision to phase out nuclear power is used as a case study to illustrate some of the theoretical implications of the scheme. Findings - Several Type III-errors could be demonstrated in the case of the Belgian phase out. In this case, social learning was severely hampered by different methodological approaches; lack of data; different perceptions of relevant time scales; different framing of the problem; institutional barriers; lack of communication; strategic use of scientific assessments by different stakeholders; and insufficient knowledge of scientific assessments. Originality/value - The paper aims to broaden the debate on energy policy outside the boundaries of institutional decision-making. We conclude with some practical recommendations for future energy policy, regarding problem structuring, defining possible options, goal and strategy formulation and monitoring of choices.

J	Lane, N				Lane, Nikala			Strategy implementation: the implications of a gender perspective for change management	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						Strategy implementation; gender; behaviour-based control; sales management; relational selling		The implementation of strategic marketing plans remains an elusive goal for many organisations with many managers knowing what to do but not how to do it. A relevant question relating to the implementation capabilities of managers regards the characteristics of successful implementors. This question highlights several interesting issues, including the impact of manager gender. The current paper reveals the role of female managers in implementing new management techniques in sales organisations - namely, the introduction of behaviour-based management control strategies as an indicator of a possible gender dimension in more general implementation capabilities. We summarise the findings from single company and multi-company studies where the implementation capabilities of male and female field sales managers are examined. The provocative conclusion is that superior implementation capabilities are shown by female sales managers in the implementation of behaviour-based control strategies. We suggest this finding may provide insight into implementation capabilities in strategic marketing and more generally.

This article evaluates the 'survivor syndrome' and assesses the impact of the process of downsizing and transformation on communication, trust, survivor commitment and loyalty, morale and career advancement opportunities. The study was conducted using a stratified random sample of 361 employees/survivors in a branch of a motor manufacturer that had undergone major transformation. Data was collected using a self-developed questionnaire and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The study generates a framework/model of critical change implementation factors and recommendations that will enable change managers to sense, adjust, respond and implement change timeously so as to gain strategic and competitive advantage.

J	Parkan, C				Parkan, Celik			Benchmarking operational performance: the case of two hotels	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Productivity rate; Competitive advantage; Performance measurement (quality); Competitive analysis		Purpose - To present an actual case study that was carried out to investigate and benchmark the operational performances of two hotels in a large city. Design/methodology/approach - The study involves the comparison of the hotels' performances with each other as well as their respective benchmarks on the basis of data on monthly costs and revenues. The benchmark operations are stated in terms of target costs and revenues that are derived from industry standards for comparable hotels and corporate strategic goals. For performance measurement a new non-parametric performance measurement method called Operational Competitiveness Rating Analysis (OCRA) is used for its relative simplicity, flexibility, and ability to allow for differences in hotels' guest profiles and competitive priorities. Findings - The areas of strength and weakness are revealed in the measured performances of the two hotels' operations. While the hotels' performances converge near the end of the study period, they both fall short of reaching their respective benchmark performance levels. This may be partly due to benchmark cost/revenue levels being set unrealistically high. OCRA is shown to be an appropriate tool for measuring and comparing hotels' operational performance. Research limitations/implications - While OCRA can also incorporate the intangible dimensions of performance, this study has not taken into consideration the quality dimension of hotel performance. Practical implications - It is shown that a service operation's performance can be profiled and benchmarked using cost/revenue data. Originality/value - This paper demonstrates a flexible approach to measuring operational performance in service organizations, which can be used by non-specialists.

J	Sadler, I; Gough, R				Sadler, Ian; Gough, Richard			Applying a strategic planning process to several supply chain partners	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic planning; Supply chain management; Operations management; Action research		Purpose - The ability of a team from a manufacturer and its partners to formulate strategic plans for supply chains is investigated. The research aims to improve the process of formulate strategic plans for supply chains is investigated. The research aims to improve the process of formulation using the strategic operations and logistics planning (SOLP) process. Design/methodology/approach - SOLP involves researchers facilitating many meetings of the planning team in an action research setting at their premises. Combining knowledge from operations strategy and socio-technical systems (STS), participant observation and semi-structured surveys are used to obtain rich data. Team members derive order-winning criteria and design policies along the supply chain for several product groups, using the process to craft strategies whilst researchers study it. One application included managers from supply chain partners whilst the other was limited to manufacturer managers. Working within the corporate plans of the focal company, the formulation is carried out by middle managers. Findings - Carrying out the process twice at a heavy fabrication business (HFB) in Australia demonstrated that a team of chain managers can formulate strategic operations plans for a complete heavy industry chain. Extensive support, in the form of worksheets and facilitation, is important to formulation and extent of implementation of the plans. A case is made that assistance is probably necessary for full implementation of those plans. Research limitations/implications - Whilst limited to cases in a heavy manufacturer, the research is believed to be applicable to a range of medium-sized supply chains. Practical implications - The need for the team to include supply chain partners and the effect of member's capability and authority is investigated. The extent of implementation and the effect of team attributes on execution is studied. Originality/value - The research demonstrates that a team of chain managers can, with suitable support, formulate strategic operations plans for a complete heavy industry chain. The case sheds some light on the benefits, or drawbacks, of having members of other chain partners present.

J	Savigny, H				Savigny, Heather			Labour, Political Marketing and the 2005 Election: A Campaign of Two Halves	JOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						political marketing; 2005 election campaign; strategic targeting		Labour's 2005 election campaign was extensively underpinned by political marketing. This resulted in a campaign of unequal halves; generic and populist at national level; focused and individualised at local level. This article describes the text of Labour's campaign, and its response to its environment, focusing upon its image management strategies in response to the political and media environment within which it operated. This also included the Conservatives and an increasing overlap between politics and celebrity culture. This campaign saw a continuation and sophistication of marketing strategies and technologies, enabling parties to target individual, strategically important, voters. A specific personalised message was presented to 2% of the electorate, while a broad image was promoted to the rest of the populace. With an election focused on a targeted minority of the electorate, it is argued that far from being a force to enhance democracy, marketing at the 2005 election challenges the ideals upon which the democratic process of politics is premised.

In early 1999, a supply chain optimization review recommended an enterprise system (ES) implementation to provide better control and reporting of organizational finances. The focus of this case is the IT platform decision made in conjunction with the ES implementation process. This decision was thoroughly considered by all Health Board stakeholders and the final choice was made in alignment with the Board's strategic IT policy. Nevertheless, initial testing two months prior to go-live revealed major performance problems with the new system. The case documents the events that led up to the selection of the original IT platform and the challenges the project team faced in deciding what to do when the platform did not meet contractual specifications.

J	Tan, KH; Platts, K				Tan, Kim Hua; Platts, Ken			Effective strategic action planning: a process and tool	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Strategic manufacturing; Planning		Purpose - This paper aims to describe an interactive action planning software tool (TAPS) for manufacturing objective deployment, and to report the results of its application in five companies. Design/methodology/approach - A process approach based on action research was adopted in this research. Under this approach, a series of four to five workshops were conducted in each company. Each workshop took half a day and involved a multi-disciplinary team of four to six managers. Besides direct observation in the workshops, a structured questionnaire was also used to elicit managers' feedback at the end of each workshop. Findings - The TAPS approach (integration of Burbidge's connectance concept and the analytic hierarchy process) helps managers to visualise and represent their perceptions of the relationships between variables and objectives through a sequential, analytical process. Results from the case studies indicate that TAPS provides the following benefits to managers: it improves collective understanding, reduces the complexity of strategy deployment into manageable steps, facilitates discussion, and manages organizational knowledge. Research limitations/implications - The research is so far limited to application in five case studies. Future research will involve further cases and improvements to the usability of the software tool. Originality/value - For practitioners, the paper provides them with an interactive software tool (TAPS) for effective strategic action planning. For academics, this paper provides an approach for researching strategy deployment, and a potential classroom teaching tool for operations management.

We develop a novel framework for automatically generating the domain knowledge by analyzing different Web sites in a given domain. The idea of our approach is to consider two kinds of information from the Web sites. The first kind of information is the text fragments corresponding to the concepts in the ontology. The other kind of information is the header labels corresponding to the concepts. We design a method for generating the domain ontology by measuring the similarity between the concepts in different Web sites. We have conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

RCO is a patented system of planning under uncertainty that searches for the most acceptable compromise between improving results and reducing risk in our decisions. Risk management and scenario planning dominate over optimization. RCO still uses maximization, but only in combination with several protective filters that screen, modify, and scale back the strategies, as necessary. As with any protective equipment, RCO could reduce the need for knowledge about the future.

J	Novotny, JM; Donahue, M; Bhalla, BB				Novotny, JM; Donahue, M; Bhalla, BB			The clinical partnership as strategic alliance	JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL NURSING			English	Article						partnership; alliance; nursing shortage; faculty shortage; finance		The purpose of this article is to describe a renewed partnership between a collegiate school of nursing and a community hospital. Universities and hospitals are searching for creative solutions to increase the number of registered nurses available to meet the demand for nursing care. An affiliation agreement had been in existence for many years, but health care system imperatives made it necessary to redesign the partnership between nursing education and nursing service. The model used to develop this new partnership is based on the work done in the field of management and is in the form of a strategic alliance. The success of a strategic alliance depends on two key factors: the relationship between partners and partnership performance. Identified outcomes show that this partnership is helping to meet the increasing demand for nursing care by building student capacity, satisfying mutual needs of faculty and clinical staff, and removing economic barriers. This article describes the development of the strategic alliance, its current status, and strategies for the future. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This article proceeds from the premise that leadership effectiveness also requires a deeper understanding of self-the inner dimension of leadership. Specifically, the authors (1) trace the evolutionary design of an NTL Institute workshop and the learning from facilitating individual self-awareness and the resolution of behavioral patterns blocking personal leadership effectiveness and (2) provide exemplars of how self-awareness can be incorporated into leadership development programs. However, the authors also raise questions about the willingness of organizations to invest in the integration of externally focused skill development with personal introspection and change.

J	Bughin, J				Bughin, J			"Attack or convert?": early evidence from European on-line banking	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						e-commerce; on-line banking		Why are so many on-line banking ventures-start-ups and incumbents alike-foundering? An industry which can theoretically conduct such a high proportion of its transactions electronically would seem well suited to a rapid move on-line. Yet, the rate at which customers around the world are adopting Internet banking remains relatively low; and furthermore the capability to convert or acquire customers on-line varies enormously among banks. This paper attempts to analyze and compare possible drivers of customer acquisition and conversion for European on-line banking at the light of various theories of bank innovations. The econometric model is consistent with "pull" market features playing a significant role, but only for customer conversion. In contrast, bank-specific factors are largely the driver for on-line customer acquisition strategy, especially organizational link to on-line activities and bank size. All in all, this paper confirms that, consistent with the strategic management literature, an "attacker" versus "conversion" strategy obeys significantly different paths, but also that some banks are notably better in executing their strategy than others, on-line.

However, no major study has investigated possible antecedent effects related to SCAPs. We propose and test a model of three environmental indirect effects operating through two mediating variables that affect the firm's likelihood to issue SCAPs. The results show that the three environment factors-industry antitrust activity, industry dynamism, and competitor retaliation-affect either customer's tendency to engage in select channel arrangements or the selling firm's reputation-building activities (or both), which in turn affect the firm's likelihood to issue SCAPs.

(1991). The major findings are as follows. (1) If all consumers prefer the domestic good, then "buy domestic" campaigns will decrease the prohibitive tariff rate and increase local welfare. (2) If at least some consumers prefer the foreign good, but not to a great extent, then "buy domestic" campaigns will not change the optimal tariff rate, but may improve local welfare. (3) When all consumers greatly prefer the foreign good, then promotion of "buy domestic" decreases the optimal tariff rate, but it cannot improve social welfare. With this framework, we also prove that "buy domestic" campaigns serve as a substitute for tariffs with respect to a strategic trade policy.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on the Public-Private Partnership in the Middle east and North Africa	NOV 01-03, 2002	CAIRO, EGYPT					The paper considers the current guidelines and orientations of the Moroccan public authorities, which are converging towards the increasing disengagement of the state in terms of the finance and management of infrastructures. In addition, with a view to the will of the public authorities to attract foreign investments deemed to be a true vector of economic development, the paper sheds light on those recent changes that have affected the water and sanitation sector in Morocco through the analysis of the concept of public-private partnership in so far as the following are concerned: the drinking water and sanitation sector; the strategic features of the drinking water and sanitation industry, and the formulation of a development strategy of public-private partnership in the drinking water and sanitation sector.

J	Bridges, E; Ensor, KB; Raman, K				Bridges, E; Ensor, KB; Raman, K			The impact of need frequency on service marketing strategy	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article							DIFFUSION; MODELS; UNCERTAINTY; ADOPTION; PRICE	Strategic marketing decisions for services are complicated by factors that distinguish services from goods. Because services are intangible, variable, and the production and consumption experiences are inseparable, trial of the identical service to be purchased cannot be offered. Services cannot be inventoried, so potential customers are lost if they are unaware of a particular service or it is unavailable during their time of need. Partially due to the difficulty of matching service supply to demand, service marketers typically assume that it is best to work toward retaining current clients, rather than focusing too much an attracting new customers. If there is an ongoing or frequent periodic need for the service, it may indeed be less expensive to maintain an existing customer relationship than to build a new one: however for services that customers require infrequently, the marketer must find ways to build awareness and attract new customers. Just as marketing strategies, for manufactured goods depend on whether the items are frequently purchased or durable, more e effective service marketing decisions may be obtained by considering whether customer needs are frequent or not. We discuss these differences in general terms, then provide an application, developing an optimal promotion strategy decision model for an infrequently purchased service. We conclude that customers in the market for infrequently purchased services have particularly high needs for product awareness and purchase risk reduction, influencing strategic marketing decisions,	Kent State Univ, Dept Mkt, Kent, OH 44242 USA; Rice Univ, Dept Stat, Houston, TX 77251 USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Management, Flint, MI 48503 USA		Bridges, E (corresponding author), Kent State Univ, Dept Mkt, Kent, OH 44242 USA.

J	Pajares, J; Lopez, A; Hernandez, C				Pajares, J; Lopez, A; Hernandez, C			Industry as an organisation of agents: Innovation and R&D management	JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION			English	Article						cognitive evolutionary models; computational organization; industrial dynamics; multiagent systems		We present a model of the dynamics of the industry for innovation and R&D management. It is a novel view of the evolution of industry, both in theoretical and computational terms. Industries are seen as organisations of firms and consumers, and the aggregated behaviour is the consequence of the decisions taken by the individual firms. A multi-agent system is designed and programmed to model the industry. The agents are the individual firms and the consumers are represented by the group demands for two products: a new and an old one. The strategic decisions of the firms are the patterns of investment in process and product innovation, and whether to stay or to leave the industry. Agents information and incentives in terms of assets returns are specified. Co-ordination is embedded into the model. We include in the model the relevant ideas from evolutionary economics in the product life cycle context. The model is used to explain and to reproduce the main observed facts in life cycle dynamics, in terms of the rise and fall of incumbent firms, concentration ratios, R&D expenditure and path-dependence in the evolution of the industry. Thus showing the utility of MAS in industrial evolutionary modeling and policy assessment.

J	St John, CH; Pouder, RW; Cannon, AR				St John, CH; Pouder, RW; Cannon, AR			Environmental uncertainty and product-process life cycles: A multi-level interpretation of change over time	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article							DOMINANT DESIGNS; TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; STRATEGIC CHOICE; INNOVATION; ORGANIZATIONS; MODEL; FIRMS; INDUSTRY; ISOMORPHISM; PERFORMANCE	Product-process life cycle models are often used to describe long-term change in organizations. Such models generally assume a deterministic trajectory of long-run industry evolution and production core transformation that lead to standardization over time. Typical interpretations of these-models do not explain the short and intermediate term choices and competitive dynamics that lead to the longer-term changes, or explain viable 'off-trajectory' positions and post-stabilization complications that can arise. In this paper, we use multiple theory streams to augment discussions of product-process life cycle models in ways that allow interpretation of the role of uncertainty and management decision-making for the typical trajectory of standardization as well as off-trajectory and post-standardization phases.

The use of the Internet as a tool in the delivery of UHCs products and services has increased dramatically over the past year and will continue to increase during the foreseeable future. This paper examines the current state of UHC-member institution driven tools and services that utilize the Web as a fundamental component in their delivery. The evolution of knowledge management at UHC, its management information and reporting tools, and expansion of e-commerce provide real world examples of Internet use in health care delivery and management. Health care workers are using these Web-based tools to help manage rising costs and optimize patient outcomes. Policy, technical, and organizational issues must be resolved to facilitate rapid adoption of Internet applications.

J	Hunkeler, D				Hunkeler, D			Selective multinationality - How environmental management helps high-tech SMES identify high-growth, low-risk markets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT			English	Article								Background. Small and medium sized enterprises in developed regions, as well as larger 'Southern' firms are more exposed to risk in regards to allocation decisions. This includes expenditures on fixed as sets, R&D and environmental management, as well as the choice of suitable markets for the product or service at hand. For either type of firm, the consequences of not selecting, or timing, suitable markets can lead to bankruptcy. Objectives. This paper examines means for SMEs to expand internationally given the current fiscal climate, and rapid advances in certain enabling technologies. The goal is to identify a set of criteria which smaller firms can use to globalize which reduce risk and increase access to capital. Methods. Case studies are presented of a European Start-Up as well as a century-old Latin American firm, both in the water-treatment sector. The similarities in the risk-reward profiles are used to identify some key strategic guidelines for enterprises wishing to be, selectively, multinational. Results and Discussion. Selective multinationality is an immediate plan for international expansion which identifies the most appropriate markets, independent of their proximity to the firm's production base or headquarters. At the base of selective multinationality, is the goal to impose the firm's product in regions of high growth, high selling price and low risk of price dumping. Therefore, this requires the to resist the temptation to expand to markets based on merely geographical proximity. The globalization strategy should be established, along with environmental management, from the outset of the creation of the firm. It will be shown, herein, to be a key driver in the valuation of High Tech industrial SMEs, in particular those with high risk-high reward tradeoffs. Selective multinationality can best be implemented if the firm in question has a technology which addresses unmet needs in niche markets, where there is an expanding customer base focusing on client relationships and cost effectiveness, and where the multinationals enter from outside the sector via resellers. It will be demonstrated to be effective for startups from developed regions, as well as SMEs from developing/emerging countries, to both of whom the consequences of sub-optimal resource allocation can risk the future of the firm itself. Therefore, SMEs can, with appropriate planning and the integration of marketing and environmental strategies, become, selectively, global firms, with better credit access and sales growth, concomitant with lower risks. The High Tech industrial SME will succeed better if, from the outset, they behave like the organization they want to become, with globalization a key element of strategy, from the business plan foreword. Two case studies are presented, one documenting the water sector and the other the cost savings possible by integrating environmental management into the firm's strategy.

A comprehensive methodology has been developed to assess these risks, but it has not yet been extensively applied in the health sector. Until now, health has appropriately concentrated on the detection and reduction of clinical incidents in established services. However, there is strategic value in looking more broadly at the process of risk management. This is relevant to risk management in telemedicine.

J	Rothstein, E				Rothstein, E			Development of a strategic plan: Portfolio management for public utilities	JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION			English	Article								This article provides utility, managers with guidance to be used in developing strategic planning processes that. can, be integrated in a utility's annual planning cycle. The processes discussed will also help define strategies that are useful in a rapidly changing and highly,competitive market. Traditionally, water utilities have struggled to adapt to a competitive market; missing opportunities to expand their purview, opting instead to preserve the status quo. This article provides a step-by-step methodology for managers to use to develop a more active, entrepreneurial approach to utility management and evolve their planning processes to embrace a more market- and customer-focused approach to service delivery. The authors discuss how strategic planning can be, readily integrated into annual planning processes and how a portfolio management approach provides for evaluation of strategic investment and risk management. They also point out the fact that strategic planning is an evolutionary process.-LH.

J	Sankaran, JK; Luxton, P				Sankaran, JK; Luxton, P			Logistics in relation to strategy in dairying - The case of New Zealand dairy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						logistics; strategy; supply-chain management; dairy industry; agriculture; New Zealand	MODEL	The earliest known instance of scholarly writing on logistics (in 1901) is actually located in agribusiness. While case illustrations of productivity improvements in logistics in agribusiness have routinely featured in the academic literature since then, such efficiency gains are rarely cast in a broader, strategic perspective - a somewhat surprising omission. Consequently, this study seeks to clarify the relationship between logistics and generic business strategy in dairy organisations/industries by using the New Zealand dairy industry as a case in point (The focus is more on operations than on distribution and service). We first clarify that the New Zealand dairy co-operatives and the (export-oriented) New Zealand dairy industry as a whole, have generally followed a strategy of cost leadership. We then review the various ways in which efficiency has been realised in logistics in the industry, and especially dwell on how the structure (e.g co-operative ownership, vertical integration) of the dairy industry has supported and/or hindered the focus on cost leadership. We also examine the extent to which our analysis of supply-chain efficiency extends to other dairy organisations/industries.

J	Shim, SJ; Min, BK				Shim, SJ; Min, BK			Organizational factors associated with expert systems implementation	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							SMALL BUSINESS; SUCCESS; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION; MODEL	This study examines the organizational factors associated with the successful implementation of expert systems (ES), using data from a survey of organizations that have actually implemented ES for their operations. The results show that organizations that practice strategic information systems (IS) planning have management support for IS and have IS diffused across the organization tend to derive more value-added benefits from ES implementation. The results also show that organizations with more decentralized decision-making structure tend to derive more productivity-related benefits from ES implementation. These findings will be useful to managers in assessing the appropriateness of their organizations to ES implementation and further improving the ES implementation practice.

J	McCue, B				McCue, B			Another view of the "small world"	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						small world; acquaintance volume		Coincidental re-introductions to established acquaintances suggest that one draws one's acquaintances from a hypothetical, homogeneous "small world", not to be confused with an acquaintance chain or an acquaintance volume. The world's size can be estimated from the coincidences, given an estimate of the acquaintance volume. A typical Freeman-Thompson phonebook test score and a dozen coincidental introductions give an estimated "small world" of about 1,300,000 persons. Even single cities are much larger, so this result points to the fragmented and insular structure not just of acquaintanceship volumes, but of the milieux from which they are drawn. Conversely, assumptions about the size of the world from which acquaintances are drawn can be combined with information on coincidental introductions to shed light on the size of the acquaintance volume.

It is beholden on us all to try to prevent obesity emerging in countries where its prevalence is starting to increase. There are many countries in Asia where this is so. Obesity prevention necessitates attention to both increasing physical activity and improving nutrition. In this paper we discuss a strategic approach for increasing physical activity. First, we need to better understand physical activity levels and the factors that impact it. Next, we need to design specific and targeted governmentally supported strategies to promote physical activity. Finally we need to critically and objectively evaluate these strategies and then promote those that are successful, and channel limited resources away from those that are not. These goals are achievable through collaborating and sharing technologies. We hope to prevent obesity from engulfing Asia.

The strategy starts with macro choices that drill down to determine micro processes. If a sponsor company can answer the why, how, and what questions for outsourcing and train internal staff accordingly, then a formula is created to optimize CRO relationships. Performance metrics are then closely aligned with corporate goals and driven by a tactical level modeled for the future. With a cohesive plan, the organizational, cultural, and management differences at all levels within a company become secondary to the focus on corporate results.

Many high-technology enterprises lack a comprehensive framework that facilitates an integrated approach. Derived from the diverse, extant literature on leadership, technology management, marketing and new product development, a Generic Value Tree offers a solution. This comprehensive schema highlights the linkage between technology and marketplace. It represents an objectives hierarchy that asserts that maximising enterprise equity demands a strategic focus on four branches: pursuing strategic intent; nurturing an intelligent enterprise; designing innovative goods and se;;ices; and amassing user preference. Its usefulness is tested in two settings: one relies on secondary data; the other relies on primary data collected in a field setting at an actual strategic planning session. The Generic Value Tree is a valuable diagnostic tool in the search for sustainable competitive advantage.

J	Benaroch, M				Benaroch, M			Declarative representation of strategic control knowledge	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article						strategic knowledge; control knowledge; declarative knowledge; knowledge representation; situation-specific models; ontology; knowledge engineering	CONSTRUCTION; SYSTEMS; MODELS	Strategic (control) knowledge typically specifies how a target task is solved. Representing such knowledge declaratively remains a difficult and practical knowledge engineering challenge. The key to addressing this challenge rests on two observations. One, strategic knowledge comprises two finer types of knowledge: subgoaling knowledge used to construct the goal structure for each problem situation pertaining to a target task, and goal-sequencing knowledge used to choose which subgoal in this goal structure is to be pursued at any given moment. Second, when subgoaling knowledge is explicit and expressed in declarative ontological terms, it is possible to fully express goal-sequencing knowledge in the same declarative terms. Building on these observations, we achieve three things. First, we analyse several conventional knowledge-based applications whose subgoaling and goal-sequencing knowledge is implicit, showing that making their subgoaling knowledge explicit permits (re)representing their goal-sequencing knowledge declaratively. Among the applications analysed are MORE and NEOMYCIN. Second, upon studying the roles of goal-sequencing knowledge vis-a-vis subgoaling knowledge, we develop a declarative formalism for representing goal-sequencing knowledge. Finally, we discuss and illustrate key benefits from using our declarative formalism, including an enhanced ability to validate and reuse goal-sequencing knowledge. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

J	De Lopez, TT				De Lopez, TT			Deforestation in Cambodia: a stakeholder management approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY			English	Article						stakeholder management; stakeholder strategy; stakeholder map; stakeholder coalition; conservation; forest; deforestation; Cambodia		Although widely used in the development area, the stakeholder concept has its origins in the field of management. Stakeholder management consists of understanding the actions of stakeholders, and devising strategies to ethically and effectively deal with them. The paper presents a stakeholder management framework for conservation and illustrates it with a study of deforestation in Cambodia. The framework comprises three steps: stakeholder analysis, stakeholder mapping, and development of stakeholder management strategies. The exercise shows the existence of a strong coalition of stakeholders whose main goal is to exploit the forest resources of Cambodia without any regard for sustainability. The efforts of the international community to control deforestation have focused on a reform of forest concessions. Consequently, several primary stakeholders have been ignored. These include local communities, the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, the Ministry of Environment and Cambodia's neighbours. The paper concludes with strategic management guidance for donor intervention. Unless a comprehensive stakeholder management framework is adopted, the forests of Cambodia will rapidly succumb to destruction.

J	Kloot, L				Kloot, L			Using local government corporate plans in Victoria	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION			English	Article								The Victorian state government has required local governments to publish their corporate plans and this paper explores the information provided by their corporate plans. These plans demonstrate diversity in the form and content, but several themes emerge. First, despite the purpose of corporate plans being to demonstrate accountability to the local community, the lack of performance targets reduces the usefulness of these plans for accountability purposes. It also explores objectives which are of major importance to the sector, such as local economic development, which is an issue difficult to control in the local area, being largely determined by federal and state policy. Other important objectives include financial and asset management together with emphases on the local community and accountability, issues which were the drivers of the state government's reform agenda. This article assists those who want to enhance the practice of corporate (strategic) planning in local government.

J	Aron, R; Clemons, EK				Aron, R; Clemons, EK			Achieving the optimal balance between investment in quality and investment in self-promotion for information products	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						information products; internet advertising; product positioning; signaling		When producers of goods (or services) are confronted by a situation in which their offerings no longer perfectly match consumer preferences, they must determine the extent to which the advertised features of the product reflect the product's actual attributes. We find that the two important determinants of sellers' advertising strategy are the Repeg Cost Ratio, and the Repeat Sales Coefficient. The interplay of these two factors gives rise to four possible strategic scenarios. We show that sellers' strategy is clearly explainable in three out of these four scenarios. In the ambiguous fourth scenario, we show that sellers' strategy for information production goods will differ considerably from information consumption goods based on product complexity and cost of product return (borne by the buyer). Finally, we demonstrate that markets are often characterized by self-reinforcing limits on the extent of opportunistic advertising by sellers.

J	Mallick, DN; Mukhopadhyay, SK				Mallick, DN; Mukhopadhyay, SK			Local design vs. global design: A strategic business choice	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						control theory; global strategy; local strategy; product development	PRODUCT	The market for a particular product consists of many customers having different needs and wants. A local design strategy attempts to increase market share and sales revenue by designing many variants of the product to exploit these differences. Such a strategy involves increased requirements for design, manufacturing, and marketing resources. A global design strategy offers a single product concept to all customers. Thus. the choice between a local design strategy and a global design strategy poses a fundamental tradeoff to the managers in many markets. Making such a decision is a complex process as it involves many design, manufacturing and marketing factors. We present a model based on optimal control theory representing major tradeoffs that exist between;een a local design strategy and a global design strategy. We demonstrate. through extensive computational experiments, how the model helps to gain strategic insight into the complex tradeoffs that exist between global design strategy and local design strategy alternatives under various scenarios over the life of a product.

J	Mankins, JC				Mankins, JC			Space solar power: An assessment of challenges and progress	JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING			English	Article								The capability to generate power in space for transmission to terrestrial markets is a long-term visionary goal that embodies a wide range of technical challenges. Space solar-power (SSP) systems will be very large, but they must be affordable if they are to be developed some day. Addressing the technologies required to construct gigawatt-class, commercial "solar-power satellites" in the distant future can open many other applications opportunities in space and on Earth in the near future. Technical hurdles have been explored and characterized by NASA's recent SSP Exploratory Research and Technology Program. The strategic technology areas examined include solar power generation: wireless power transmission; onboard power management and distribution: structural concepts, materials, and controls; and others. Important progress has been achieved since major space power system studies were conducted in the 1970s. However, significant and highly challenging research and technology development must be conducted successfully across a wide range of areas so that affordable and abundant SSP can be realized.

J	Powell, JH				Powell, JH			Generating networks for strategic planning by successive key factor modification	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						strategic planning; networks and graphs; management	FUTURES METHOD	Scenario planning is the most widely used member of a family of strategic planning approaches which use discrete states to explore management issues. Conventional approaches to scenario-based planning emphasise the clarity of using a small number of extrapolations from the present. Recent work has seen the future as a network of states around which movement can take place under the control of various parties. This requires a richer homogeneous set of scenarios and Rhyne's Field Anomaly Relaxation (FAR) technique has served as the basis for that state generation process. FAR has some disadvantages. It can be cumbersome and more importantly, the discriminants of the states are unchanged throughout each cycle of the process. It operates by establishing a large number of possible futures and then clustering these into coherent sets. An alternative approach is presented which grows neighbouring states step by step from existing, plausible self-consistent states. A network of locally related states is thereby established on which basis transition-based planning can be carried out. The relationship of the method to FAR is described, and its use illustrated by an example.

J	Geller, RJ				Geller, RJ			The first year of Health Improvement Programmes; views from Directors of Public Health	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MEDICINE			English	Article						Health Improvement Programme		Background The White Paper The new NHS, modern, dependable gave the strategic lead at the local level in the new National Health Service to Health Authorities (Boards in Scotland and Northern Ireland). They are expected to lead the development of strategies that will identify the health needs of local people and what has to be done to meet them. These Health Improvement Programmes (HlmPs) will be the local strategy for improving health and health care and the means to achieve national targets for each Health Authority or Board area. Method To assess the strengths and weaknesses of HlmP production for 1999, a questionnaire survey was carried out of Health Authorities or Boards throughout the United Kingdom. Participants were all district Directors of Public Health (DsPH) or Chief Administrative Medical Officers (CAMOs). The main outcome measures were the opinions of DsPH or CAMOs on the successes and failures of their local HlmP process. Results Ninety-three (83.8 per cent) DsPH responded. In just over half of all Health Authorities or Boards (56 per cent) the DsPH had taken the lead in producing the HlmP. Many aspects of the HlmP process went well, including multiagency' stakeholder' involvement and partnership working, good project management, and agreeing a limited set of priorities for action. Key problems included: the short timescale and late Departments of Health guidance; difficulty in obtaining commitment from some local 'stakeholders'; linking HlmP aspirations with service and financial planning and securing funding for HlmP priority developments. Action plans to improve health and health care services were well developed in 40.5 per cent of HlmPs. This was less so for social services (8.3 per cent). It was too soon to assess the impact of HlmPs on the public's health. Conclusions DsPH or CAMOs and local 'stakeholders' have been on a learning curve for HlmP production during 1999. Lessons learnt will translate into better HlmPs for next year. DsPH urged the Departments of Health to fully support HlmPs through resources and management processes so that HlmPs can realize their potential benefits for local populations.

J	Chan, SH				Chan, SH			A practical approach for rapid catalyst light-off by means of strategic engine control	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART D-JOURNAL OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING			English	Article						HC; CO and NOx emissions; cold-start emissions control; rapid catalyst light-off; high values of ignition retard		Cold-start emissions pollution from gasoline engines has always been an issue in the urban driving cycle as it contributes a significant share of the overall engine emissions in a typical car journey. Rapid engine warm-up and catalyst light-off are two important factors deciding the overall exhaust emissions in a gasoline-powered electronic fuel injection (EFI) engine. This paper presents a practical approach for rapid catalyst light-off by means of strategic engine control. An existing engine control unit (ECU) was replaced by a programmable engine management system (EMS) so that idling speed, excess-air factor and spark timing can be optimized for improved catalyst light-off at the engine cold-start phase. Results show that with a proper high value of ignition retard (HVIR) control strategy the catalyst light-off time can be shortened to about 40 s with idle speed set at 1750 r/min. Compared with the normal spark timing setting, the cumulative tailpipe emissions during the cold-start phase have been decreased by 90 per cent for CO, 80 per cent for hydrocarbons and 65 per cent for NOx with HVIR implementation. A further increase in the idle speed to 2000 r/min, if allowable, could reduce the catalyst light-off time to less than 30 s from engine cold-start.

J	Couretas, JM; Zeigler, BP; Subramanian, I; Sarjoughian, H				Couretas, JM; Zeigler, BP; Subramanian, I; Sarjoughian, H			Capacity analysis for mixed technology production: evaluating production ramp resource modifications via distributed simulation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article							ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS	This paper describes the design and development of a discrete event simulation based, dynamic, capacity analysis tool. Manufacturing capacity analysis, traditionally approached through the prescribed tools of mathematical programming, is presently devoid of a dynamic simulation framework that delivers multi-period asset evaluations based on a real-time performance estimate. A suggested framework for this class of decisions involves periodic (quarterly), deterministic, constrained evaluation models to specify resource allocation decisions. Capacity evaluation models are inherently non-stationary due to the structural modifications that occur when adding new production resources. Homogeneity is employed here in the uniform description of heterogeneous resources as general mathematical objects, or discrete event models (DEVS). Each object represents both the individual production resource's dynamic state and static parameters. Exercising these objects via simulation optimizes resources through Return on Operating Assets (ROOA), a fixed and variable cost roll-up metric that results in a balance between capital assets (machines) and work-in-process (WIP) allocation for a given demand level. Global optimization is achieved through distributed DEVS/CORBA administrators that monitor and constrain asset investment in the sequential concatenation of time periods. While the production model captures the flow behaviour of manufacturing operations and its performance scale, strategic scope is built into the administrator via alternative rule bases, or specialized management decision sets. Using System Entity Structure Alternative Evaluation (SEAE), these specialized alternatives reconfigure the plant model to produce the non-intuitive results for the different production ramp-up scenarios evaluated.

J	van der Meulen, B; Lohnberg, A				van der Meulen, B; Lohnberg, A			The use of foresight: institutional constraints and conditions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						foresight; innovation policy; systems of innovation; institutional theory; comparative studies	TECHNOLOGY; SCIENCE	The idea of foresight as a new tool for S&T policies rests on the need to face the challenges of high tech developments, to respond to increasing global competition and to develop inter-organizational strategies. However, the impact of technological and global changes varies per country and per innovation sector, as do possibilities to develop inter-organizational strategies. In this article we analyse how the use of foresight studies depends on institutional characteristics of innovation sectors. We distinguish two independent factors to explain why foresight has more impact in certain countries and in certain sectors than in others. The first factor is the dependency between the actors involved in the foresight activity. The second is the strategic uncertainty due to the technological and global developments. The argument is supported by a secondary analysis of national foresight studies and of environmental technology foresight in the Netherlands, and a first analysis of foresight in medical technology.

J	Malvey, D; Hyde, JC; Topping, S; Woodrell, FD				Malvey, D; Hyde, JC; Topping, S; Woodrell, FD			Getting off the bandwagon: An academic health center takes a different strategic path	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article							MEDICAL-CENTERS; MANAGED CARE; SURVIVAL; MERGERS	Focusing on one state university academic health center (AHC) located in a rural setting in the southeastern United States, this case study investigates the strategic response to the increasingly turbulent and competitive environment in the healthcare industry. The qualitative research reported here: involved a review of pertinent documents and archival data and interviews with key informants including AHC executives and staff, community leaders, and others. Additional information was obtained from published sources, including a literature review that covers a five-year period ending in 1997 and searches conducted using the key words "academic medical or health center." The AHC in this case study demonstrates how it is possible to respond proactively to changes in the environment without sacrificing the multiple missions of the institution. This AHC implemented strategies that ensure access for both inner city and rural underserved populations while providing venues for primary care training and educational programs. In addition, the AHC positioned itself to compete more effectively by implementing a continuous quality improvement program that is aimed at maximizing quality while controlling costs. Administrators in not only AHCs but also other healthcare organizations, such as community hospitals and competing systems, should consider the findings from this case study useful in evaluating existing strategies and possible alternatives. In particular, the use of an affiliation strategy for growth in a resource-poor environment may encourage organizations located in rural areas to consider innovative expansion strategies to develop integrated systems of care.

J	Corts, KS				Corts, KS			Focused firms and the incentive to innovate	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article							PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE; PERSISTENCE; COMPETITION; MONOPOLY	This paper explores the possibility that a firm may make a credible strategic commitment to high levels of innovation by limiting its horizontal or vertical scope. Specifically, I develop a model in which a firm decides whether to undertake an innovation that affects a system of products, which can also be interpreted as multiple stages of the production process. The products are technologically related, and innovation in the core product is assumed to impose costs on the producers of ancillary products, due to cannibalization of the old technology and redesign or retooling costs, for example. I demonstrate that a firm may optimally and credibly commit to innovate by choosing to be a focused firm and licensing the production of the ancillary product, even when licensees are inefficient. In stark contrast to the irrelevance results of the strategic delegation literature, this commitment may be credible even when licensing contracts are renegotiable, but only if licensees are sufficiently inefficient.

J	Loosemore, M; Teo, MMM				Loosemore, M; Teo, MMM			Crisis preparedness of construction companies	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								In high-risk industries, companies with well-conceived crisis management plans are at a commercial advantage. While there is some understanding of the risk management practices of construction companies, there is little insight into their crisis preparedness. This paper presents the findings of exploratory research that investigated this issue. Using a diagnostic model of crisis preparedness that has been developed and tested across a broad range of industries, it concludes that if the sample surveyed is typical, then corporate philosophies in construction companies do not support crisis management activities. Furthermore, crisis planning is rudimentary and undertaken in an insular, informal, fragmented fashion, supported by few resources and little strategic guidance. Consequently, many construction companies will have an inadequate understanding of their crisis exposure, of how to cope with crises when they happen, and of how to learn and recover from their aftermath.

J	Dowlatshahi, S				Dowlatshahi, S			Material selection and product safety: theory versus practice	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product design; parts/materials selection; material processing and usage; product safety; product liability; proposition evaluation	DESIGN	The role of material development and selection as well as product safety and liability is explored in this paper. The paper presents a conceptual framework which facilitates an interface between material selection and product safety/liability at the three planning-horizon levels of strategic, intermediate, and tactical. The five specific areas of interface include: (1) strategic material development and usage, (2) product safety, (3) product liability, (4) materials selection and testing and (5) materials usage and processing. Then, five propositions pertaining to each area of interface at each level of planning are proposed and evaluated for a company as an example. The results indicate that the company performed well for two propositions (2) and (3); and performed very poorly for three propositions (1), (4) and (5). The company had to comply with stringent safety and regulatory requirements but was under no internal or external pressure to improve its material development, selection, and processing practices. Finally, the conclusions, assessment, and future research directions are presented. Additional recommendations, prerequisites, or guidelines for effective incorporation of the propositions for the company or other companies that might embark on similar programs are proposed.

It contributes empirically by providing an account of the processes of learning and the emergence of strategies in the post-merger phase; theoretically, by modelling the ways in which communities of practice (founded on collective competence and tacit knowledge) may undergo rapid change; and normatively, by providing a counter-example to the received wisdom of the strategy literature that merging companies should have complementary assets and competencies.

We solve this problem using mixed integer-linear programming, and study the managerial impacts of our models. As a managerial tool, the optimal placement of customer channels to minimize transponder re-balancing was found to have a real and observable profit potential in excess of $54 million for the GE Spacenet series geosynchronous orbit satellites. Further managerial findings and computational results are presented.

J	Traill, WB				Traill, WB			Strategic groups of EU food manufacturers	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS			English	Article							COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION; INDUSTRY; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES; FIRM	Strategic groups of food manufacturers are derived using factor and cluster analysis applied to a survey of European food manufacturers. The aim is to obtain groupings of businesses that are meaningful for industry and policy analysis. Fight strategic groups are derived and profiled. The sources of competitive advantage of the businesses in the eight groups are assessed in relation to expected developments in, the European food industry and the implications for industry and policy analysis are introduced. For example, businesses that have developed competencies in international sales linked either to product or process innovation appear better placed than those relying on local or national brand strategies. Countries with a large share of the former types of firms (e.g., Denmark) are better placed than countries with a large share of the latter types (e.g., Finland).

J	Marsh, I				Marsh, I			Program strategy and coalition building as facets of new public management	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION			English	Article							POLICY	This paper explores two issues:first, the strategic and coalition-building tasks that may be routinely associated with New Public Management (NPM); and second, the implications of acknowledging these tasks for the conception of public management. NPM focuses on performance. it invites managers to accept responsibility for whole programs or systems (Kettle, 1997; Dunleavy 1994; Ridley, 1996; Hood, 1995). This directs attention to basic program frameworks (that is, program strategy), as well as to operations. It involves the purposes of programs. It involves routine attention to such factors as the effectiveness of outcomes, the identification of alternative program configurations, the implications of emerging issues and needs, and the mobilisation of authority for change. In practice, this authority derives both from program stakeholders, as well as from ministers and the broader political system.

J	Powell, JH				Powell, JH			Powergraph - a network-based approach to modelling and managing corporate strategic conflict and co-operation	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						strategy; game theory; networks		Strategic relationships between companies are characterised by a combination of conflict and co-operation. Often the behaviour of partner/rival companies will appear arbitrary, almost irrational because of the necessary limitations on communication between the parties. Understanding, predicting and managing situations such as major project teamings or acquisition struggles is essential for the satisfactory governance of companies but existing conflict modelling has proven less than attractive to practitioners and their advisors. A network-based approach known as Powergraph is described in this study. It represents the corporate situation as a directed graph in which the nodes are the possible states of play. Connections between nodes are represented by logical expressions deriving from the capacities of the players individually or in coalition to bring about the transitions. By consideration of the ordinal preferences of the participants, trajectories of the situation can be described and these trajectories form the basis for management action and intelligence gathering. The method is illustrated by means of a real case study of three defence companies competing for two major contracts.

One methodology was developed by the Foundation for Water Research (FWR), the other is based on a marketing approach translated to the aquatic environment. Results suggest broader consideration of demand and supply-side factors, offered by the marketing-based approach, enables a clearer understanding of anthropogenic use of aquatic resources to be developed. Consequently, estimated environmental benefits are more likely to reflect actual levels of resource use and the nature of a given site, and provide a strategic perspective on investment appraisal. In addition, a rapid assessment technique emerges which facilitates an efficient methodology focusing on essential assessment criteria. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

J	Soh, C; Neo, BS				Soh, C; Neo, BS			IT spending in the midst of the Asian economic downturn: a Singapore perspective	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						IT spending; IT infrastructure; Asian economic crisis		The Asian economic downturn has severely affected the revenue and profitability of companies operating in Asia. This has in turn caused a significant number of companies to reduce their spending on IT, particularly in the countries that have been most affected by the downturn. While IT spending is an immediate and visible effect of the downturn, less visible changes in managerial attitudes towards TT, and approaches to controlling IT spending are likely to have longer term implications to the IT capabilities of companies in the region. In this paper, we examine these issues in the Singapore context, paying particular attention to how companies plan to control and reduce IT infrastructure spending. We found that in the participating firms, managers appear to pay more attention to the Links between business strategy and IT after the downturn. We also found that deferring investments in physical infrastructure and outsourcing were the main approaches to IT cost reduction. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Conclusions: Consistent with national and state priorities, the TCP recommended strategies based on best available evidence in the four action areas: reducing sales of cigarettes to miners, marketing, passive smoking and smoking cessation. Funding of this amount for a single public health issue at a local level represents a unique achievement in the application of an evidence-based approach to population health. Implications: Key elements of our advocacy methods included the involvement of all key primary health care and clinical stakeholders; comprehensive background research to identify evidence-based strategies; careful attention to budget options; strategic lobbying of senior staff and decision makers; the proposal for a multidisciplinary management structure for the TCP and specifications for funding allocation and evaluation. Early achievements and other reflections are discussed.

Our research begins with a study of 32 cases of partnerships between public research laboratories and French firms, large and small. A principal component analysis is used to characterize various strategic contexts of partnerships. We observe in particular that partnerships are successful when dealing with current innovation. Two case studies illustrate these contexts. The first case involves a government research centre laboratory and small and medium firms. The organizational linkages adopted are technical assistance, tests, measures, modelling and designing, and training. The second case is a partnership between academic laboratories and large manufacturers of the automotive industry. It requires fundamental research through a long-term research program. We describe in particular the process through which efficiency conditions can be established. A number of lessons about managing such partnerships can be learned.

Faced with so many new technologies, entrepreneurs of PRC/HK enterprises sometimes feel ill at ease and even bewildered, although the PRC government has been supporting a number of CIM development initiatives since 1986. This paper sketches the development trends of modern manufacturing technologies and their applications in PRC/HK industries. The findings are based on a series of survey visits carried out in PRC/HK. The implementation strategies and methodologies appropriate for manufacturing automation and computerisation are put forward, taking into account the opportunities and challenges faced by these PRC/HK enterprises.

J	Kalu, TCU				Kalu, TCU			Domestic petroleum-related expertise utilization and Nigeria's oil industry survival: A multicriteria decision analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						energy; government; public policy; goal programming; expertise utilization; Nigeria	POLICY; COMPANIES	Despite Nigeria's current economic crisis and the need to remove control structures which were originally designed to protect national interest so as to attract foreign investment in upstream activities of its oil sector, the notion of an indigenously controlled oil sector is still alive in the country. The current paper utilizes a multiperiod goal programming model to examine the effect the enforcement of Nigeria's Petroleum Decree on the utilization of domestic petroleum-related expertise would have on the survival of the multinational oil companies and, therefore, of the oil industry. The results indicate that there are some benefits to the nation in enforcing the Decree, but that to do so now will trigger a chain of events that will culminate in the demise of the oil industry. The results also highlight the danger in using legislation to regulate strategic industries and the role operational researchers can play in public policy design and decisions in the future.

Emphasis is put on the question of how we can build an adaptive organisation that is capable to anticipate changes in its operational environment, and that is capable to adjust its objectives according to the changes. In the strategy literature a lot of attention is put on the strategy formation phase, which has lead us to the situation where strategy is often seen as a pure planning task. The implementation phase and the creation of feedback mechanism for strategic learning are typically overlooked activities. A set of methods and tools are introduced that can be used to improve management of evolution and strategic learning; benchmarking, process assessment, modelling and participative simulation techniques. These methods and tools are developed in the EUREKA TIME project. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lindblom, T; Andersson, B				Lindblom, T; Andersson, B			Strategic moves at the prospect of a deregulated electricity market	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						electricity; deregulation; competition and strategy		The Swedish electricity market has step by step been undergoing a deregulation process during the 1990s, In this respect it is more similar to the deregulation in England and Wales rather than the ones in Norway and Finland. At first the ownership of the national bulb transmission grid was separated from the 12 largest power companies. Thereafter, the grid was opened also to other power companies as well as to electricity distributors. In January 1996 a new Electricity Act advocating third-party access to regional and local distribution grids became operative. It is now possible for every electricity customer to choose supplier. Due to the changed environmental conditions it is of vital importance for electricity distribution companies to reorganise their business and to develop new strategies. According to the Electricity Act the operation of distribution grids must be separated from the electricity selling activities in different companies. This implies additional administration costs. But more important, the third-party access may lead to increased competition within distribution areas. This paper focuses the distributors' strategic moves at the prospect of a deregulated electricity market. It is primarily emphasising their organisational changes, customer information management and product development. What actions and decisions were taken in order to adjust to the changing conditions? How well prepared were the distributors to compete with new actors? What possibilities and threats did they see in connection with the deregulation? The study is based on personal interviews and a questionnaire sent to representatives of Swedish electricity distributors. It shows that the distributors differed regarding their preparation and readiness for the changed market conditions and that an increased market concentration may arise as a consequence of vertically and horizontally integration strategies.

J	Chung, KJ; Tsou, CS				Chung, KJ; Tsou, CS			Analysis and algorithm for the optimal investment times of new manufacturing technologies in a duopoly	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						games of timing; new manufacturing technologies	DIFFUSION; MARKET	On the basis of a dynamic and non-cooperative game-theoretic model, the optimal timings of investments in new manufacturing technologies (NMT) is analysed under duopolistic competition. Non-identical incumbents with time-proportional demand always wait for some delay to invest in NMT. The existence of silent timing equilibrium is addressed subsequently. We show that cost-reducing NMT diffuse over time within a duopoly. The investments in strategic NMT, however, may be distributed through time or in a "swarm". Economic interpretations of initial options and the comparative statics presented in this paper help decision makers develop strategies and make decisions under the situation they face. Finally, a computational algorithm of optimal timings could verify this analysis and facilitate the real applications of game-theoretic models. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Toppen, R; Smits, M; Ribbers, P				Toppen, R; Smits, M; Ribbers, P			Financial securities transactions: a study of logistic process performance improvements	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						securities transactions; logistics; performance		The goal of this paper is to develop a better understanding of the intra- and inter-organisational processes related to financial securities transactions, and, ultimately, to provide guidelines for the design of inter-organisational systems in information-intensive markets and networks. A framework is presented to evaluate the influence of eight factors on the performance of the securities transaction process. These factors are stakeholders, competition, information technology, market network design, perceived risk, process design, information, and trust. The framework is used in a case study of one of Europe's largest asset management organisations (the Robeco Group). It is concluded that improvement of the logistic process for securities transactions implies a balancing act between process design, risk perception of the stakeholders and trust.

J	Baltas, G; Doyle, P				Baltas, G; Doyle, P			A flexible model for consumer choice in packaged goods markets	JOURNAL OF THE MARKET RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article							BRAND CHOICE; HETEROGENEITY; PURCHASE; PREFERENCES; DEPENDENCE; ELASTICITY; BEHAVIOR; LOYALTY	Modelling brand demand at the level of individual choice decisions is a central issue in market research and the multinomial legit has become a predominant framework. But the uniform patterns of brand substitution that flow from the legit model limit its ability to reflect the structure of consumer preferences in today's markets characterised by high levels of market segmentation and product differentiation. In this paper, the heteroscedastic extreme value model is described and applied to a panel dataset. Its flexibility is shown better to approximate the structure of demand in markets with a variety of brands with different characteristics and appealing to different consumer segments. The model permits differential substitutability among competing brands and yields useful diagnostics for strategic brand management.

As public health re-evaluates its key strategies, it call take advantage of its strategic role in purchasing medical care to forge new partnerships that benefit its constituents. Methods: Specific roles for public health in medical care purchasing are discussed. The state of Missouri is used as an example of successful strategies for positioning public health as a leader in the managed care environment. Key strategies include increasing influence in contracting; selecting and. reporting of key health status indicators; promoting use of population-based data files taking leadership roles in government-sponsored insurance programs; and assuring stability of critical health conditions during managed care transitions. Conclusion: Public health has unprecedented opportunities to develop new methods for improving health status. Public health's well-developed scientific principles and methods, combined with strategic leadership, will position the discipline in the forefront of the dialogue about our nation's health system into the next century.

J	Cavaye, ALM				Cavaye, ALM			An exploratory study investigating transnational information systems	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						transnational information systems; IS development; IS management	INTERORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS; COLLABORATION; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; CONFLICT	Transnational information systems (TIS) are information systems that cross organisational as well as national boundaries. This paper describes an exploratory study which gathered case study data from four TIS projects. The data was used to describe problems encountered during TIS development and management and to discuss solutions found for those problems. Problems and solutions were categorised according to domain (technical, organisational, and institutional issues) and according to development phase (identification, building, implementation, and maintenance). It was found that organisations tend to address difficulties by lowering the level of aspiration of the TIS rather than addressing problems head-on. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	den Hond, F				den Hond, F			Inertia and the strategic use of politics and power: a case study in the automotive industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						inertia; automotive industry; end-of-life vehicles; industry lobby; Germany; France		'Inertia' refers to the inability or unwillingness of companies to adapt to a changing external environment. The paper explores how the automotive industry collectively responded in the German and French policy arenas to regulatory pressure concerning a reduction in the amounts of waste remaining from the processing of end-of-life vehicles. It is argued that lack of change (inertia) may be the preferred business opportunity to industry, which is achieved by its strategic use of politics and power during the regulatory process.

It combines a resource-based approach with recent insights from the literature on small and medium-sized firms, professional service, and computer-service firms. Top managerial capital (in terms of inspiration, competence, and communication) and organizational capital (in terms of external, professional, and employee orientation as well as networking, financial management, and market focus) are assumed to be major predictors of organizational performance.

J	Zairi, M; Youssef, MA				Zairi, M; Youssef, MA			Competing through modern quality principles: a forward management approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						quality programs; forward management; competitiveness; TQM		Cost efficiency is no longer the sole principle for competing in global markets. The authors of this paper have shown in many of their individual as well as joint publications that quality plays an important role in the competitiveness equation. However, quality in and by itself cannot achieve the synergistic results that many organizations hope to achieve when they embrace and implement quality programs. Timeliness and responsiveness to customer needs as well as the agility of the manufacturing processes have become the main ingredients of the competitiveness equation. It is necessary, therefore, that management should abandon many of their traditional approaches to managing quality and unlearn many of the old practices. The next generation manufacturing companies who want to survive, advance, and thrive in the next century will have to think proactively and embrace what we define here as 'forward management'. In this paper, the authors offer a simple model of forward management. The model, as Figure 1 shows, examines the performance at the strategic and operational levels. The former is labelled 'forward management', while the tatter is labelled 'forward engineering'. The components of the two dimensions of our model are also depicted in Figure 1. Finally, the model shows the impact of better performance on satisfying the needs of three important constituencies: customers, shareholders and employees.

Survey respondents' lack of familiarity with a new technology and strategic behavior lead to underestimates of actual willingness to pay. Moreover, weather information has numerous agricultural and nonagricultural uses, and only sampling growers overlooks gains to other potential users. Low hypothetical willingness-to-pay responses of a subsection of the potential adopters should not necessarily discourage investment. Rather, a substantial willingness to pay may signal a need for further market research.			Cohen, DR (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT AGR & RESOURCE ECON,BERKELEY,CA 94720, USA.

Four dimensions of organizational performance were identified: operational performance, labor management effectiveness, workers' well-being and remuneration. On the whole, automation was perceived to have resulted in greater improvements in operational performance and worker's well-being than in labor management effectiveness and workers' remuneration. However, there was significant positive correlations among all four dimensions of organizational performance. Moreover, the key determinants that affected the extent of improvement achieved by automation varied among the four dimensions. Implications of the findings for automation management are discussed.

They involve all departments of a company along the line of the added value chain. Especially decentralised and independently responsible segments form the basis of the new kind of successful companies. An example of a decentralised company structure is given, where the decentralised group work has great advantages because of the positive strategic effects on customer orientation, on employee and group motivation as well as on manageability.

J	Nilsson, CH				Nilsson, CH			Strategic alliances, trick or treat? The case of Scania	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						strategic alliance; competitive advantage; flexibility; economies of scale; time based competition	INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES; ORGANIZATION; AGREEMENTS	The literature on strategic alliances is vast. Most authors are pro-alliances and the casual reader may thereby be lulled into a false sense of security concerning the advantages of strategic alliances. There are several possible advantages of strategic alliances however by joining an alliance several opportunities are also forsaken. The opposite strategic option, a ''go it alone strategy'' generates several strategic advantages which would be difficult to gain in a strategic alliance. The literature on strategic alliances is reviewed concerning the motives for forming alliances and the way in which examples of alliances are used, and misused, in the literature by scholars. The case of Scania, the Swedish heavy truck producer, is then presented as an example of the strategic advantages that call be achieved by not entering into horizontal strategic alliances.

J	Kumar, A; Mohamed, Z; Motwani, J; Youssef, M				Kumar, A; Mohamed, Z; Motwani, J; Youssef, M			A dynamic tool requirement planning model for flexible manufacturing systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS			English	Article						FMS; MRP; MPS; service level; tool planning; tool replenishment	ALLOCATION PROBLEM; FMS; POLICIES	Despite their strategic potential, tool management issues in flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) have received little attention in the literature. Nonavailability of tools in FMSs cuts at the very root of the strategic goals for which such systems are designed. Specifically, the capability of FMSs to economically produce customized products (flexibility of scope) in varying batch sizes (flexibility of volume) and delivering them on an accelerated schedule (market response time) is seriously hampered when required tools are not available at the time needed, On the other hand, excess inventory of tools in such systems represents a significant cost due to the expensive nature of FMS tool inventory. This article constructs a dynamic tool requirement planning (DTRP) model for an FMS tool planning operation that allows dynamic determination of the optimal tool replenishments at the beginning of each arbitrary, managerially convenient, discrete time period. The analysis presented in the article consists of two distinct phases: In the first phase, tool demand distributions are obtained using information from manufacturing production plans (such as master production schedule (MPS) and material requirement plans (MRP)) and general tool life distributions fitted on actual rime-to-failure data. Significant computational reductions are obtained if the tool failure data follow a Weibull or Gamma distribution. Tn the second phase, results from classical dynamic inventory models are modified to obtain optimal tool replenishment policies that permit compliance with such FMS-specific constraints as limited tool storage capacity and part/tool service levels. An implementation plan is included.

J	Rosenfeld, RA; Cunningham, D; Schmidt, K				Rosenfeld, RA; Cunningham, D; Schmidt, K			American Sociological Association elections, 1975 to 1996: Exploring explanations for ''feminization''	AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Since 1972, the proportion of women in American Sociological Association governance positions has increased. Woman candidates for ASA offices and the ASA Council have been overrepresented and generally have had higher odds of winning than male candidates. We examine three possible factors behind these trends: the general impact of the women's movement, the influence of Sociologists for Women in Society (SWS), and elite dilution. Liberal attitudes fostered by the women's movement appear to have raised voter willingness to select woman candidates. SWS members were overrepresented among candidates, and SWS membership (for women) and support for its goals increased chances of being elected. High voting rates of SWS members could have swayed elections, as well. Contrary to elite dilution arguments, woman and man candidates differed little from each other or over time in productivity, honors, or experience, although women were elected earlier in their careers than were men and were less often employed in the most prestigious graduate departments. In analysis using measures of all three factors together, gender affected election success, with marginal effects for productivity; effects of SWS membership and professional location were not statistically significant.

J	Jennings, D				Jennings, D			Building societies and strategic sourcing: Criteria and dynamics	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article								In the literature of strategic management outsourcing has become recognised as a means to achieve a range of strategic benefits. This article examines the criteria employed by building societies to select and evaluate opportunities for outsourcing. The societies' sourcing decisions are subject to multiple criteria that, together with a conservative culture, act to limit the use of outsourcing. Case material is used to develop a model of sourcing that relates the processes of evaluation, review and learning to changes in the technological, legal and market environment. Changes in the environment require the societies to retain the ability to monitor review and possibly reverse sourcing decisions.

J	Draugalis, JR; Harrison, DL				Draugalis, JR; Harrison, DL			Administrative career planning: A five-year update of the pharmacy deanship	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	97th Annual Meeting of the American-Association-of-Colleges-of-Pharmacy	JUL 14-18, 1996	RENO, NV	Amer Assoc Coll Pharm				The educational, personal, and professional backgrounds of today's pharmacy deans, as well as career and academic issues were assessed. Using a self-administered mail questionnaire and after two follow-up mailings, 64 of the 71 current deans (eight institutions with interim or acting deans were excluded) responded, yielding a 90.1 percent response rate. Forty-three deans had five years or more experience whereas the remaining 21 respondents were designated newly named deans. A strictly hierarchical model (faculty to department chair/head to assistant/associate dean to dean) described the career ladder of less than 15 percent of newly named deans. If missing one level of the career ladder, newly named deans were more likely to have skipped assistant/associate deanship appointments rather than to have skipped department chair/head positions in ascending the career ladder. Newly named deans recommended AACP programming, administrative fellowships, higher education management institutes, and national professional organization involvement as most beneficial to professional development. The higher education administration mentoring activities of deans were assessed with a series of items. All respondents were asked to rate nine administrative skills on a five-point importance scale. The deans identified fiscal management/resource allocation, governance and decision-making, strategic planning, and fund-raising as the most important managerial capabilities. Where appropriate, comparisons were made between newly named deans and deans with at least five years of experience to identify trends and changes. The results of this study provide insights into administrative career paths and may be useful in career planning.

J	Howells, J				Howells, J			Management and the hybridization of expertise: EFTPOS in retrospect	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								This paper will show how the UK banks learnt the strategic value of retaining IT expertise in-house through their experience of the design of EFTPOS networks. The banks began by attempting to 'buy-in' IT expertise from other organizations, but they were first compelled to locate expertise in a jointly-controlled organization called EFTPOS UK, then forced to develop the new IT expertise within their existing IT departments. These manipulations of the 'organizational location' of expertise gave individual banks the ability to create their own technology strategies, which they promptly exploited in an attempt to gain competitive advantage. It will be argued that a greater capacity to form individual technology strategies and exploit competitive advantage will result from the active management of two other dimensions of expertise: these are termed the internal location and the individual partition of expertise. The first term refers to where in the organization technical expertise is located and the second to how technical expertise is divided between individuals. The process by which the individual partition of expertise changes is called the hybridization of expertise and it is argued that although this is to an extent 'natural' it may certainly be managed. The case for a more aggressive and explicit expertise strategy, including the active management of the process of hybridization, is made by reference to the nature of the network design and practices in the management of technical expertise in other industries.

J	AlMazidi, S; Ghosn, AA				AlMazidi, S; Ghosn, AA			A management model for technology and R&D selection	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						evaluation process; management; management review; evaluation		Research proposals at the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR) undergo a two-stage review process which includes technical and management reviews. These reviews scrutinize the proposed R&D projects and associated technologies to ensure compliance with the institute's strategic plans and goals. The evaluation process is judgmental in nature, which makes the decisionmaking process very complex. To soften the evaluation complexity, a model was developed to assist top and middle management in their decision making when selecting among the various proposed technologies and R&D projects The model is based on Multi-perspective Decision Support Analysis. The perspectives considered include: Scientific/Technical, Management, National/ Socio-economic and Document preparation/presentation perspectives. Each perspective consists of a set of statements to be answered using multiple-choice answers which indicate the extent of agreement with a given statement. The model can be implemented for PC users. It is quantifiable, comprehensive, objective, flexible for further development and its output can be utilized in future analysis. A case study at KISR using the model is presented herein including analysis of available data and related discussions and remarks.

J	Diener, BJ; Saklad, H				Diener, BJ; Saklad, H			Portico, SA	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article								As it moves to expand its product line to include oak doors, Portico, S.A., is weighing whether to continue using environmental certification of its forestry operations as an integral part of its corporate strategy. When its high-end, residential exterior-we doors were made from tropical mahogany, it was important to have environmental certification in order to avoid controversies about deforestation and to gain entry into important U.S. distribution channels. Now, however, Portico is questioning whether that strategy proved sufficiently beneficial to them to warrant pursuing the same certification for their new line of oak doors. Oak, after all, is not as controversial as tropical mahogany. Portico, S.A., located in Heredia, Costa Rica, manufactures high-end, residential exterior-use mahogany doors for export to the United States. Some of its mahogany is supplied by its subsidiary, Tecnoforest del Norte, established to oversee its natural mahogany forest acquired through a ''debt-for-nature'' swap in 1987. This operation had earned environmental certification from Scientific Certification Systems. By 1994, Portico's sales had grown to 60,000 units per year. The mahogany needed to satisfy the demand had been obtained by increasing the frequency of cutting in the managed forest and by introducing engineered wood technology (i.e., veneers and butcher-bloch interior pieces), which enabled Portico to continue making solid mahogany doors while wing the raw material in the most efficient manner. In 1994, Portico's management believed that there were significant business risks associated with increasing the company's investment in mahogany forests. Concurrently, the market for high-end exterior doors, both within and outside the United Stales, was growing. In order to expand its sales, the company would need to we an additional premium wood material, American Red Oak. This world also enable Portico to offer its customers doors made of both mahogany and oak, considered to be the best materials for premium exterior-use doors. Because Portico did not own forests of American Red Oak, it planned La purchase the oak in the United States, ship it to Costa Rica where the doors would be produced, and then reexport the finished doors to the United States and other markets. However, this oak did not carry an environmental certification. Portico's management felt that the environmental certification had been essential in helping them avoid controversies about tropical deforestation and gaining distribution through U.S. retail chains such as The Home Depot, but they wandered whether the same certification would be as important in the case of American Red Oak, an abundant species over which there had been little or no environmental controversy. This case includes strategic management issues about growth strategies and the inclusion of proactive environmental policies in corporate strategies and information on environmental issues and on the high-end residential exterior-use door market in the United States. Environmental information in the case includes descriptions of debt-for-nature swaps, tropical hardwood deforestation, sustainable logging, the history and status of logging in Costa Rica, natural forest management, and environmental certification under Scientific Certification Systems.

J	Dominguez, LV; Cirigliano, M				Dominguez, LV; Cirigliano, M			Chocolates El Rey: Industrial modernization and export strategy	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article								The introductory article to this special issue points out that export-oriented policies have proven superior to inward-oriented policies in delivering both long-term economic growth and quality of life indicators. One reason is that export-oriented policies demand economic liberalization as well as reductions in market distortions from import barriers, subsidies, and internal market inefficiencies. However, a number of management writers, including Porter, Michael E., The Competitive Advantage of Nations, Free Press, New York, (1990), have suggested thai factor costs and availability are not a sufficient basis for sustainable competitiveness in world markets. Nations will attain global competitive advantages to the extent that they are able to foster a spectrum of related industries led by companies possessing a broad set of managerial competencies. Understanding how world-class industries and companies develop remains one of the major research issues in public and corporate policy. This is even less well understood in the case of developing nations, because they have been less well researched and because most studies have focused on industry policy for newly industrializing countries (NICs) and highly industrialized nations. The dilemmas and decisions of Chocolates EI Rey and the Venezuelan cocoa industry richly illustrate the commitment required to achieve world-class competitiveness at company and industry levels. In the early 1990s, Venezuela began to open its economy and to encourage nontraditional exports. This transition came to an early halt as a result of a number of political scandals and public opinion backlash in a country accustomed to big government and managed markets. The policy reversals that followed have had a dismal effect on the Venezuelan economy, which has plunged from one crisis to another Nonetheless, there have been an increase in internal competition and a drive to increase nontraditional exports. Heightened competition has challenged Venezuelan companies to increase their capabilities, even if they do not enter international markets. Some companies simply have sold out to multinational firms. Others have attempted to develop into world-class competitors. For example, some have forged strategic alliances with multinational companies (see Ickis article in this issue). Some, as Chocolates El Rey, have attempted to go it alone. The Chocolates EI Rey case traces the efforts made by that company both to raise standards in the Venezuelan cocoa industry and to forge a niche for high-quality products in industrial markets. In those markets, there is a wide supply of high-quality goods, intense competition, and well-defined user preferences. Two of the major challenges set forth in the case are: Export Strategy: Which market segments to target, how to advantageously differentiate the company from entrenched competitors, how to distribute its products to the appropriate segments, what sort of presence to have in export markets, and what price to charge different channel members. Developing Brand Equity: How to overcome the negative image associated with goods from underdeveloped countries in such a way that an adequate market share may be achieved al profitable prices. The case lends itself to other teaching purposes as well. It illustrates the scape, uses, and limitations of market research; it also is good for a discussion of the company-level process of industrial reconversion in countries that are liberalizing their economies. The case also would be suited to a discussion of the effects of development policies on company and industry performance. The clouds that were gathering over the Venezuelan economy in 1994 raised once again the specter of renewed exchange control regimes and overvalued currencies that have plagued Venezuela's economy. An overvalued currency could greatly complicate El Rey's pricing in export markets. We hope that the case will encourage research on the development of brand equity (Aaker, D. G., Managing Brand Equity, Free Press, New York, 1991; Keller; K. L., Conceptualizing, Measuring and Managing Customer-based Brand Equity, Journal of Marketing 57 (January 1993): 1-22) by firms from less developed countries (LDCs). Venezuela's cocoa industry laced many of the same problems as other emerging industries; for example, the marketability of whose products is hampered by adverse consumer perceptions (Heslop, Louise A., and Papadopoulos, Nicholas, But who knows where and when: Reflections on the images of countries and their products, in Product-Country Images, International Business Press, New York, 1993; Samiee, Saeed, Customer evaluations of products in a global market J. Int. Bus. Stud. 25, mo. (1994):579-604). Venezuela as a tropical country is ideally suited to cocoa production. However, El Rey faced resistance from industrial customers and household consumers who did not associate Venezuela with the production of high-quality chocolate; in fact, there were negative perceptions that derived from Venezuela's industrial policy mistakes. The clue raises interesting issues about overcoming negative associations and determining which hinds of associations should be favored (e.g., whether functional or hedonic) in building brand equity with the trade. EI Rey's internationalization diverged from the notion of a process of incrementally deeper commitments to export markets in response to unsolicited initial orders and gradual learning. El Rey started out with a major investment in plant design, process improvements, and human resources, all in response to a vision and a strategic imperative identified by top management. Whereas early stages of internationalization are supposed to respond to importer pull, that is, to the needs and designs of developed-country exporters (Wortzel, L. H., and Vernon-Wortzel, H., Globalizing strategies for multinationals from developing countries. Columbia Journal of World Business (Spring 1988):27-35), El Ray contemplated immediately participating in the domestic channel in the United States with its own company and brand name identity.

J	Sheu, C; Krajewski, LJ				Sheu, C; Krajewski, LJ			A heuristic for formulating within-plant manufacturing focus	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article							HIERARCHICAL GROUPING TECHNIQUES	The concept of manufacturing focus suggests that each plant is assigned a unique set of manufacturing tasks derived from the firm's competitive strategy. Many empirical studies have verified the importance and benefits of manufacturing focus in enhancing a firm's competence in the market. Nonetheless there is no methodology offered for designing such a manufacturing system with considerations of resource requirements although the need has been recognized. In this study, we propose a methodology that can help managers arrive at a manufacturing focus design within a plant. Because of the large size and nonlinear nature of the problem, a heuristic solution is proposed. The heuristic translates the strategic concept of competitive priorities into management parameters, thereby allowing incorporation of market factors into manufacturing process design. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology offers managers the opportunity to generate and assess alternative focus designs which are otherwise unavailable. The use of the heuristic is straightforward in practical situations and should greatly facilitate the achievement of manufacturing focus with minimal resource requirements. Overall, this research provides an analytical framework for further research in focused manufacturing.

J	Segelod, E				Segelod, E			Corporate control of investments and management styles	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						resource allocation; capital budgeting; investment; corporate control; management styles; contingency model	CAPITAL-BUDGETING TECHNIQUES; STRATEGIC CONTROL; FIRM	This article describes how corporate managers of major Swedish groups in different industries exert control over investment requests and the direction of the investments of their groups, The study is based on interviews with the corporate managers, who are responsible for the capital budgeting procedures of their groups, and analyses of their investment manuals. The article describes what they perceive as their most important means of control, and differences between firms in different lines of industry. These differences can partly be explained by the need to coordinate investments of different kinds and in different parts of the group. The article shows how the design of the resource allocation system depends on the character of the investments and requires a certain management style. This connection between investments, management styles and resource allocation systems shows that there is no ideal resource allocation system optimal for all groups.

Following changes in retailing and especially in the fashion industry, this chain has developed a strategic information system intended to improve its purchasing and distribution processes. The system, called FIPS (for 'Fashion Information and Planning System'), is integrated with the company's warehouse management and financial planning functions. It consists of two main modules: the 'Fashion Information System' and the 'Purchase Planning and Control'. The case study first reports on the business factors that led to the development of FIPS, the design features of the system, as well as its cost and benefits. It then discusses the organizational impact of the system, mainly in terms of IT-enabled innovative business procedures, changing functions and competencies within the company, and redefining the role of IT in the corporation. Finally, possible future extensions of the system are presented.

The scheme was constructed during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1985, to meet increasing water demand, a gravity-fed system of deep tunnels was devised by Thames Water Utilities Ltd; this involved a full ground investigation and underground obstruction survey to establish the optimum tunnel route, bearing in mind the many and various constraints. A series of shafts was sunk to connect directly into the ring main with the purpose of either introducing water at major water-treatment works or acting as pump-out shafts at strategic locations around the capital. The tunnels and shafts were designed to be built in two phases. Phase 1 was constructed using conventional wedgeblock techniques, but problems were encountered which resulted in increased costs and delay. Phase 2 therefore necessitated a different approach. The company adopted a completely new strategy by changing the form of contract, purchasing its own tunnel boring machines, and redesigning the tunnel linings. One of the keys to the success of the ring main was the new expanded wedgeblock concrete lining. Design calculations were prepared and finite element analysis work was carried out. The new rings were subjected to build and load tests, both on individual segments and complete rings, using specially designed test rigs.

We propose that this preference strengthens an essential sociocognitive factor in the leadership mix of the top management team, thereby enriching its value as a strategic resource. The Jungian framework offers the means for testing this intuitively appealing proposition. If supported, this relationship establishes the practical value of a gender diverse executive team.

J	Johannsen, CG				Johannsen, CG			Strategic issues in quality management .2. Survey analysis	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article								Based on theoretical considerations of an earlier article in the Journal of Information Science [4], this paper focuses on to what extent and how business-oriented libraries and information centres in the Nordic countries have implemented strategic quality management (SQM). For this purpose, an operational assessment model encompassing the relevant criteria for measuring SQM in library and information services (LIS) sector environments is proposed. Then, empirical findings from the 1995 Nordic SQM survey of business information services (corporate information centres, special libraries and academic libraries) are presented to highlight managerial problems and inconsistencies and to identify target areas for management improvement efforts. The includes the application of advanced statistical techniques, such as factor and cluster analysis.

J	Lang, JW				Lang, JW			Strategic alliances between large and small high-tech firms (the small firm licensing option)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategic alliances; licensing technologies; SMEs and technology transfer		In this paper, I have used the material gathered from the interviews with directors of the three companies studied, to attempt to understand why they have been successful in their respective licensing agreements. Specifically, I examine three related questions: why licensing may be a beneficial form of partnering for the small firm to take?; how the small firm may protect itself in the agreements?; and the importance of the boundary spanning role and micro-bargaining situations struck at the firm boundaries. Clearly, any 'results' and/or conclusions are tentative and point to the need for further work in this area. This paper does attempt to address a relatively overlooked area of research and study, that of small/large firm alliances using licensing as thr preferred mode of partnering. The majority of the literature published to date in this area subsume licensing as a governance structure under the wider umbrella of strategic alliances. In addition, research in these topics tends to lean towards the large firm as licensor. In this paper, the reader will see this reversed, ie, small firm as licensor. The research was conducted via in-depth interviews with various personnel of the companies involved and took a grounded theory approach in exploring and gathering the data.

J	Muffatto, M				Muffatto, M			Evolution of product development in Japanese automobile firms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VEHICLE DESIGN			English	Article						automobile industry; Japan; lean design; new product development; product variety	PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY	In Japanese firms, new product development is currently undergoing a period of transition. Firms are seeking new elements of competitivity after the recovery of the performance of product development in American and European firms. In particular, the product development model, based upon a product variety strategy, which was adopted by Japanese firms during the pre-1990 period of continuous growth, is changing. The crisis of the model highlights some negative aspects of both the strategy and organization of product development and, simultaneously, underlines the need for a shift towards a lean design perspective. In order to develop the lean design perspective, the origins and the performance of a strategy based on product variety need is analysed. Product variety is also studied in relation to the dimensions of market, production and product planning and the evolution of the product variety strategy is analysed. Particular attention is paid to the evolution of the automobile product structure in relation to product planning activities. So the platform concept is taken into account both from a technical and an organizational point of view. The strategic and organizational implications from a multiproject management perspective are also analysed.

J	Sluyter, GV				Sluyter, GV			Application of TQM to mental health: Lessons from ten mental health centers	JOINT COMMISSION JOURNAL ON QUALITY IMPROVEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st National Conference on Total Quality Management in Mental Health	MAY 04-05, 1995	ST LOUIS, MO	Univ Missouri, Inst Mental Hlth, Excellence Missouri Fdn, Amer Network Community Opt & Resources, Fulton State Hosp, St Louis Mental Hlth Ctr, St Louis Dev Disabil Treatment Ctr			QUALITY; CARE	Background: The principles and techniques of total quality management (TQM) have only recently been applied to the field of mental health. This article reviews issues and offers some preliminary observations, based on the author's consultation and training work with ten state-operated mental health organizations in Missouri (Jul 1, 1994-Jun 30, 1995). Cultural dimension: Since many mental health organizations have operated in the public sector as part of large, hierarchical state agencies, the legacy of bureaucratic structures and a command and control leadership style may pose additional challenges. Technical dimension: Two types of training have proven helpful in the Missouri project: general overview or awareness training for all staff and specialized training for team leaders and facilitators. Strategic dimension: To be successful with TQM, mental health organizations should clearly delineate their governing ideas, continuously reinforce them with all staff, and use the ideas as a measuring stick for progress. Some of the organizations in the Missouri project link their governing ideas and strategic planning efforts with critical success factors and the measurement methodology to track them. Structural dimension: This dimension, which may include a quality council, a quality department, and quality improvement (QI) teams, also extends to the way in which facilities are organized and function. The structure evolving from a team-oriented, time-limited, data-based, and problem-solving approach can facilitate the functioning of the entire organization. Conclusions: The philosophy and techniques of TQM are as applicable to mental health as to health care in general-the question is one more of motivation than of fit.

J	Stanwick, PA				Stanwick, PA			Mental imagery: An alternative to top management team replacement for declining organizations	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cognition; company performance; heuristics; management; organizational change; performance management	STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING; DIALECTICAL INQUIRY; DEVILS ADVOCACY; BIASES; PERFORMANCE; ATTITUDES; IMPACT	The role of managerial cognitive processes has so far been largely neglected within strategy research which examines organizational decline and recovery. Proposes that heuristics used by managers such as: availability, representativeness, adjustment and anchoring may contribute to the declining performance of the organization. Suggests that mental imagery could be used to adjust these heuristics and change the cognitive processes of the existing managers instead of replacing the top management team in declining organizations. This change in cognitive processes could help increase the ability of a declining firm to improve its performance.			Stanwick, PA (corresponding author), AUBURN UNIV,AUBURN,AL 36849, USA.

J	Labroukos, NS; Lioukas, S; Chambers, D				Labroukos, NS; Lioukas, S; Chambers, D			Planning and performance in state-owned enterprises: A multidimensional assessment	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article							STRATEGIC DECISION-PROCESSES; ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; INDUSTRY; COMPREHENSIVENESS; CONSENSUS; CONTEXT; MODEL	The present paper investigates the relationship between planning and performance in the context of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). It considers dimensions of planning relating to: decentralisation, formalisation, depth of analysis, monitoring/reviewing, and coverage of plan content. Each dimension is operationalised through multiple measures and composite variables, as derived from statistical analysis. Planning variables are then related to performance, which is approached by 'output' and 'process' effectiveness. Output effectiveness is measured through profitability, growth and innovativeness indicators. Process effectiveness refers to the role of planning in organising and focusing management effort; measures are constructed which refer to planning's contribution to awareness of factors external to the enterprise, cross-functional integration, mobilisation of human potential and exercise of management control. The analysis controls for tightness of the regulatory framework, market competition, and enterprise size. Empirical testing is based on data from the operational planning processes of 55 Greek SOEs. Statistical analysis reveals various significant associations between specific aspects of planning and measures of output and process effectiveness. More significant appears to be the impact of planning on innovative aspects of performance, as well as on the internal management process. The results offer new insights into the impact of planning, and justify the multidimensional treatment of both planning and performance. Directions for future research are pointed out, and conjectures for practitioners are derived.

J	Nilsson, CH; Dernroth, J				Nilsson, CH; Dernroth, J			The strategic grounding of competitive advantage - The case of Scania	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Production Research	AUG 16-20, 1993	LAPPEENRANTA, FINLAND			strategy; grounded strategy; top-down; bottom-up; sources of competitive advantage; item standardisation; modular production; Scania; heavy trucks	GENERIC STRATEGIES; PERFORMANCE; COST	Scania has performed well above average in the heavy truck industry during a considerable time span. Scania's sources of competitive advantage are presented and their interrelations and significance for the business strategy analysed in order to explain the success of Scania. Strategic issues are traditionally analysed in a top-down procedure starting with the corporate strategy and proceeding by disaggregation of the strategy down in the organisation. This is known as the grand strategy perspective and views strategy as a ''chain of causality''. We introduce the grounded strategy perspective which views strategy as a ''pattern in a stream of decisions and actions'', and takes its starting point in the stream of activities within the company. Grounded strategy synthesises the strategy according to a bottom-up procedure. The case of Scania and the heavy truck industry is analysed according to these two different perspectives on strategy. The methodological approach may be different depending on the perspective. The results of the case study from each perspective reveal interesting implications to strategists: scholars as well as practitioners. The grand strategy approach appears to be advantageous for analysis at the higher levels of strategy, while the grounded approach appear to be advantageous at the lower levels of strategy.

This paper proposes an approach to fostering greater interaction at departmental level through a network of former graduates in geography and their employers. It describes the concept of a graduates and employers database system (GEDS) and outlines how such a system should become a key resource for strategic management and planning in geography departments.

With the rapid changes in technology and today's competitive marketplace, firms need continuing education to stay competitive. Yet, with an ever increasing array of choices, how does a firm decide what continuing education to invest in? This article describes a framework for improving decision making on continuing education. The benefits of this process include (1) improving the linkage of educational opportunities to business performance; (2) defining the decision process behind budgeting for continuing education; and (3) strengthening the information on which these decisions are based. This process unifies continuing education into a coordinated effort and integrates it with the other strategic initiatives of the firm.

Although particular political, cultural and economic factors lead to different strategic approaches in different countries, all are faced with balancing resource allocation against the perceived desirability of the results. In many countries the social urgency to address this issue has' reached a critical status. All of the current changes and challenges in health care delivery are to a large extent being driven by these considerations. Information systems consisting of telecommunication and computing technologies will play a key role in supporting emerging delivery systems. The purpose of this brief paper is to identify the major themes within this complex network of considerations and to serve perhaps as a road map in on-going system design and evaluation efforts.

In the management literature one area of controversy is the appropriate approach to strategic decision-making for organizations operating in this type of environment. This paper reports the results of a study examining the relative effectiveness of the rational-analytic and incremental approaches to strategic decision-making. Analyses of data from a sample of 27 matrix organizations indicate that strategic decision processes which are high in comprehensiveness (rational-analytic) produce more favorable strategic results than processes which are more incremental in nature. Implication of these findings to theory development and management are discussed.

Since the late 1970s, numerous efforts have been launched world-wide to develop, employ, and deploy integration technology as a strategic weapon to compete in the global market-place. Important results have been obtained, including computer integrated manufacturing (CIM), concurrent engineering, and enterprise re-engineering. The field is poised to tackle some fundamental barriers of integration and thereby effect a new quantum jump in overall productivity, where information will become a fourth basic factor of production along with land, labor and capital. Among the barriers are the lack of information technology enabling multiple systems operating concurrently over different geographical regions. This paper discusses a unique approach to the integration problem regarding information resources management, global query and concurrent systems administration. This approach is based on the metadatabase model which incorporates both data and knowledge in order to accomplish information integration across manufacturing functions. Basic concepts, methods and techniques have been developed for the approach and verified via a prototype metadatabase system. The system's primary components and major functionalities are discussed and illustrated in detail through the use of an extended example of a pilot manufacturing system comprising order processing, process design and shop floor control. It will also provide the reader with a simulated system demonstration.

This paper explores the value of a strategic approach to CIM implementation, which has been proposed as a means of overcoming such problems. Drawing on case material the paper examines implementation as a social and political process, in which strategic objectives are sometimes obscured by functional, professional and individual interests. In conclusion, the paper argues for the development of more politically and socially informed models of strategy and CIM development.

A risk-averse, conservative strategy may be a safe route, but might lead to missing marketplace opportunities. This paper investigates whether a hostile business environment adversely affects either a firm's rate of technological innovation or its rate of success with new product launches. It also examines what successful innovating firms do, in terms of strategic posture and organizational structure, to adapt to hostile conditions. A model depicting relationships between environmental conditions, firm responses, innovation rates, and new product success was constructed and tested in an empirical study of 142 U.S. firms involved in technological innovation. The final section discusses managerial implications of the findings.

J	GOODMAN, EC				GOODMAN, EC			RECORDS MANAGEMENT AS AN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINE - A CASE-STUDY FROM SMITHKLINE-BEECHAM-PHARMACEUTICALS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							FUTURE	This paper discusses records management within the context of information management as a whole. It begins with some definitions of records management, indicating how the adoption of a more active a more active approach to the management of records can position it as an information management discipline. This concept is then developed by describing the strategic part which records management can play in an organization; how the skills and professional qualifications of records managers have evolved and need to continue to do so to meet this challenging role; and indeed how records managers can apply their emerging skills to add value to the organization's strategic development. SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals' Research and Development Document Management Department is described, together with case studies from other organizations, to illustrate these discussions.

J	MORGAN, G				MORGAN, G			PROBLEMS OF INTEGRATION AND DIFFERENTIATION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF BANCASSURANCE	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article								The article examines the development of 'bancassurance' operations in the UK. It considers the competitive and regulatory pressures which have contributed to these developments. It argues that there is a continuum in terms of the integration Of banking and insurance. In the UK case, full bancassurance remains the prerogative mainly of the retail banks; the majority of building societies remain as 'tied agencies' which do not allow the full strategic integration which is at the core of bancassurance. However, there are strong indications that the larger societies see these problems and intend to move to full bancassurance, a process that may be assisted by the entry of European insurers as partners in this process. 'Putting bancassurance into operation' is a complex process as insurance selling continues to be seen as a distinctive skill needing to be differentiated from traditional deposit-taking functions. The paper reviews three cases which differ markedly in terms of how they seek to balance the conflicting pressures of integration and differentiation. In the final section, it emphasises the need to create integration as fundamental to the customer's experience of bancassurance.									BURTON D, 1991, INT J BANK MARK, V9, P25; Channon D.

J	Rands, T				Rands, T.			A framework for managing software make or buy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							VERTICAL INTEGRATION; DECISIONS	Whilst research highlights the strategic importance of make or buy policies for goods and services, studies reveal that managers often treat make or buy as an operational issue. In the case of software, although make or buy decisions are crucial in determining the outcome of IT applications, little research into software make or buy has been undertaken. A framework for managing software make or buy is proposed within which software make or buy policies are formulated, based on the strategic importance of applications, and the relative skills of internal and external software sources. The planning of internal software development resources results in firms developing specialised skills, in response to increasing specialisation in the software market.

J	FINNEGAN, P; FAHY, MJ				FINNEGAN, P; FAHY, MJ			PLANNING FOR INFORMATION-SYSTEMS RESOURCES	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; MIS; IMPLEMENTATION; EXECUTIVES	Increasingly, organizations are looking towards IS planning in an effort to force information technology to live up to its heralded promise. Many of these are finding that their efforts are resulting more in disappointment than in organizational advantage. This article reviews the principles of information systems planning and reports the practices found in organizations. The authors argue that these practices lack the high level direction required to achieve mastery in the area. To rectify this, they propose a four-tier planning framework for information technology, information systems, and information management. This framework provides guidance for an integrated approach to the management of an organization's information and technology resources by promoting the development of a planning platform from which consolidated planning can take place at operational, tactical, and strategic levels.

Last year the forest industries accounted for half of Finland's exports. Finland is the world's second biggest exporter of paper and board. The present study deals with a Finnish expert analysis of different strategic courses of action concerning the whole forest industry sector. In the study a decision support method called 'AHP' (analytic hierarchy process) has been applied. This method makes it possible to evaluate several strategies and to synthesize qualitative and quantitative factors in the decision-making process. The method also gives an opportunity to test how sensitive the strategies are in relation to critical factors. Based on the study it has been possible to draw conclusions concerning the most recommendable strategic course for the Finnish forest industries.

Firms enter simultaneously in stage 1 by paying a fixed cost, and they choose output levels sequentially in subsequent stages. At the subgame-perfect equilibrium of the game, the production level of a firm is decreasing with the order of the firm in the decision-making. The firm that is the last to choose output produces the same amount as a typical firm in the standard symmetric simultaneous-moves Cournot game. Moreover, industry output and market price are identical in the sequential and the symmetric Cournot games. It follows that in the sequential game there are fewer active firms and higher total surplus than in the standard symmetric Cournot game. Strategic asymmetry results in higher concentration and higher total surplus without an increase in price!

DIVERSIFICATION AS A STRATEGIC PREEMPTIVE WEAPON	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article							CONTINUOUS-TIME; ENTRY; INVESTMENT; PERSISTENCE; REPUTATION; EXIT	This article examines the role that multimarket operations play in a firm's abiIity to preempt entry into new markets when presence in a market does not commit the firm to remain there. Success in one market affects a firm's incentives and, in turn, strategic power, to fight a rival fur survival in a related market. This is modeled as a way of attrition, and the risk-dominant equilibrium is derived. The model supports brand proliferation as a credible preemptive strategy for an established firm and also has implications regarding the strategic role of economies of scope and "deep pockets."

Within the multi-product batch manufacturing environment, effective control is a highly complex task, as short-term fluctuations in sales volume and product mix must be met by the manufacturing system in response to business and marketing requirements. In this paper the authors consider typical production control strategies within this environment and apply an analytic investigation incorporating steady-state queueing theory to illustrate the variations in scheduling effectiveness, plant layout and work-in-progress costs affecting production performance.

It is shown that R&D investments to develop a backstop technology can be used as a credible threat to induce a low price profile for the resource. The price path associated with the unique perfect equilibrium exhibits limit pricing: The backstop is eventually introduced but in a period before this event, the cartel keeps the price sufficiently low to make delayed investment the preferred alternative for the consuming nations.

The planning required to deal with the budget crises presents opportunities for change that can evolve the foundations for a New American University. Such a university will require strong and integrated strategic planning, entrepreneurial leaders, cost-conscious programs of quality, leaner administrations, integrated management of programs, partnerships with society, changes in the scope and evaluation of faculty scholarship, and strong telecommunications networks. Faculty members and administrators from schools of pharmacy, by addressing these and other change issues, have the opportunity to help create change through innovation and leadership within their school and the university as well. The effort needed for such actions will be revolutionary, yet evolutionary.			KINNARD, WJ (corresponding author), UNIV MARYLAND,SCH PHARM,20 N PINE ST,BALTIMORE,MD 21201, USA.

Rockart and Scott Morton have proposed that information technology (IT) may have an essential role in organizational change. However, only a few researchers have studied MIS/D in the context of organizational development. Most of the research has been based on technological imperative. If an organizational imperative is adopted this leads to the consideration of the use of IT in the context of organization development. At present organizations are developing their strategies for the 1990's which demand structural changes or at least development of the organization's control and decision-making processes. The essential point is that the changes also effect the information needs of organizational actors. Thus, organizational change quite often requires the existing information systems to be reconstructed or even replaced. For MIS/DSS development the establishment of new information channels offers a challenging task. In this study a process approach to the analysis of the relationship of OD and MIS/DSS development is applied. The change process in a Finnish public-sector organization is observed in a longitudinal manner. In the first phase of this study the author's role was to assist in aligning the planning of a single information system - Workplace Information System (WIS) - with other organizational change processes. Empirical data was gathered through action research. One of the most important findings of this study was that new WIS options were created through organizational learning.

J	KIRK, R				KIRK, R			THE BIG PICTURE - TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT	JOURNAL OF NURSING ADMINISTRATION			English	Article								The pressure to improve the quality of clinical and customer service outcomes continues to escalate. In most cases, sustained improvement (either incremental or breakthrough) is a direct result of improving service delivery and work processes. The challenge, for managers, is to design work processes that predictably lead to satisfying and cost-effective results. Total quality management (TQM) and continuous quality improvement (CQI) may seem like "this year's fads" but they are from, not fashion. TQM and CQI processes generate a customer-responsive environment in which employees can contribute to achieving the organization's mission, vision and strategic objectives.

J	DUMOND, J				DUMOND, J			IN A MULTI-RESOURCE ENVIRONMENT, HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article								One of the important elements of strategic management is to establish resource levels over the long run-capacity planning. More specifically, managers are faced with the need to determine resource levels that are sufficient to meet corporate objectives and remain competitive; and, yet, not excessive. This research has explored the relationship between ten different availability levels of resources in a constrained, multiple resource environment and their impact on project completion times and promise date performance measures. It also evaluated four finite scheduling heuristics which use a finite scheduling system and are used to estimate and, then, meet a project's completion date in the dynamic, multi-project environment. As a part of the discussion we examine the tradeoff between project completion times and resource availability levels. This research has found that (1) three of the four tested finite scheduling heuristics can produce/meet very good promise dates; (2) resources do not need to be provided in quantities that exceed 160% of system requirements; (3) when resources are provided at the 130% or greater level, all four heuristics perform equally well with regard to completion times, and complete projects at less than one and a half times a project's critical path time; and (4) when resources are greatly constrained (110% to 130%) the effects are significant and the choice of heuristic is very important.

As such it addresses the classical problem of the storage of energy produced from such renewable sources as hydroelectric plants, windmills, and solar cells. Such sources are used to provide power to produce electrolytic aluminium. After storage and transportation, the aluminium can be burned, using a catalysts, to produce power where and when necessary using modified combustors in conventional thermoelectric power stations. The paper concludes with a discussion concerning how improvements can be made to the overall economics of electricity power generation, storage and distribution.

J	PIZEY, H; HUXHAM, C				PIZEY, H; HUXHAM, C			1990 AND BEYOND - DEVELOPING A PROCESS FOR GROUP DECISION SUPPORT IN LARGE-SCALE EVENT PLANNING	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						GROUP DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS; MULTI-ORGANIZATION; LARGE SCALE EVENT; PUBLIC SECTOR; SODA	SYSTEMS; WORK	The mounting of a Large Scale Event (LSE) (such as an Olympics or Expo) in a city or country can be much more than an end in itself. Such an event also provides many opportunities for long-term development. This paper describes a Group Decision Support System (GDSS) for assisting decision makers in local public sector organisations to make use of the opportunities provided by the staging of such an event. A general conceptualisation of the GDSS approach is described prior to outlining its application to the management of a specific large scale event, Glasgow 1990. The approach, developed from an established strategic management methodology, SODA, is designed to take account of the unique aspects of large scale event management, which tend to be multi-organisational in nature. As a result of this emphasis the GDSS approach pays more attention to group and meta-process issues, compared to other approaches which are more technology oriented. The Jelassi and Beauclair framework for classifying GDSS provides a useful means of describing these main differences. Glasgow 1990 provides a specific application for evaluating the approach, the results of which suggest that in similar solutions GDSS need a wider focus including group and meta-process aspects. As the GDSS described incorporates this wider focus, it may have applications in situations other than large scale event management.

The methodology of structured content analysis of published articles is used to examine 132 papers presented at international conferences and published in journals. Emerging from the debate, twenty three frequently raised issues are identified and ranked. Countries of authors of these papers have been ranked according to the importance of information technology in their international trade. The most frequently addressed multinational issues, important from the perspective of less developed countries, are: Information Technology Aid, Employment Creation with Information Technology, Indigenous Information Technology, Regional Information Technology Cooperation, High Cost of Information technology, Training of Information Technologists, Domination by Multinational Corporations, and Domination by Industrialized Countries. Twenty three issues identified from the study are categorized as Perceived Advantages, Perceived Disadvantages, and Implementation Issues. The challenges and opportunities created by the eight most important issues for U.S. multinational corporations in computer industry are also discussed.

A conceptual framework is proposed involving multiple rationalities and meta-rational relationships. Conflicting prescriptions are recast as conflicts between alternative forms of rationality. The framework is operationalised, producing (i) a structured set of diagnostic questions and (ii) a means to identify situations where there is only limited scope for further technical decision analysis. Some implications for strategic decision-support-systems are outlined, and comparable theories and techniques are discussed.

These discussions describe very different views of what is meant by strategic IS use. This paper clarifies the concept of strategic use of the IS resource and identifies the issues to address in using the IS resource as a strategic business factor.

J	Baligh, HH				Baligh, Helmy H.			DECISION RULE THEORY AND ITS USE IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE ORGANIZATION'S PERFORMANCE	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						DECISION RULES; STRUCTURE; PERFORMANCE PROPERTIES		The specific nature of decision rules and the pattern of connections they create between people help determine the performance of an organization. To show these casual connections, decision rules are rigorously defined and their algebraic structure explored. Properties of decision rules and of structure performance are then operationally defined. A number of propositions connecting decision rule properties to performance properties are made, their meanings investigated, and their truths supported by logical arguments. The relations of these newly defined properties to others in the literature are explored and used to restate and integrate together some of the literature's vague and isolated generalizations.

The Impact of Information Management on the Organization: Two Scenarios	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						information management; organization design; decision making		A concept called information management has been discussed for many years by computer and management scientists. Implementing this concept may revolutionize organizations and have a profound effect on organizational decision making. Since the technology needed to implement sophisticated information systems is now available, managers need to address the potential impact of this innovation on their organizations. This article presents two scenarios that may help managers to anticipate the effect of information management on organizational decision making.

J	Highsmith, J				Highsmith, Jim			Structured Systems Planning	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Systems planning; structured techniques; strategic planning; operational planning		Information systems planning is of growing interest to many MIS practitioners. This article postulates that one key element missing from most literature on systems planning is the transition from a strategic plan to an executable, operational plan. The article then describes the application of "structured" tools and methodology to assist in improving this transition task. The process and the examples explained in the article were taken from the author's experience in implementing them while at Oglethorpe Power Corporation in Atlanta, Georgia.

J	Koch, HS				Koch, Harvey S.			Online Computer Auditing Through Continuous and Intermittent Simulation	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Computer auditing; internal auditing; online auditing; internal controls; parallel simulation		A new computer auditing technique, called Continuous and Intermittent Simulation (CIS), is introduced. It has been specifically designed as a compliance auditing technique for timesharing systems that can be used to audit internal controls. CIS is an auditing technique that simulates the instruction execution of the application at the time the application is processing a transaction. All data and input to the application is accessible by and shared with the simulation. This means that the simulation is notified about each transaction that is entered to the application and accesses to the database by the DBMS. It is not necessary for all transactions to be audited in order to have the capability of performing online auditing. Before any updates are made to the database, or before any output is returned to the users, the simulation can verify the results by executing the appropriate instructions that evaluate the internal controls of the application. If an inconsistency is found, all pertinent information about the system's status can be put into the exception log. The simulation can then choose to use the results computed by the application or by the simulation, or choose not to use any of the results, as if there was no transaction.

J	Davis, RK				Davis, Richard K.			STRATEGIC, TACTICAL, AND OPERATIONAL PLANNING AND BUDGETING: A STUDY OF DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM EVOLUTION	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Decision support system; planning and budgeting; farm programs; Department of Agriculture; interactive software; on-line systems; database systems; management information systems		This paper describes the evolution of a planning and budgeting decision support system. The system supports farm program planning and budgeting within the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Online interactive techniques are used through the Foresight planning and System 2000 database software. Numerous extensions of these techniques are formulated and comparisons made with industry. The study probes the nature of the system development process in a highly volatile environment, and the psychological motives of the professionals involved. The forces at work are generalized to fit other environments. The results shed light on how other successful systems might be developed employing similar methods and techniques. Future extensions of this system and new scenarios are postulated and generalized in order to provide a basic framework for analysis of key decision support functions.
