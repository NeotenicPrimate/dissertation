J	Hartley, M				Hartley, Matthew			Leading Grassroots Change in the Academy: Strategic and Ideological Adaptation in the Civic Engagement Movement	JOURNAL OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational change; social movements; grassroots leadership; civic engagement		This article examines the challenges and opportunities of leading broad-based change. It examines the civic engagement movement in American higher education over the past three decades, an effort that began with a number of small uncoordinated efforts and evolved into a major national effort involving tens of thousands of faculty and administrators and spurring change at more than a thousand colleges and universities in the United States. The analysis focuses on the critically important role that leaders have played in advancing these efforts, a factor that has received scant attention by social movement theorists. The article describes how leaders attempted to build networks and also points to the challenges of negotiating ideological tensions that inevitably emerged as the movement grew and evolved.

The industrial ecosystem balanced scorecard	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						strategic management; balanced scorecard; BSC; industrial ecology; industrial ecosystem; industrial ecosystem balanced scorecard; IEBSC		The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is among the central concepts in strategic management. The four Industrial Ecosystem Principles (IEPs) are among the central theoretical constructs in industrial ecology. This theoretical contribution applies the BSC approach to IEPs to construct an Industrial Ecosystem Balanced Scorecard (IEBSC). BSC breaks the strategy of the organisation down to four interdependent perspectives. The Industrial Ecosystem (IE) is divided into four perspectives according to the four IEPs. The IEPs are roundput (materials cycles, energy cascades), diversity (in the involved actors/organisations), cooperation/symbiosis (cooperation in their relations) and locality in product life cycles. In BSC, two criteria are employed to evaluate the perspectives of the organisation's scorecard: the strategic vision and the financial perspective. In IEBSC, the strategic vision and overall objective is ecological sustainability. Sustainability principles (the strategic vision) and roundput (the central IEP perspective) are used to assess the diversity, cooperation/symbiosis and locality in IEBSC. The cause-and-effect chains and interdependencies between the four IEPs are identified. We innovate by linking the engineering and natural science-derived IEPs with the management and organisational models of the BSC that introduce strategic thinking to industrial ecology. The four IEPs can now be used complementarily. The IEBSC further illustrates how the cause-and-effect chains between the four IEPs may actually create unsustainable solutions and environmentally harmful outcomes.

Our proposition is a global approach that enables technical data to be managed and used throughout the product life cycle. This approach aimed to provide assistance for costing, development and the industrialization of the product, and for the capitalization, the reuse and the extension of fundamental knowledge. This approach has been experimented within a company environment that designs and produces families of ship equipment parts.

Using ERP Systems to Transform Business Processes: A Case Study at a Precession Engineering Company	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Enterprise resource planning; Business process; Information system; Inventory management; Case study		Enterprises nowadays strive to keep transforming their business processes in accordance with the fast-changing customer demands so as to survive the intense global competition. In an attempt to provide practitioners with an insight into ERP implementation and the resulting business performances, this paper investigate how a successful ERP implementation can help transform enterprises processes. Case based research which is based on an in-depth observation under managerial and practitioner situation. A case study at a precession engineering company is conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed strategic enterprise information model. This paper focuses on the implementation of Sales & Marketing and Warehouse modules of an ERP system. The key performance indicators are used to evaluate how the ERP implementation can improve the business processes. It is found that ERP helps to improve data visibility and improve on-time delivery but less effective on improving employee productivity. This research proposes an enterprise information model to exploit what strategy should be formulate and how ERP tactic can be implemented in company to enhance enterprise competitive advantages.

J	Papazissimou, L; Georgopoulos, A				Papazissimou, Lucas G.; Georgopoulos, Antonios			Customer-driven philosophy in the banking industry under different ownership status: the case of Greece	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article						relationship banking philosophy; customer retention; information technology; relationship marketing; Greece	PRIVATIZATION; PERFORMANCE; CULTURES; PRIVATE; FOREIGN	Relationship banking (RB) philosophy has become a topic of increasing importance in strategic marketing management. RB concerns inter alia the applying of customer-driven strategies using advanced information technology. This study investigates RB in the Greek banking industry overall and also under different ownership status (privately owned vs. stated-controlled vs. foreign banks). Based on a wide field of research during the period 2005-2006, indeed, we find that banks in Greece apply the philosophy of RB; however, privately owned and foreign banks implement RB strategies more systematically and effectively in comparison with state-controlled banks. The usefulness of our results is twofold: they satisfactorily justify the considerable growth of the private banking sector in the Greek economy and significantly enrich the service-profit chain of this specific industry.

For many years the region has suffered from inequities and inequalities regarding the availability and accessibility of a regional healthcare system, resulting in high mortality and morbidity rates and low quality of life.The aim of the healthcare strategic plan was to suggest initiatives and actions to be taken in order to improve healthcare provision and the health and wellbeing of local residents.

J	Robertson, CJ; Guerrero, CNS				Robertson, Christopher J.; Suarez Guerrero, Cristobal Nico			An empirical test of Peruvian subcultural values	CROSS CULTURAL MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Peru; National cultures; Social values; Developing countries; Multi-national companies	UNITED-STATES; WORK VALUES; CULTURES-CONSEQUENCES; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; CHINA; INDIVIDUALISM; COLLECTIVISM; GENERATION; FRAMEWORK	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a value measurement tool based on an indigenous theory of cultural values. Moreover, this instrument was tested in a multi-cultural sample from Peru. Design/methodology/approach - A cultural values framework that traces its origins to Peru is employed as the conceptual foundation for a new instrument designed to measure values that are inherently linked to economic and social development. The survey is tested across diverse subcultures within Peru through 288 respondents. Findings - The empirical results lend significant support to three hypotheses and a number of differences related to how certain values may be perceived in varying subcultural communities were identified. Perhaps the most striking finding is that Peruvians from different subcultural groups vary in their perceptions of which values are key to successful assimilation into the local indigenous communities as well as the values necessary for achieving success in international business. Research limitations/implications - By developing and testing a developmental values instrument that was based on developing nation constructs we have created an opportunity for replication in other developing nations as well as industrialized economies. Practical implications - A number of implications related to managing in Andean America are plausible. These results can assist multi-national firms that elect to operate in the Andes to evaluate their marketing and sales approaches, as well as human resource management policies. In addition firms that seek new growth opportunities within Andean America may need to incorporate predetermined values that are germane to their potential strategic maneuvers in the region. Originality/value - This paper is exploratory in nature and facilitates a deeper level of analysis related to subcultural values in developing nations.

Extrapolation of site-specific weighted usable area curves and instream flow requirements to unmeasured streams within the Nooksack watershed in support of strategic watershed planning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Stratification; hydrologic classification; geomorphologic classification; extrapolation; instream flow requirements; weighted usable area curves	TRANSPORT	Given the large number of locations within the study watershed (Washington, USA) where instream flow information is required, a GIS based stratification procedure using multivariate data analysis techniques was developed to extrapolate either instream flow recommendations or habitat availability curves (weighted usable area curves) upon which instream flow recommendations could be developed from study sites to other sites where no site-specific information is available. One-hundred-seventy-two drainages were divided into 21 hydrologically and geomorphologically similar subgroups. Mean annual flow versus drainage area and 60% exceedence flow versus drainage area relationships were also developed for the study area. Monthly instream flow recommendations were then extrapolated to the unmeasured streams within the hydrologically and geomorphologically similar subgroups by scaling them by a percentage of the mean annual flow; weighted usable area curves were extrapolated to the unmeasured streams within the same subgroups by scaling the flows by a percentage of the 60% exceedence flow. Extrapolated monthly instream flow recommendations ranged between 0 and 76 percent but were generally within about 20 percent or less when compared to recommendations developed from site-specific analyses. Extrapolated weighted usable area relationships had an average root mean square error less than about 17% and reflected the basic functional relationships when compared to site specific analyses. This study demonstrates that either instream flow recommendations or weighted useable area relationships derived from site-specific data can be extrapolated to unmeasured sites for use within the context of strategic watershed planning based on the development and application of two extrapolation methodologies.

J	Storey, A				Storey, Anne			How fares the 'New Professionalism' in schools? Findings from the 'State of the Nation' project	CURRICULUM JOURNAL			English	Article						CPD; culture change in teaching; New Professionalism; performance management; 'State of the Nation' study	TEACHERS; ENTERPRISE	In a series of policy documents over the past decade, the idea of a 'New Professionalism' for teachers has been constructed. It encompasses three core components: a national framework of professional standards; performance management; and continuing professional development (CPD). The planned interplay of these components into a coherent whole has been at the heart of a reframing of the teacher's role. While much has been said about the vision in both positive and negative terms, few studies have provided empirical insight into the implementation and experience of this policy. Drawing upon the findings of a TDA-funded nationwide (England) research project, the extent to which these ideas and policies have been adopted in practice, and what implications these actual behaviours carry for the debate about 'New Professionalism', are assessed. A key finding was that while the framework of professional standards and the structures of performance management processes were essentially in place, the third plinth of the New Professionalism, CPD, remains mainly as a bolt-on, pragmatically allocated and inconsistently accessed in schools. As such, it is unable to bear the weight of what is required of it, and claimed for it. The widespread failure to tackle the strategic dimension that links performance management to CPD, to engage in criterion-based evaluation of training or to identify appropriate development opportunities in schools, have all tended to obstruct the road to 'New Professionalism'.

J	Crainich, D; Leleu, H; Mauleon, A				Crainich, David; Leleu, Herve; Mauleon, Ana			The optimality of hospital financing system: the role of physician-manager interactions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE FINANCE & ECONOMICS			English	Article						Hospital's financing system; Strategic interaction; Prospective payment system	REIMBURSEMENT; SERVICES	The ability of a prospective payment system to ensure an optimal level of both quality and cost reducing activities in the hospital industry has been stressed by Ma (Ma, J Econ Manage Strategy 8(2):93-112, 1994) whose analysis assumes that decisions about quality and costs are made by a single agent. This paper examines whether this result holds when the main decisions made within the hospital are shared between physicians (quality of treatment) and hospital managers (cost reduction). Ma's conclusions appear to be relevant in the US context (where the hospital managers pay the whole cost of treatment). Nonetheless, when physicians partly reimburse hospitals for the treatment cost as it is the case in many European countries, we show that the ability of a prospective payment system to achieve both objectives is sensitive to the type of interaction (simultaneous, sequential or joint decision-making) between the agents. Our analysis suggests that regulation policies in the hospital sector should not be exclusively focused on the financing system but should also take the interaction between physicians and hospital managers into account.

The environments in which this innovation occurs is usually uncertain, therefore, many companies performtechnological forecasting in association with their technological innovation processes. While many researchers have studied the innovation process and many more forecasting methods, there is little research connecting the two within the strategic context of the firm. To do this, a model of the forecasting process is needed. The purpose of this paper is to present a model based on a literature review. Previous models which formed the basis for the proposed model will be discussed followed by an explanation of the model and conclusion. Finally, a case study is presented to observe and test the proposed model.

Knowledge Management Implementation: Modeling the Barriers	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Driving power; dependence power; interpretive structural modeling; knowledge management implementation; knowledge management barriers		The purpose of this paper is to present an approach to successful KM implementation by understanding the dynamics among various knowledge management barriers (KMBs) that hinder the implement of KM in organisations. Using interpretive structural modeling (ISM), the research presents a hierarchy-based model and the mutual relationship among the KMBs. The research shows that there is a group of KMBs having high driving power and low dependence which require maximum attention and are of strategic importance. Another group consists of those KMBs which have high dependence and low driving power which necessitate the resultant actions. This categorisation provides a useful tool to top management to differentiate between independent and dependent KMBs and their mutual relationships which would help them to focus on those key KMBs that are most significant for effective KM implementation. Arrangement of KMBs in a hierarchy and the categorisation into driver and dependent categories is an exclusive effort in the area of KM implementation.

Employees' encounters with aspects of the work environment, such as work-related stressors and the nature of work tasks can influence their satisfaction. Research presented in this paper indicates the existence of a personal or dispositional component to job satisfaction, especially in a work environment that has been affected by the transition process in East Europe. During this time most public companies were privatised and as a result, have adopted downsizing strategies. In the post-downsizing era, applying appropriate human resource management practices to motivate employees and to regain their trust is a critical issue to increase job satisfaction that can lead to higher work performances. The findings of the research presented in this paper provide important implications for both the research field and practical management of human resource development, employee motivation and strategic HRM practices.

A Construct for Building the Capacity of Community-Based Initiatives in Racial and Ethnic Communities: A Qualitative Cross-Case Analysis	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE			English	Article						community capacity; community health; community organizing; program implementation; public health initiatives	PROGRAM	Objective: This article reports on a qualitative study that contrasts implementation patterns across community-based public health initiatives, resulting in a construct for building the capacity of such initiatives in racial and ethnic communities. By specifying which capacities provide optimum leverage, community initiatives may increase precision in developing intervention strategies that are pivotal in producing desired outcomes, Method: Cross-case comparisons were made on the basis of intensive interviews with key initiative leaders. Results: Several capacities distinguish highly successful initiatives from those that had greater difficulty in realizing their goals. Leadership was the most important distinguishing capacity. Organizing capacity, or the propensity to provide structure, operational procedures, oversight, and activity formation, was also critical in leveraging community action and desired outcomes. Conclusion: The study concludes that developing high levels of community capacity where it can produce the most strategic advantage is a promising pathway for mitigating antagonistic social factors.

J	Graham, IW; Jack, E				Graham, Iain W.; Jack, Eleanor			Promoting leadership: the development of a nurse executive team in an acute hospital trust	JOURNAL OF NURSING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						corporate development; health care change; leadership characteristics; nursing service		Aim The purpose of this study was to evaluate how an executive nursing team, within an acute hospital trust in the south of England, developed their leadership characteristics through the use of a professional development programme. Background This paper offers an insight into how this team worked together to clarify their views of their new role and how the role would be enacted. Method A questionnaire using quantitative and qualitative measures was used to explore the group's leadership style and evaluate the professional development programme. Findings The findings show how the development programme worked and what clarity it afforded the group in terms of their leadership style. Group work, building on the findings, helped them define their particular characteristics, skills and leadership ability and what further work was needed to demonstrate this. Conclusions The issues raised, such as team-working, mutual purpose and personal development, are discussed in terms of their function within an integrated executive team with vision and goals. Implications for nursing management In ensuring that the nursing service has positive purpose, direction and goals, there needs to be a strategic approach to corporate development; otherwise, nursing will struggle to lead itself within a fast changing health care system.

Analyzing price and product strategies with a comprehensive system dynamics model - A case study from the capital goods industry	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Applications of System Dynamics in Marketing	JUN, 2007	Cornell Univ, Johnson Sch Management, Ithaca, NY		Cornell Univ, Johnson Sch Management	price strategy; product strategy; system dynamics; case study; capital goods		Price reductions and/or product enhancements are widely seen as appropriate ways to increase market share. However, the key findings of this analysis demonstrate the opposite: decreases in price combined with product enhancements can lead to substantial loss in sales revenue and, ultimately, profit. The discussion draws on findings from a comprehensive system dynamics model, which has been developed in a major company in the capital goods industry, The purpose of this research is to analyze the price and product strategies in the capital goods industry. In the case company, testing intuitive beliefs with the help of a formal system dynamics model proved to be beneficial in the strategic decision-making process. The model had a significant impact on the case company, especially when challenging basic assumptions about mechanisms of markets and competition. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The analysis against e-government success factors finds seven "critical issues"; political timing, resource allocation, political mandate, distinction between administrative and political responsibilities, coordination of departments, dependence on providers, and use of standards. We found these issues open for local choice, influences of strong individuals and groups, and chance. This is a consequence of the prevailing strategic model for the public sector, New Public Management, which leaves these issues to be filled by negotiations among many actors with different roles, goals, and action space. The general lesson is that there is a need for practical ways of acting strategically to reduce the risk level and increase the ability to implement policy.

J	Onishi, M; Sasaki, M; Nagata, A; Kanda, K				Onishi, Mami; Sasaki, Minako; Nagata, Ayako; Kanda, Katsuya			Development of nurses with specialties: the nurse administrators' perspective	JOURNAL OF NURSING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						competency; human resource development; human resource utilization; nurse with specialty; professional experience		Aim This study clarified how Japanese nurse administrators consider the current status and future prospects of development and utilization of nurses with specialties. Background The demand for specialized nurses is not satisfied throughout the country. Methods Nine nurse administrators participated in three focus-group discussions. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis technique. Results On development of specialized nurses, four categories were abstracted: offering opportunities for career development; establishing an environment of life-term continuous learning; providing well-balanced support for the needs of organizations and individual nurses; and support for career development as a specialist. Conclusions To develop specialized nurses effectively it is important to focus more attention on qualitative aspects of nurses' professional experience in in-service education and to support appropriate personnel for strategic human resource development. Implications for Nursing Management Facilitating frequent contacts between specialized and general nurses should be highly valued as making an environment where nurses can face career goals daily leads to steady preservation of human resources. It is necessary for nurse administrators to keep human resources quantitatively and to clarify the developmental process after nurses obtain special roles to plan for continuous education.

J	FitzGerald, G; Tippettt, V; Schuetz, M; Pollard, C				FitzGerald, Gerry; Tippettt, Vivienne; Schuetz, Michael; Pollard, Cliff			The Queensland Trauma Plan Project	ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						injury; trauma; trauma centre; trauma system		Background: The aim of this paper is to outline the development of 'A Trauma Plan for Queensland'. Injury is one of Australia's National Health Priorities. The full impact of injury, including early death, reduction in quality of life and the social and emotional costs to individuals and the community are immeasurable. The direct health-care costs alone amounted to A$4.13bn in 2000-2001. Queensland has one of the highest rates of injury in Australia. An estimated 1500 Queenslanders die each year as a result of major traumatic injury and it is the single most common cause of death between the ages of I and 35 years. Methods: The Queensland Trauma Plan was based on a detailed analysis of the management and outcome of trauma in Queensland and used an extensive process of stakeholder consultation to identify proposals for system improvement. Sequential workshops helped identify the issues and strategies for system improvement. These proposals were condensed into a high-level strategic plan, which has now been endorsed by the Queensland Government. Results: The Trauma Plan identifies service enhancements and the improved coordination required to support ongoing policy development, research and education. The Plan outlines a future direction for the development of trauma services and the system and structures required to support that development. Conclusion: The Trauma Plan holds potential as a model for the development of future trauma services and injury prevention programmes. The process shows the value of engagement of clinicians and others into the policy development and planning processes. The Outcome reinforces the value of taking a whole Of community, coordinated and collaborative approach to injury prevention and management.

J	Goldman, A				Goldman, Alan			Consultant and critics on the couch	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INQUIRY			English	Article						organizational toxins; toxic leadership; toxin detection; management consultant		The process of situating the "client on the couch" also entails the seating of "consultant and critics on the couch" as they participate in a self-reflective and dialectical process. The author argues the importance of strategic use of the "toxicity" metaphor and the central role of an initially qualitative lens via corporate cases and narrative investigations into dark side, destructive behavior in companies. Central to the study of toxicity is the blending of micro and macro, as individual psychology and systemic company-wide perspectives are fused into consulting and coaching hybrids. The patience of an anthropologist is required for the consultant facing thick, textured cases of organizational and leadership toxicity, and similar emotional intelligence is depicted as essential for a bridging of both qualitative and metric-driven streams of consultation and research.

J	van der Laan, L				van der Laan, Luke			The Imperative of Strategic Foresight to Strategic Thinking	JOURNAL OF FUTURES STUDIES			English	Article						strategic foresight; strategic leadership; strategic thinking; futures studies	FUTURE; LEADERSHIP	An apparent gap in mainstream strategy literature points to questions relating to the role and competencies of leaders in strategy making. An initial investigation reveals that turbulent change and growing environmental uncertainty demands leadership intuition and skills that are able to anticipate aspects of the future, provide enabling environments significantly different to the recent past and to provide direction for a dynamic 'living organisational strategy'. The paper explores the relation between neuroses of thinking about the future, the roles of leaders, strategic foresight and their connectedness to expanding bottom line measures of organisational performance. These are seen as indicators of leadership skills required to embrace the future and the possible foundations of an imperative for strategic foresight education in leadership development.

J	Cavanaugh, JC; Gelles, MG; Reyes, G; Civiello, CL; Zahner, M				Cavanaugh, John C.; Gelles, Michael G.; Reyes, Gilbert; Civiello, Cathleen L.; Zahner, Mary			Effectively Planning for and Managing Major Disasters	PSYCHOLOGIST-MANAGER JOURNAL			English	Article								The impact of recent major disasters has driven home the need for psychologist managers to incorporate disaster planning and planning for continuity of operations into their organizations' strategic planning. As a result, the Society of Psychologists in Management (SPIM) has included key sessions on this topic on the agendas of their annual conferences. This article summarizes a session from the 2007 conference that included a keynote talk by John Cavanaugh, PhD, based on an article previously published in this journal (Cavanaugh, 2006) and his subsequent additional disaster preparation and response experience. The session also included a panel discussion that explored applying and adapting lessons learned from hurricane disasters to other types of disaster situations. Gilbert Reyes, PhD, was invited to participate on this panel because of his renowned expertise in international disaster planning and response. His four volume book on international disaster psychology (Reyes & Jacobs, 2005) provides a thorough discussion of this topic. Michael Gelles, PsyD, ABPP, was invited to participate on the panel because of the clarity with which he and a coauthor described preparing for and dealing with an organizational threat (Turner & Gelles, 2003) and because of his expertise in planning for and responding to terrorist events. Cathleen Civiello, PhD, ABPP, facilitated the panel because she, along with Drs. Gelles and Reyes, had presented an indepth institute on disaster and continuity of operations planning at the 2006 SPIM conference. Mary Zahner, PhD, played a significant role in identifying the critical lessons for psychologist managers included in this article.

J	Macario, R				Macario, Rosario			Airports of the future: essentials for a renewed business model	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH			English	Article						Airport; Airlines; Quality; Business Models		This paper addresses the interaction between airports and airline companies taking into account the evolution of air transport in the last decades and an approach to integrated quality of service. Traditionally airport management, just like all transport infrastructure management, use to look at airlines as their primary customers, due to their legally binding agreements and because airlines pay for several charges, such as landing and parking fees, charges per passenger or tonne of freight handled, etc. Airlines, in turn, have legally binding agreements with passengers and look at passengers as their primary clients. In their unconscious business models airports used to see themselves as providers of an high technological demanding infrastructure, of national strategic interest, for very sophisticated operations where safety played both a very distinguished and distinct role. This paper challenges this traditional airport model and discusses a renewed business model for airports. This renewed model maintains the key functions of an airport but is built in the concept of quality of service as an interactive process that encompasses all agents engaged in the provision of the service.

We model the competition between a Large Producer and Consortium of producers in a two-tier supply chain as a game and characterize the resulting Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium. Our results demonstrate that as the costs of inputs to production increase, there are greater returns to ownership of a private exchange. Further, we demonstrate strong welfare enhancing effects of the PEM as the production efficiency of upstream suppliers declines. Finally, from a policy standpoint we show that when upstream suppliers are highly efficient, the creation of a private electronic exchange by the Large Producer will result in significant welfare loss.

J	Haigh, N				Haigh, N.			A view backstage of climate change environmental markets	AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						climate change; environmental markets; institutional entrepreneurship; political activity		Complementary to others focusing on how organisations engage with environmental markets because they emerge through changing consumer preferences or sustainability principles, this article offers an alternative view, showing there is much more going on behind the scenes. A look backstage of the electricity supply industry finds a highly managed strategic effort on the part of large companies to influence regulations and the market creation process. European and US companies' engagement with climate-change-related markets, such as emissions trading and carbon offsets, are reviewed and compared with the response from organisations in Australia's electricity supply industry to climate-change issues.

J	Hung, P; Low, GC				Hung, Patrick; Low, Graham Cedric			Factors affecting the buy vs build decision in large Australian organisations	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						success factors; buy vs build; package acquisition; software packages; in-house development	ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS; SOFTWARE; CRITERIA; MODEL	When developing an information system, organisations are faced with a fundamental choice: to buy a pre-developed package (potentially customise it or redesign/reengineer the business processes of the company concerned to fit the package), or to build the system in-house. Past literature has indicated the importance of the buy vs build decision to the organisation even suggesting that correctly managing the choice could be the key to managing IT. This research aims to identify the factors that an organisation should consider when making an information systems buy vs build decision. Interviews were conducted with 10 organisations across a spread of industries, involving key strategic IT decision-making personnel at the senior IT executive level. By examining the operational approaches adopted in each of these organisations and the key drivers behind these approaches, we identify the core factors that affect real-world buy vs build decisions in large Australian organisations with a turnover in excess of $750 million. We found that a number of core factors - strategy, commodity and competitive advantage, maturity, cost and requirements fit - critically affect buy vs build, while peripheral factors - risk, time and timing, political factors, and ongoing support - are secondary considerations.

J	Caro, DHJ				Caro, Denis H. J.			Deconstructing symbiotic dyadic e-health networks: Transnational and transgenic perspectives	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						symbiotic dyadic e-health networks; relational capital; transformational skills; transnational perspectives; transgenic dimension	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS DESIGN; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; TELEMEDICINE; TRUST	The 21st century continues to witness the transformation of organizational systems globally through the deployment of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The health care sector is no exception to the inter-organizational dynamics driven by ICT innovations, such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, nomadic information systems and nano-technology. This study explores inter-sectorial informational network dynamics by extending Zhu's Wu-Shi-Ren (WSR)-Li framework into the Realpolitik of e-health systems transnationally. This key informant study of the perceptions of inter-sectorial executives engaged in evolving symbiotic dyadic e-health networks in Canada, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom appears to support Zhu's WSR-Li model. A key finding of this study is that relational and transactional capital and transformational competencies are essential to the evolution of such e-networks, but they are not sufficient. These components must transcend the boundaries of the dyadic e-networks to engage and integrate transcendent forces in the form of public governance agents rooted in larger socio-political environments. In effect, information system professionals must acquire transcendent knowledge and skill sets to engage the "transgenic" forces, or key socio-political elements, that are critical in evolving inter-sectorial e-networks. Engaging and co-opting these transgenic forces appears to be particularly important in national health care systems, where public governance is a key socio-political value. This underscores the need for further research to explore how transgenic forces influence the evolution of a range of ICT systems inter-sectorially in different socio-political environments.

J	Hill, A				Hill, Alex			How to organise operations: Focusing or splitting?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						focusing; splitting; operations strategy	STRATEGY	The concept of focus has been proposed as a method for operations to achieve superior performance by concentrating its resources on accomplishing one strategic task. Since its development by Skinner [1974. The focused factory. Harvard Business Review May-June, 113-121], it has become a key element within the operations strategy field. Despite the high level of adoption and investigation into the subject, there still seems to be little empirical support for the focus concept [Vokurka, R.J., Davis, R.A., 2000. Focused factories: empirical study of structural and performance differences. Production and Inventory Management Journal 4](1), 44-55] and a feeling that we still do not adequately understand its application in industry [Ketokivi, M., Jokinen, M., 2006. Strategy, uncertainty and the focused factory in international process manufacturing. Journal of Operations Management 24(3), 250-270]. This case-study-based research paper examines three organisations, that have organised their operations using four different approaches, to understand the advantages and disadvantages they bring. The findings show that some approaches (process and product/market) do not fully reduce the level of complexity within operations, whilst others do (market order-winner and qualifier/performance objectives). It is therefore proposed that some approaches should be re-classified as "splitting" rather than "focusing." (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lewis, C				Lewis, Chris			Are house fires changing?	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article								NSWFB Fire Investigation and Research Unit continually undertake case study analyses of significant house fires. This analysis and recent statistical analysis of fire services response data indicate that the effectiveness of containing a fire to the object or room of origin has deteriorated slightly over the last five years. This domestic research resonates with fire research from other countries showing a possible increase in speed and ferocity of experimental domestic fires. Furthermore, this is supported by a survey of the perceptions of operational firefighters within the NSW Fire Brigades. If confirmed, this emergent trend in domestic fires will present an ever increasing risk to the life safety of both building occupants and firefighters. To test this hypothesis NSW Fire Brigades has entered into a collaborative project with CSIRO to research changes in the residential environment in Class 1a dwellings (houses), looking in particular at changes over the last three decades that may affect life safety outcomes for residents and firefighters exposed to residential fires. This article will outline the findings and outcomes of stage one of this research and briefly discuss the implications of applied research in gathering evidence for the design, implementation and evaluation of strategic fire prevention policy.

ENERGY USE AND RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS IN CEE COUNTRIES	LATVIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND TECHNICAL SCIENCES			English	Article								Nowadays, the efficiency of energy use in the Central and East-European (CEE) countries is insufficient, being much lower than in the "Old Europe". The problem becomes increasingly pressing due to non-stop increasing prices of energy carriers (especially of crude oil). The authors trace the development of research activities in this sphere, classifying the revealed changes in parameters of energy consumption processes in particular time intervals into deterministic, probabilistic, and fuzzy. The paper presents a thorough analysis of decision-making in the energy management at its different levels - normative, strategic, and operative. Particular attention is given to the management under uncertainty conditions - i.e. to the risk management. The most wanted research directions in this area proposed by the energy and environment policy (EEP) Center specially created for CEE countries concern management under risk connected with innovations, international activities, loss of reputation, etc.. The authors consider in detail the risk management with insufficient knowledge (non-knowledge) and under chaos. Much consideration is given to the scenario management and the game theory principles as related to the sphere of energy use.

The role of quality improvement initiatives in healthcare operational environments Changes, challenges and responses	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE			English	Article						Health services sector; Environmental management; Strategic choices; Quality management	MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; PERFORMANCE; SERVICE; TQM; ADVANTAGE; IMPACT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to shed some light on the utilization of quality improvement initiatives in healthcare operational environments. In the process, environmental changes and strategic responses are examined for a sample of healthcare organizations. Design/methodology/approach - A survey-based research methodology is utilized in this study. Factor analysis is used to extract relevant factors representing environmental changes and strategic options relevant to healthcare organizations. In addition, simple percentages are utilized to assess the extent of implementation and effectiveness of quality improvement initiatives. Findings - In general, the findings appear to indicate that the studied organizations have achieved both operational and strategic benefits due to the effective implementation of quality improvement initiatives. The implementation of quality improvement initiatives appears to be in response to environmental changes and challenges faced by healthcare organizations. Practical implications - Based on the findings of this study, decision-makers are encouraged to commit organizational resources toward the effective implementation of quality improvement initiatives. Investing in quality improvement not only is justified, but also appears to be very much needed in a changing competitive environment. Originality/value - This study contributes to enhancing one's practical and theoretical understanding of the competitive impact of quality improvement initiatives in different operational settings.

Reforming public sector Facing the challenges of effective human resource development policy in Ghana	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Public sector reform; Human resource development; Local government; Ghana		Purpose - This paper seeks to explore and understand the public sector reform (PSR) as it affects local governments in Ghana within the context of challenges facing human resource capacity building and development policies. Design/methodology/approach - Adopting an exploratory case study design, the research triangulated both secondary and primary sources of data. Primary data generated from self-completing questionnaire and interview schedule tools covering 105 local government employees selected from national, regional and district levels. Semi-structured interviews also solicited views from 16 senior public officers and managers in nine public and quasi-public organizations. These primary sources were complemented with relevant secondary documents from the organizations investigated. Findings - Amongst others, it was found that Ghana's PSR has significantly influenced the strategic direction of human resource development policies of the decentralized local government service. Major human resource capacity challenges manifest three-dimensionally as: policy, task/skill/organization and performance motivation induced. Practical implications - Addressing the human resource capacity challenges has enormous strategic and financial resource implications for policy makers in transition and developing economies, due to their over-reliance on external donors for funding. Originality/value - Unlike previous studies, this empirical study did not explore human resource capacity issues of elected officials; rather, it focused on public servants (technocrats) implementing local political decisions. Of much value is that the results were from the perspective of the frontline local government staff whose day-to-day inputs are critical for effective decentralization.	[Antwi, K.

The strategic flexibilities of modular product designs can help organisations prepare for an uncertain future, but managers must develop ways to imagine possible futures in order to use such flexibilities to respond to them. This paper discusses a scenario-based approach to anticipating and responding to uncertain futures by developing modular products that increase a firm's chances of succeeding in multiple alternative futures. After introducing the theoretical basis of this study, a structured approach to operationalising the generation of future scenarios and the development of modular product designs is developed. The approach consists of four stages: (1) the generation of scenarios about future market needs, (2) the translation of those needs into goals for modular designs, (3) the modular design process itself and (4) the evaluation of the modular design process. The modular design process we discuss is a function-based design approach that is form independent and thus allows joint consideration of future market needs and the product functions that can serve those needs. We illustrate our proposed approach by applying it to generate scenarios and modular design criteria for the Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) market in the security equipment sector in Turkey.

Quality of care and racial health disparities: A strategic overview	MOUNT SINAI JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM; INTERVENTIONS; COMMUNITIES	Substantial racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care exist in the United States. The Department of Health Policy at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine has developed a strategy for reducing those disparities that builds upon its quality improvement experience. This article discusses the utility of applying quality improvement principles to the development of interventions to eliminate Underuse of effective treatments and reduce the disparities that may arise from this quality problem. We present a conceptual model of racial disparities in health and Our Underuse hypothesis. Parallels between our disparities research strategy and six sigma quality improvement methods are described. Finally, the article provides an example of how we have been able to successfully implement proven-effective health improvement programs in the Harlem community even after grant funding has ended.

J	Colla, E; Lapoule, P				Colla, Enrico; Lapoule, Paul			Banning below-cost resale in France: the impact on pricing decisions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETAIL & DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Pricing; Pricing policy; Legislation; France		Purpose - In France, the consumer prices of major industrial brands have been rising for a number of years, while the price differential between these brands and the retailers' ones has widened. These consequences were attributed to the French legislation, particularly to the Galland Act, enacted in 1996, which regulated the banning of below cost resale. The aim of this paper is to explain the effects of the legislation on price competition within the grocery sector and to analyse the effects of the Dutreil Act, enacted in 2005, which modified the Galland Act. Design/methodology/approach - The paper carried out an analysis of economic, strategic and marketing literature, as well as professional surveys, statistical data, balance sheets of the main retail groups and the authors did some interviews with retail and industry professionals. Findings - This paper highlights the fact that, although price competition has been partially restored by the Dutreil Act (2005), the latter still has had some very negative consequences on industry/distribution relationships, on negotiations and on development of retailers' expertise. According to the authors, the same consequences will continue in the future, even after the new Chatel Act enactment (December 2007), unless the government will modify the existing regulation of negotiations. Research limitations/implications - The empirical data that would enable an evaluation of the impact of the legislation - such as retail prices and gross margins of different kinds of brands and retail formats, specially the size of merchandising and promotion fees (marges arrieres) - are limited (and some of them controversial). Moreover, the explanation given in the paper is not sufficient to distinguish the inflationary impact of the legislation from that of other factors, which may have contributed to the same effect. Originality/value - The main value of the paper is the explanation of the continuous negative impact - in terms of transaction costs and juridical risks - of legislation on negotiation practices between industry and distribution. The paper highlights the links between legislation, the negotiation practices and the price definition by retail and manufacturing firms.

Although various quality improvement projects are routinely deployed by the healthcare professional, they are characterised by a fragmented approach, i.e. they are not linked with the strategic intent of the organisation. This study introduces a framework which integrates all quality improvement projects with the strategic intent of the organisation. It first derives the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) matrix of the system with the involvement of the concerned stakeholders (clinical professional), which helps identify a few projects, the implementation of which ensures achievement of desired quality. The projects are then prioritised using the analytic hierarchy process with the involvement of the concerned stakeholders (clinical professionals) and implemented in order to improve system performance. The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated using a case study in the intensive care unit of Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Bridgetown, Barbados.

J	Moreira, PMD				dos Santos Moreira, Pedro Miguel			Characterising human resources management practices in Portugal: an empirical analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						human resources practices; Portugal; strategic human resource; work organisation	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; TOTAL QUALITY; PERFORMANCE; MOTIVATION	The importance of human resources as a fundamental channel towards the competitiveness and sustainability of firms is now theoretically unchallenged. This article provides an overall characterisation of the main human resources management (HRM) practices implemented in Portugal and compares them with the benchmark models proposed in the literature. To evaluate the degree to which HRM practices diverge from these benchmark models, this article relies on the analysis of five criteria: i) How do the main HRM practices fit the existing management models (familiar, professional or mixed); ii) How does the HRM conform to a work organisation of the matricial type; iii) To identify whether the role of HRM is essentially administrative or strategic; iv) To identify where the responsibility for HRM lies within the firms operating in Portugal; and v) To characterise the relation between HRM and work organisation in Portugal. Drawing on a representative sample of firms operating in Portugal, we identify three clusters that allow us to characterise and analyse the stylised HRM practices implemented in Portugal (network-based, familiar-based or bureaucratised). Results show contrasting management patterns, which can be interpreted as different stages of evolution in terms of HRM practices in Portugal.

The training needs of the staff who work in specialist CAMHS are not always clear or prioritised, due to the complexities and differing contexts in which specialist CAMHS are provided. The aim of this paper was to establish stakeholders' experiences of service complexities and challenges that affect training within specialist CAMHS. The project employed interviews to gain wide-ranging consultation with key stakeholder groups. The sample consisted of 45 participants recruited from policy departments, professional bodies, higher education providers, commissioners, service managers, and practitioners. The participants identified a number of themes that limit training, and put forward solutions on how these could be facilitated in the future. Emerging themes related to leadership and the role of service managers, strategic management of training, commissioning, levels of staff training, resources, impact of training on service users, and availability of training programmes. The findings emphasise the need for the strategic workforce planning of training to meet service delivery goals. Policy, commissioning, workforce training strategies, service needs, and delivery of training should be integrated and closely linked.

J	Goldman, EF				Goldman, Ellen F.			Integrating work experiences into teaching	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Teaching; Experience; Management strategy; Learning	STRATEGIC THINKING	Purpose - Management educators are criticized for not maximizing the use of students' work experiences in the classroom. This paper aims to demonstrate how knowledge gained from work experiences can be organized into a teaching taxonomy and transformed into teaching strategies. The exemplar of learning to think strategically is used to illustrate the process. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reframes how teaching taxonomies can be developed and how teaching strategies that use work experiences can be created. Findings - The paper finds that knowledge gained from work experiences and the associated learning methods that created that knowledge, can be matched to required domain knowledge to form a teaching taxonomy and to develop teaching strategies. Practical implications - The paper presents a way to develop a teaching taxonomy that assists management educators in selecting teaching strategies that both use students' work experiences and are specific to the content to be learned. Originality/value - The paper offers a new framework and process for using workplace experiences in classroom teaching.

Practices' competitive benefits are reported at the aggregated level of practice categories and illustrated with a selected category of individual practices. Findings - The model was supported by the study's results by providing connections suggested in the model but not previously corroborated in the literature. The cost source of sustainable competitive advantage was a dominant empirical competitive mode for CREM, as it was in the model. Categories of technical CREM practices providing competitive advantage were shown to be practices for "location/siteselection", "workplace styles" and "corporate finance for CRE". Research limitations/implications - The research's relatively small sample of organisations meant that not all practices were evident. However, the study does establish the model's usefulness for evaluating CREM's alignment with organisations' modes of competition. Practical implications - For CRE and its management to fully support a competitive organisation it is essential that CREM practices align with that organisation's competitive positioning. This research evaluated a framework for CRE managers to do this. Originality/value - CRE, its management, and their connections to competitiveness have seldom been studied but are important as CRE is an organisations' second largest resource. This paper's model is a significant advance in frameworks linking CREM practices to organisational competitiveness for both practitioners and also further theoretical work in the area.

J	Isomursu, M				Isomursu, Minna			Tags and the City	PSYCHNOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						mixed reality; NFC; tags; physical browsing		This paper analyzes the findings of a set of field studies that explored the use of near field communication (NFC) tags in a mixed reality environment for providing access to digital services by touching a tag with a mobile phone. The field studies provide insight into user experience, usability, user acceptance and technical implementation issues that need to be considered when designing tag-based services. The paper proposes that if NFC technology becomes common, there is a compelling need for methods and practices for tag management. If such practices are not used and available, tags can form "tag litter" that ruins the user experience by corrupting the trust towards tags and tag-based services.

J	Koo, LC; Koo, H; Luk, L				Koo, L.

This approach combines the application of a few powerful strategic tools to reap synergetic benefits. Innovative strategic approaches are regularly invented, introduced and adopted with mixed outcomes. It is important to be able to accurately, flexibly and systematically ascertain the internal corporate status and evaluate its business environment. Borrowing from the quality management practices, i.e., failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), a parallel analogy termed success mode and effects analysis (SMEA) is introduced to supplement the scanning of external environment. Two indexes [i.e., risk priority number (RPN) and opportunity priority number (OPN)] are introduced in the strategic formulation process to estimate the quantum of favourableness or unfavourableness of various external factors. The holistic strategic formulation approach as adopted by the consumer product manufacturer deploys the application of SWOT, balanced scorecard (BSC) and blue ocean strategy (BOS).	[Koo, L.

The models are constructed for analyzing the macro- and firm-level environments in the international pulp and paper industry. Design/methodology/approach - The data for the evaluation were collected through a field survey in 13 publicly-noted Finnish companies, with a total of 36 respondents. All the respondents were involved in business intelligence or corporate development related tasks. Findings - The results indicate that, the respondents appreciated the capabilities of both SOM models. All of the factors relating to accuracy, content, format, timeliness, and usability for strategic decision making received ratings higher than neutral. Respondents also concluded that the SOM models have additional benefits compared to currently used methods. Finally, the respondents were willing to utilize the SOM as a complement to other tools for analyzing the competitive environment. Some subfactors of the firm level SOM model received statistically higher averages than the macro-level SOM model. Originality/value - Despite the SOM having been utilized in thousands of different applications, user satisfaction with the SOM and its information products has not previously been widely evaluated, especially not by potential end-users.

J	Lowe, GF				Lowe, Gregory Ferrell			Customer Differentiation and Interaction: Two CRM Challenges for Public Service Broadcasters	JOURNAL OF MEDIA BUSINESS STUDIES			English	Article						customer relationship management; public service broadcasting; segmentation; interaction and dialogue; innovation		As public service broadcasting becomes less distinctly non-commercial if nonetheless non-profit, customer relationship management offers useful concepts and tools for the modernization of PSB strategies and the transformation of work cultures. It also poses contradictions with principles that are fundamental to the PSB ethos. This article treats two aspects of CRM in PSB, positioned as challenges for development. While the principle of "customer differentiation" has operational value it is conceptually problematic with regard to universalism. Interaction poses no conceptual problems and connects well with the PSB ethos but is operationally problematic given traditional barriers to collaboration.

J	Mahnke, V; Overby, ML				Mahnke, Volker; Overby, Mikkel Lucas			Failure sources in R&D consortia: the case of mobile service development	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						alliance process; innovation; R&D consortia	INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES; MARKET PIONEER ADVANTAGES; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; FUTURE-DIRECTIONS; GOODS INDUSTRIES; COOPERATION; INFORMATION	This study reveals the processes through which firms can cope with sources of failure in R&D consortia in emerging high-tech markets. We use a single case design, focusing on mobile service development to investigate the value-creating and value-dissipating activities in a R&D consortium. We collected longitudinal data on the collaborative processes in the alliance through semi-structured interviews, observations and archival researches for over 24 months. The findings suggest that R&D consortia increase the chances of success, when diverging interest can be mitigated, cognition can be aligned and agreement on time preferences can be reached. We also find that if attempts to manage such challenges are ill-timed in the process phases of strategic imagination, common ground development, coordinating contributions and performance. the success of R&D consortia is called into question, because the participants maximize their private benefits at the expense of the common ones. We conclude with managerial implications, which suggest a simple, yet integrative framework for managing R&D consortia ill the context of service development, and offer fruitful future research avenues.

J	Orlova, AV				Orlova, Alexandra V.			Russia's anti-money laundering regime: law enforcement tool or instrument of domestic control?	JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL			English	Article						Russia; Money laundering; Regulation; Banks; Financial management		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to cut through the rhetoric that shrouds Russia's anti-money laundering regime to uncover the reality that lies beneath. Design/methodology/approach - This paper relies on both primary and secondary sources inRussian andEnglish that dealwith the problems of money laundering in theRussian context. Relevant sections of the Russian Criminal Code as well as Russia's anti-money laundering regulations have been consulted. Findings - Overall, the Russian anti-money laundering regime has thus far proved ineffective in terms of meeting its stated purposes of combating organized crime and terrorism. Its limited success stems largely from structural weaknesses in the Russian banking system as well as that industry's lack of a culture of regulatory compliance. Moreover, Russian authorities have opportunistically seized on the current anti-money laundering regime as a useful tool in the pursuit of ends unconnected to the fight against organized crime and terrorism. The Russian authorities have used the regime to attempt to reform the banking system and to extend their strategic control in the domestic political and business realms. The ineffectiveness of the anti-money laundering regulations and their usage to achieve ulterior aims undermine the legitimacy of the regime as a whole. Originality/value - The paper looks beyond the technical difficulties in applying the anti-money laundering regulations and examines the misuses of the anti-money laundering regime in the Russian context. However, the problems raised in the paper are not unique to Russia and have relevance to other jurisdictions, especially countries that are members of the Financial Action Task Force.

A generic scalable simulation model for strategic supply chain management with emphasis on production activities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Systems Management	MAY 16-19, 2005	Marrakech, MOROCCO			supply chain redesign; multi-site enterprises; discrete-event simulation; production activities; inventory policies		In this paper, we describe a generic scalable simulation model for the redesign of the supply chain of multi-site enterprises. Our model makes it possible to reproduce the dynamic of the supply chain and the information and material flows between its various entities. In particular, we concentrate on the modelling of the activities which take place both in and between the production and distribution centres. The model is designed to provide an in-depth evaluation of the effectiveness of different network designs and to settle various management policies. We illustrate the benefit of using this simulation model for redesigning a real life problem.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 148 post-graduate students in management responded to a questionnaire online. Two cluster analyses were performed to identify dispute resolution patterns and organizational dispute states. Then, cross tabulation between the two clusters was performed (Pearson's chi-square coefficient and Sommer's D statistic). Findings - Cluster analyses identified three styles of dispute resolution pattern - interest-based, based on controlled power, and power-based - and three different organizational dispute states: harmony, dissonance, and conflict. Finally, the influence of resolution patterns on dispute states was been confirmed by the cross tabulation. Research limitations/implications - Firstly, Ury et al's theoretical typology should be revised, especially for the rights-based approach. Secondly, the results of our cluster analysis indicate that it might not be necessary to measure the emotional and behavioral dimension of conflict separately. Thirdly, our research confirms the impact of conflict management on conflicts at work. Practical implications - The results show that dispute resolution patterns have a non-negligible influence on organizational conflict states. In order to increase the likelihood of a harmony state, an interest-based dispute resolution pattern should be adopted. Originality/value - First, the statistical technique used - cluster analysis - is somewhat innovative. Secondly, this research shows that dispute resolution patterns may affect organizational dispute states.

With the increase in offshore IT/IS operations, a growing number of companies are encountering negative experiences and unpredicted results. The analysis performed in this article reveals the possible risks and perceived success factors of companies outsourcing IT/IS operations offshore. The major points of interest are operational and strategic risks; legal contracts; cultural, security, and financial issues; and noted success factors by companies that participate in offshore outsourcing. The research indicates the importance of risk identification and the formulation of strategic plans that include preventive, detective, and corrective control methods of implementation and evaluation. Effective methods and metrics for measuring the success or failure of IT/IS offshore outsourcing operations is expected to be a continuing development with the increasing growth of this phenomenon.

J	Stelfox, P				Stelfox, Peter			Investigative Practice and Performance Management: Making the Marriage Work	POLICING-A JOURNAL OF POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article								Peter Stelfox is Head of Investigative Practice at the National Policing Improvement Agency. In this article, he examines the relationship between investigative practice and performance management. Criminal investigation is one of the key strategic functions of the police service. The service's capacity to investigate crime entirely comprises the skills, knowledge and experience of investigators. Other resources, such as intelligence databases and forensic science are important, but without skilled investigators who know how to use them, they are of little value on their own. Performance management should enable the service to focus this capacity on delivering a quality service to society. However, emerging evidence suggests that the way in which some managers have implemented performance management measures is having a detrimental effect on the service's ability to investigate crime effectively. This paper examines how this has happened and the steps that could be taken to improve the situation. These include better dialogue between managers and investigators and improved management practice.

J	Wisansing, J				Wisansing, Jutamas (Jan)			The Three Waves of Internationalisation Sweeping Thailand's Tourism and Hospitality Education: Current Progress and Future Prospects	JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY & TOURISM EDUCATION			English	Article						Tourism and Hospitality Education; Internationalisation; Strategy; Thailand		In this article, the context of international education and various aspects of internationalising education from regional and global perspectives are discussed. These situations have significant strategic implications for the pursuit of international tourism and hospitality education in Thailand. The main objective of the article is to explore the various approaches to how tourism and hospitality programs in Thailand have started to internationalise themselves. It also examines the existing dual/joint programs that have been started, and discuss how Thailand has looked to "import" western courses, and how it now intends to "export" them to its neighbours. This article provides a picture of the current state of affairs which indicate that extensive and various forms of joint activities are being undertaken between higher education institutions within and outside Thailand in the development of tourism courses and programmes. Despite these positive endeavours, it is obvious that monitoring and evaluation in these areas needs to be further conducted. On the whole, this paper offers a prominent preliminary evaluation, which reveals that Thailand tourism and hospitality education institutions are making impressive efforts to internationalise tourism higher education.

FIRM PATENT STRATEGIES IN US TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						American National Standards Institute; Federal Trade Commission; Firm patent strategies; intellectual property rights; knowledge-based view; patents; Standards Development Organisations; Technology standards	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; KNOWLEDGE-BASED THEORY	The focus of this article is on exploring the business competitive consequences of firm patent strategies in the United States de jure technology standard development processes. An analytic framework ("Firm Patent Strategies Matrix") is created which formally identifies a set of firm patent strategies applicable in the de jure technology standard development process. This Firm Patent Strategies Matrix is predicated on two key variables relevant to the standard development process: first, firms are either active participants in standard-setting committees, or they are non-participants, and second, firms are either disclosing appropriate information on potentially relevant patented technology (or patent pending applications on such technology), or they are not disclosing such potentially relevant patented information on technology (or patent pending applications on such technology), in the standard development process. The Firm Patent Strategies Matrix identifies the following four generic strategic choices for a technology-driven firm to choose among concerning the disposition of its patents: (1) Disclosure/Participation, (2) Disclosure/Non-Participation, (3) Non-Disclosure/Participation, and (4) Non-Disclosure/Non-Participation. Public policy issues, relevant to these Firm Patent Strategies, are identified (e.g., RAND licencing terms, patent ambush and submarine patents) and recommended policy solutions are offered (e.g., instituting Ex Ante royalty discussions, vigorous federal antitrust enforcement against patent ambush and the wider use of firm patent liability insurance, respectively).

J	Montgomery, JD				Montgomery, James D.			The structure of norms and relations in patronage systems	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						patronage; norms; moral dilemmas; algebraic methods	BALANCE; NETWORKS; KINSHIP; MODEL; LOGIC	Patronage systems are composed of a social relation (between patron and client), the norms associated with this relation (support, defend, not attack), and network-formation rules (governing the creation of patronage ties). Actors in a patronage system face moral dilemmas when they become obligated to fight on both sides of a conflict, and patronage systems are normatively consistent when these dilemmas can never arise. This paper examines the structure of normatively consistent patronage systems, exploring the logical relationships among norms and between norms and network structure.

J	Gallaugher, J				Gallaugher, John			Strategic Positioning and Resource-Based Thinking: Cutting Through the Haze of Punditry to Understand Factors Behind Sustainable, Successful Internet Businesses	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						competitive advantage; e-commerce strategy; resource-based theory; strategic information systems; strategic positioning	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; ADVANTAGE	This article synthesizes and leverages two strategic frameworks when analyzing the true nature of strategy and the Internet: (1) the concept of strategic positioning, and (2) the resource-based view of the firm. When considered together, these approaches create a powerful tool for understanding the factors determining the winners and losers among Internet businesses. Several examples of the applied framework are demonstrated. These frameworks also help challenge broken thought around many of the postbubble assertions regarding strategy and the Internet. This analysis is based on a series of case studies, with information drawn both from secondary sources as well as over 60 field visits with senior managers at technology firms in Seattle, Silicon Valley, and Tokyo conducted from 2005-2006.

J	Sherer, SA				Sherer, Susan A.			Comparative study of IT investment management processes in US and Portugal	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						IT business case generation; IT investment management; IT investment selection; IT value realization; national culture; power distance; uncertainty avoidance	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT; CULTURES-CONSEQUENCES; SYSTEMS RESEARCH; GOVERNANCE; STRATEGY	This article investigates IT investment management processes in the U.S. and Portugal. In Portugal compared to the United States, we find less involvement of operational business users, less formalized processes, more bottom-up generation of ideas, less focus on business metrics other than financial ones, and more highly involved corporate boards. We develop a framework for understanding IT investment that includes five stages: idea generation, business case generation, investment selection, project implementation, and value realization. Several of Hofstede's factors are used to explain national cultural differences in each of these stages. Cultures with high power distance involve fewer business line employees in idea generation, fewer operational business managers selecting investments, and more centrally managed project implementations. In cultures with high uncertainty avoidance, fewer large scale strategic project ideas are generated and there is a stronger emphasis on financial criteria in information technology investment selection.

J	Lin, CH; Hsu, ML				Lin, Cinho; Hsu, Ming-Lung			A GDSS for ranking a firm's core capability strategies	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						core capability; strategic business unit; strategic business area; Value chain; Analytic Hierarchy Process; Genetic Algorithm	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; USEFUL PERSPECTIVE; BUSINESS	Strategic management is a key activity for organizations' ability to sustain competitive advantages in the long-term. It is crucial for enterprises to optimize their strategies in order to build unique competencies. However, the complex and uncertain environment of modem organizations create difficulties in the evaluation of relevant factors while formulating strategies. In addition, most firms lack cognition and consensus in developing their core capabilities which are vital to attaining competitive advantage. Hence, it is necessary to find more efficient ways by leveraging information technology. Specifically, these problems can be solved by implementing IT-based group decision support systems (GDSS), which are rarely explored. Therefore, the study develops a group decision support system in which the cluster analysis, genetic algorithms, and Analytic Hierarchy Process are used to help managers make key decisions. The system provides a flexible and user-friendly environment to help top management and other relevant staff to evaluate all relevant factors in formulating development policies for core capabilities. Furthermore, in the case study of the GDSS, the participating managers view it as a useful and user-friendly approach to facilitate this task.

The different perceptions of the population dynamics processes emerging from these relationships lead to a range of potential scenarios for future development of the stock. Optimized strategic choices vary between exploitation at fishing mortality (F) of 0.25 and 0.45, with substantial differences in long-term yield depending primarily on the validity of the underlying stock-recruitment relationship. A detailed evaluation of the consequences for management in the short, medium and long term is presented. The uncertainty in stock dynamics and the strategic options are discussed along with the consequences for potential yield caused by the choice between management options. The study includes an evaluation showing that it may take at least ten years of exploitation at reduced yield before the current uncertainties about stock productivity might be resolved.

J	van Assen, MALM; van de Rijt, A				van Assen, M. A. L. M.; van de Rijt, Arnout			Dynamic exchange networks	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						exchange networks; network evolution	RATIONAL-CHOICE MODEL; SOCIAL POWER; FORMAL THEORY; COMMITMENT	Considering the theoretical and empirical untenability of static exchange networks, researchers have asked how exchange outcomes change when links are added or deleted. The present paper assesses the validity of seemingly sensible propositions concerning the effects of adding and deleting a link on (i) the payoffs of the actors in the link, (ii) the payoffs of actors in neighboring links and (iii) the variance of payoffs in the exchange network. The propositions were examined by applying expected value theory (EVT) to all 13,597 networks up to size 8. All propositions were falsified. Some falsifications of propositions could be attributed to EVTs prediction that actors use sub-optimal exchange relations. Since other well-known theories of exchange, like power-dependence theory and network exchange theory, also predict that actors use sub-optimal relations, these results are robust to selection of the theory of exchange.

It is assumed that the strategic position of any firm will always tend to deteriorate under the combined influences of strategic regression and market competition. Any firm adopting a status quo strategy will be Subjected to a dynamic drift that will funnel it through a field vortex leading to a black hole, i.e., a no-return zone. The best long-term Sustainable growth strategy that any firm Could adopt is along the strategic regression line, i.e., a trajectory of equal growth rates in market potential and resources mobilization.

Data was collected using postal questionnaires and interviews. From the statistical tests done on the data, it was found that variation in certain firm-characteristics influenced the value the respondents attached to certain resources. In addition, the more housing segments the developers operated, the more emphasis are given to organisational strategy and policies. There is an inverted-U relationship between product diversification and trade secrets and innovation, with the maximum value at four housing segments. The housing developers that practise strategic management emphasised significantly more on management expertise and experience than those that did not. No variation in the value attached to resources was found when the other two firm characteristics, i.e. legal status and geographical diversification, were examined. Given the small number of companies that participated in the study, the results should be treated with circumspect. What the study provided though are grounds for more in-depth study to be conducted.

J	Albors, J; Hervas, JL				Albors, Jose; Hervas, Jose Luis			Cl practice in Spain: its role as a strategic tool for the firm. Empirical evidence from the CINet survey analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International CINet Conference	SEP 22-25, 2004	Sydney, AUSTRALIA			continuous improvement (CI); strategy; motivation		This article presents an analysis of the CINet survey results in Spain. Although Spain is a newcomer to Continuous Improvement (CI) practices, globalisation has stressed the need to raise the level of the firms' competitiveness in order to compete worldwide. As a consequence, the use of ISO tools has been intensely disseminated. The survey presented a modified model of CI evolution. It outlines the relevance of CI practices as a strategic tool confirming previous studies. After analysing the survey results, a factor analysis identified various critical variables. The size of the firm, management support of CI with resources, the individual CI culture, organisation structure, the use of CI tools and the experience with CI, as well as the time dedicated to CI practice, explained the sample variance. A cluster of CI excellence was detected composed of firms partially related to the automotive industry; firms with a higher CI performance also showed higher levels of productivity.

J	Andersen, HJ				Andersen, H. J.			The issue 'Raw milk quality' from the point of view of a major dairy industry	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND FEED SCIENCES			English	Article						raw milk quality; consumer; traceability; sustainability; animal welfare; nutrigenomics		The mission of Aria Foods is to provide modern consumers with milk-based products that create inspiration, confidence and well-being. Consequently, Aria Foods continuously needs to obtain and implement all necessary knowledge of relevance for controlling the quality of our products. The ongoing dramatic changes in the international market place, caused by global changes in lifestyles and requirements of consumers, require high standards of quality assurance regarding diversity, quality and safety of products and the environmental, ethic and animal welfare aspects of the food production. Consequently, the need for inclusion of the whole food production chain to develop strategies for production of foods with high quality has never been more urgent. Even though raw milk quality has always been a cornerstone for Arla Foods, the above-mentioned requirements of the modern consumer request a constant expansion of our raw milk quality concept of a major dairy industry towards issues of importance for the consumers. Thus, raw milk quality cannot contain only quality characteristics that just meet statutory quality requirements and quality characteristics of importance for the settling price of the dairy farmers. Consequently, Arla Foods has recently implemented a quality assurance programme called Arlagarden, which includes quality requirements compatible to those that also satisfy consumer demand for "soft" values, i.e. the consumers can be assured that Aria Foods is consistently concerned with the proper exploitation of resources, the environment, animal welfare, ethics etc. throughout the entire production process. Nevertheless, Arla Foods will continuously need to obtain new knowledge to expand the raw milk quality term as our fulfilment of the company mission is continuously challenged by new demands from our costumers including the modern consumer. This calls for strategic multi-disciplinary research of importance for raw milk quality, which can further improve quality assurance programmes for raw milk production in the years to come. This includes research, which additionally can I. develop sustainable management systems, 2. make nutrigenomics in relation to animal health functional in management decision systems, 3. combine raw milk composition and human health, 4. improve milking systems, handling and storage of raw milk, 5. improve hygienic design at the modern milk farm, 6. develop simulation models of importance for developing effective hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP) concepts, and finally, 7. develop robust and sensitive inand at-line methods including microbial rapid methods applicable at all stages of the milk chain. These areas of research are briefly described in relation to the urgent needs of a major dairy company of tomorrow.

J	Austin, SA; Thorpe, A; Root, D; Thomson, D; Hammond, J				Austin, Simon A.; Thorpe, Anthony; Root, David; Thomson, Derek; Hammond, Jamie			Integrated collaborative design	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Design management; Supply chain management; Integration		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe an approach to managing the supply chain from the perspective of design which the paper refers to as integrated collaborative design (ICD). Design/methodology/approach - Building on a substantial program of research using a range of methodologies previously reported, the concept of a design chain is described the argument is made that the industry needs to center the development of integrated teams (as proposed in accelerating change) around collaborative working of all parties involved in the design process. Findings - The research recognizes that the construction sector is too often focused on the short-term objectives of projects, rather than long-term business strategy and organizational relationships. The ICD approach involves three steps: identifying tasks (process management); allocating roles (as part of supply chain management); and focusing design solutions to deliver value. Originality/value - The paper outlines the principles and approach to ICD and provides a strategic overview within which various techniques and practices can be utilized to integrate organizations and more effectively manage the design process.

J	Balan, S; Vrat, P; Kumar, P				Balan, S.; Vrat, Prem; Kumar, Pradeep			A strategic decision model for the justification of supply chain as a means to improve national development index	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						modified Brown-Gibson (MBG) model; analytical hierarchical process (AHP); supply chain management index (SCMI); national development index (NDI)		A country's economy can be justified by many economic means. In this paper, it is proposed that supply chain as a means to develop a national economy. The analysis is carried out with three alternatives: supply chain, quality of life and economic conditions. A Modified Brown-Gibson (MBG) model is proposed by considering objective (Internal Factors (IF) affecting supply chain), subjective (External factors affecting supply chain) and Risk Factors (RFs) (Risk associated with supply chain). In this strategic decision-making model, the objective factors are measured from the indices of the best indicators of the world economy. The Subjective Factor (SF) measure is performed using the rating approach of the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). A detailed sensitivity analysis is carried out by changing the objective factor decision weight, the priority weight of SFs and also by changing the Gain Factors (GFs). The result of the analysis shows that there is a strong correlation between the National Development Index (NDI) and Supply Chain Management Index (SCMI). The analysis emphasises the need of enhancing the present supply chain network, quality of life and economic factors in order to improve the National economy.

J	Coombs, M; Lattimer, V				Coombs, Maureen; Lattimer, Val			Safety, effectiveness and costs of different models of organising care for critically ill patients: Literature review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES			English	Article						critical care; intensive care; workforce; cost effectiveness	INTENSIVE-CARE; SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS; UNIT; OUTCOMES; MORTALITY; COLLABORATION; MANAGEMENT; TISS; COMPLICATIONS; ASSOCIATION	New ways of working in critical care are emerging in response to increasing demands for care in the context of a limited critical care workforce. This review appraised the comparative safety, effectiveness and costs of new ways of working in critical care. All papers published in peer reviewed journals during 1990-2003 were utilised. A total of 933 potentially relevant papers were identified. Secondary sources including policy papers, and experts within the field were also used to inform this work. Initially 113 papers met the inclusion criteria. However, 58 of these described policy and secular trends in critical care and were therefore used only to provide background information. A total of 55 papers were then critically reviewed to provide academic focus on the subject area. Examples of comparative empirical research on new ways of working were limited, but the review revealed research activity in the areas of: impact of workload; nursing, medical and organisational factors affecting patient outcomes; and methods to support workforce calculations. The findings suggest that research into longer-term patient outcomes is needed together with a proactive and strategic interdisciplinary approach to practice, policy and research.

Design/methodology/approach - Additional to the conceptual development, survey method was applied in a single entity, through a structured questionnaire covering the management group of a multinational company. Findings - High potential to explain why some non-institutionalized cases happen and the importance to treat the strategic responses. Research limitations/implications - Model was applied only in one single entity. Futures researches may treat it in a more representative sample. Practical implications - The active approach required by the entity to involve and reinforce the institutionalization process. Originality/value - Integration of Tolbert and Zucker's approach with Oliver's and practical perspective of usage.

This study has two objectives: one is to discover the cyber-value chain coordinating mechanism which is one new mechanism other than market mechanism and firm mechanism; the other one is to construct the framework model of strategic cost management accounting of E-supply chain based on the new mechanism. More specifically, this paper develops three main methods of strategic cost management (including sharing information beyond one company boundary, the synergic management of the product design, and synergic utilization and management of intellectual assets), in order to improve the competitive capacity and to solve some current problems in the cost management beyond company boundary.

J	Fuller, D; Hanlan, J; Wilde, S				Fuller, Don; Hanlan, Janet; Wilde, Simon			The Identification and Implementation of Key Competitive Factors for Tourism Based Firms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						Destination decision process; business and strategic planning; service system; latent demand		The main aim of this conceptual paper is to propose means of extending current theoretical approaches to understanding the traveller destination decision process. In order to achieve this, a means of better identifying and implementing strategies within the service system, by utilising a strategic management approach, is proposed. In addition, a number of researchers have argued that service leaders successfully introduce products and services to the market far in advance of customer expectations. It is argued in this paper that such products and services are delivered by innovative organisations, able to assess that the benefits of such innovations will outweigh the costs. The firm attempts to tap "latent" demands that have yet to be fully articulated by the consumer through established expenditure patterns. By tapping into such demands within the consumer psyche, service firms are able to "delight" customers with their creativity and innovation. It is concluded that such a service component has become an integral source for sustainable competitive advantage within a business and strategic planning framework.

J	Hallin, CA; Marnburg, E				Hallin, Carina Antonia; Marnburg, Einar			In times of uncertainty in the hotel industry: Hotel directors' decision-making and coping strategies for dealing with uncertainty in change activities	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM			English	Article						change; uncertainty; decision-making; strategies; hotels	CHAOS	This paper is based on an exploratory case study of 12 hotel directors from Copenhagen, Denmark. The study investigates their perceived uncertainty in terms of decision-making during change processes with the aim of evaluating whether hotel directors take advantage of uncertainty to promote creativity and innovation in their change activities as a means of business development. It investigates which change activities hotel directors perceive as highly or less uncertain, and why and how they address uncertainties strategically. The findings of the study suggest that hotel directors do not benefit from uncertainty in order to develop competitive advantages. They employ traditional strategic approaches that apparently seem to reduce uncertainty by means of planning, sticking to procedures anti routines and postponing decisions until they feel sure about them.

Creating value from a commodity process: a case study of a call center	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Competences; Call centres; Case studies; Value added; United Kingdom	RESOURCE; KNOWLEDGE; CAPABILITIES; STRATEGIES; TAYLORISM	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize the unique value that can be created by performing a commodity process, in this case call handling at a call center, as a means of challenging the prevalent assumption that an organization should differentiate between the management of a core competence and a commodity process. Design/methodology/approach - An inductive case study is conducted to examine the strategic planning and management of a call center in one of the largest retailers headquartered in the UK. Semi-structured interviews, informal dialogue, on-site observation and documentation were the four data collection methods that we used. Findings - Based on the findings derived from the study, this study proposes the notion of a "differentiated commodity" to illustrate that a commodity process, such as handling customers' complaints and enquiries using standard call center technologies, can be significantly beneficial to the business, if differentiation was embedded into the architecture and management of the business process. Originality/value - The distinction between core competencies and commodity processes has become one of the key aspects in shaping a manager's decision making. The findings are vital not only in challenging such an assumption, but also in providing an explanation as to how strategic value can be generated by performing commodity processes, which is often under-estimated.

J	Hung, H; Wong, YH				Hung, Humphry; Wong, Y. H.			Organisational perception of customer satisfaction: Theories and evidence	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article							STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; IMPACT	Do managers in service organisations believe that the struggle matters more than the triumph? This paper proposes a model of organisational perception of customer satisfaction which posits that, given a lack of first-hand information on customer responses, organisations tend to adopt a process-based approach of evaluating the level of satisfaction of their customers. This evaluation process depends not on the assessment of actual outcomes such as sales revenue and customer complaints, but instead on the organisational efforts involved in satisfying the needs of customers.

J	Johnsen, RE				Johnsen, Rhona E.			The role of focal suppliers in strategic networks for internationalisation Perspectives from small and medium-sized Italian and Thai silk suppliers	JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Supplier relations; International business; Silk; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Italy; Thailand		Purpose - The purpose of this research paper is to examine the role of focal suppliers in strategic networks for internationalisation from the perspectives of small and medium-sized Italian and Thai silk suppliers. Design/methodology/approach - Multiple case studies of small and medium-sized suppliers within the silk industries of Italy and Thailand were undertaken. In total, seventeen interviews and three observations were conducted with directors or managers of silk suppliers and a range of government agencies, associations and institutes involved with the silk industry, to identify significant current issues within the sector. Conceptually clustered and role ordered matrices were used as coding frameworks to reduce, structure and analyse the data. Findings - Silk suppliers' networks may be co-ordinated by a focal supplier that assumes the role of strategic leader. The involvement of a focal and strategically-focused supplier may strengthen and integrate the resources and capabilities of silk suppliers in their networks and enable them to improve their international network development and positioning. Research limitations/implications - Further investigation is needed on the details of specific roles of focal suppliers in strategic networks. Practical implications - Silk suppliers, their customers and government agencies involved with silk suppliers should: advocate and actively support the development of focal suppliers in their networks to enhance the effectiveness of their internationalisation process and strategy. Originality/value - There tends to be a consensus in the literature about the influence of focal customers and larger organisations in strategic networks. This study highlights how small and medium-sized silk suppliers adopt the roles attributed to focal firms and gain positioning advantages for themselves and other suppliers in their network.

J	Kang, MS; Kim, BJ; Shin, JC				Kang, Myung Soo; Kim, Byoung Jai; Shin, Jong Chil			Measuring Consumer-Brand Relationship Quality	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE			Korean	Article						Customer-Brand Relationship; Customer-Brand Relationship Quality; Inter-dependence; Commitment; Love/Passion; Self-Connection; Intimacy; Brand Partner Quality		As a brand becomes a core asset in creating a corporation's value, brand marketing has become one of core strategies that corporations pursue. Recently, for customer relationship management, possession and consumption of goods were centered on brand for the management. Thus, management related to this matter was developed. The main reason of the increased interest on the relationship between the brand and the consumer is due to acquisition of individual consumers and development of relationship with those consumers. Along with the development of relationship, a corporation is able to establish long-term relationships. This has become a competitive advantage for the corporation. All of these processes became the strategic assets of corporations. The importance and the increase of interest of a brand have also become a big issue academically. Brand equity, brand extension, brand identity, brand relationship, and brand community are the results derived from the interest of a brand. More specifically, in marketing, the study of brands has been led to the study of factors related to building of powerful brands and the process of building the brand. Recently, studies concentrated primarily on the consumer-brand relationship. The reason is that brand loyalty can not explain the dynamic quality aspects of loyalty, the consumer-brand relationship building process, and especially interactions between the brands and the consumers. In the studies of consumer-brand relationship, a brand is not just limited to possession or consumption objectives, but rather conceptualized as partners. Most of the studies from the past concentrated on the results of qualitative analysis of consumer-brand relationship to show the depth and width of the performance of consumer-brand relationship. Studies in Korea have been the same. Recently, studies of consumer-brand relationship started to concentrate on quantitative analysis rather than qualitative analysis or even go further with quantitative analysis to show effecting factors of consumer-brand relationship. Studies of new quantitative approaches show the possibilities of using the results as a new concept of viewing consumer-brand relationship and possibilities of applying these new concepts on marketing. Studies of consumer-brand relationship with quantitative approach already exist, but none of them include sub-dimensions of consumer-brand relationship, which presents theoretical proofs for measurement. In other words, most studies add up or average out the sub-dimensions of consumer-brand relationship. However, to do these kind of studies, precondition of sub-dimensions being in identical constructs is necessary. Therefore, most of the studies from the past do not meet conditions of sub-dimensions being as one dimension construct. From this, we question the validity of past studies and their limits. The main purpose of this paper is to overcome the limits shown from the past studies by practical use of previous studies on sub-dimensions in a one-dimensional construct (Naver & Slater, 1990; Cronin & Taylor, 1992; Chang & Chen, 1998). In this study, two arbitrary groups were classified to evaluate reliability of the measurements and reliability analyses were pursued on each group. For convergent validity, correlations, Cronbach's, one-factor solution exploratory analysis were used. For discriminant validity correlation of consumer-brand relationship was compared with that of an involvement, which is a similar concept with consumer-based relationship. It also indicated dependent correlations by Cohen and Cohen (1975, p.35) and results showed that it was different constructs from 6 sub-dimensions of consumer-brand relationship. Through the results of studies mentioned above, we were able to finalize that sub-dimensions of consumer-brand relationship can viewed from one-dimensional constructs. This means that the one-dimensional construct of consumer-brand relationship can be viewed with reliability and validity. The result of this research is theoretically meaningful in that it assumes consumer-brand relationship in a one-dimensional construct and provides the basis of methodologies which are previously preformed. It is thought that this research also provides the possibility of new research on consumer-brand relationship in that it gives root to the fact that it is possible to manipulate one-dimensional constructs consisting of consumer-brand relationship. In the case of previous research on consumer-brand relationship, consumer-brand relationship is classified into several types on the basis of components consisting of consumer-brand relationship and a number of studies have been performed with priority given to the types. However, as we can possibly manipulate a one-dimensional construct through this research, it is expected that various studies which make the level or strength of consumer-brand relationship practical application of construct will be performed, and not research focused on separate types of consumer-brand relationship. Additionally, we have the theoretical basis of probability in which to manipulate the consumer-brand relationship with one-dimensional constructs. It is anticipated that studies using this construct, which is consumer-brand relationship, practical use of dependent variables, parameters, mediators, and so on, will be performed.

Assortative mixing in networks. Physical Review Letters 89, 208701], which is based on Pearson correlation coefficient. This study suggests that the measure based on Euclidean distances may be more appropriate for relatively smaller (N < 500) and denser networks. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Malovics, G; Racz, G; Kraus, S				Malovics, Gyorgy; Racz, Gabor; Kraus, Sascha			The role of environmental management systems in Hungary - Theoretical and empirical insights	JOURNAL OF EAST EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						environmentally conscious corporate management; EMS; strategy; competitiveness	PERFORMANCE; GREEN	Environmental and social aspects, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental Management Systems (EMS) play an increasingly important role in Western societies. Their role in the Hungarian business sphere has been growing continuously since the removal of the Socialist regime at the end of the 1980s. CSR and EMS are strengthened by two main factors: Hungary's EU accession and the German-oriented Hungarian economy. Recognizing this process, the aim of this paper is to give an insight to the reader regarding the present state of environmentally-conscious company management in Hungary, taking a strategic approach, on the basis of empirical research carried out at the end of 2004.

J	Morelli, J				Morelli, Jeff			Hybrid filing schemes: the use of metadata signposts in functional file plans	RECORDS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Plans; Functional differentiation; Archives management; Classification schemes		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to highlight the problems of using metadata to file electronic documents as well as the problems of using a purely functional filing scheme. It aims to explore how a functional file plan can be created from a business classification scheme by inserting "metadata signpost folders" at strategic points in the filing hierarchy to create a "hybrid functional file plan". Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on experience and published literature to discuss methods for creating a hybrid functional file plan. Findings - The paper concludes that functional filing is the only method of filing e-documents that can effectively support good information management practice, enabling all e-documents to be managed in line with corporate information management policies, and that it may also be the only viable method of providing true "shared" filing in support of knowledge management and business efficiency. Originality/value - The article shows that a functional filing scheme, retrieving, cross-referencing and grouping documents by subject (or other metadata attributes) requires special measures and suggests that current IT, EDRM and related technologies may not fully meet the requirements by searching/sorting on metadata terms. It may be necessary to compromise a purely functional file plan by the inclusion of metadata "signpost" folders into the functional folder structure in order to create a hybrid functional file plan.

J	Nielsen, Y; Erdogan, B				Nielsen, Yasemin; Erdogan, Bilge			Level of visualization support for project communication in the Turkish construction industry: A quality function deployment approach	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						visualization; construction; visual communication; quality	MANAGEMENT; DESIGN; SOFTWARE; SYSTEM	Quality of communication is a key factor in the success of construction projects. Visualization technologies can play an important role in improving the quality of data by improving human comprehension and increasing the depth of the information delivered. Visualization has for some time been identified as one of the major technology themes allowing development of construction processes. However, visualization has not been embraced as a strategic toot by construction companies, and they generally fail to take full advantage of available visualization tools. This paper aims to evaluate the extent of visualization as a communication tool in the construction industry and to determine potential benefits to be gained through implementation of visualization. The current state of the use of visualization for communication in Turkish architecture, engineering, and construction companies is mapped through surveys and interviews. Information flow contents and types are analysed to determine the types of information in the construction process that may benefit from visual representation. According to the priorities of the expectations ranked by the users and the potential of different visualization tools, the level of visualization required for each data flow is determined by a quality function deployment (QFD) based approach.

Governance contingencies for strategic technology alliances: a case in wireless business	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategic technology alliances; technology innovation; contingency model; wireless business	RESOURCE-BASED THEORY; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; SECTORAL DIFFERENCES; TRANSACTION COST; JOINT VENTURES; FIRM; VIEW; ORGANIZATIONS; BIOTECHNOLOGY; COLLABORATION	Strategic management research has often emphasised the importance of alliances as efficient structure to develop and commercialise technology-based innovation. The advantage of strategic alliances over the traditional hierarchical and market-like organisational forms has been evident in high-tech markets, featured by high degree of resource specificity and intense need for know-how transfer. Drawing from several theories, the paper proposes a novel contingency model to explain. how organisations decide on the governance structure of alliances by taking into account their strategic motivations and a number of contextual factors. The model is applied to a real-life case study in the wireless market to demonstrate its applicability.

J	Rich, S; Davis, L				Rich, Sarah; Davis, Loraine			Insights into the strategic ways in which two bilingual children in the early years seek to negotiate the competing demands on their identity in their home and school worlds	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARLY YEARS EDUCATION			English	Article								This paper reports on the results of a small-scale study into the ways in which two bilingual boys attempt to manage the discontinuities between their identities at home and as members of an early years class at a mainly white primary school in the UK. To do this, a number of semi-structured interviews were undertaken with the boys and their parents. The results reveal that while the children generally attempt to assume the pupil identity options afforded them at school, the differences between these and those they take up in their home environment generally lead them to seek to keep the world of the home and of the school separate in ways that disrupt the school's attempts to develop home/school partnership initiatives. We argue that a focus on identity management issues for children in the early years allows new and more critical understandings to emerge that can usefully inform the practices that educators can develop to enhance their learning experiences.

J	Nam, SM; Kim, JH; Noh, JK				Sang-Min, Nam; Kim, Jong -Ho; Noh, Jung-Koo			Sustainable Development and Sustainability Marketing - Integration of customer and socio-ecological aspect in Marketing concept	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE			English	Article						Marketing; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Sustainability Marketing		Since the 1992 UN Conference for Environment and Development held in Rio de Jaineiro, Sustainable Development has become the global thesis. More than 170 countries signed the Agenda 21 for the sustainable action plan, and adopted the sustainability concept as the key concept of dealing with the environmental, social, ethical, and economic problem. Sustainability is one of the main marketing challenges in the 21st century. By integrating social and ecological criteria, marketing may can make valuable contributions to sustainable development. Regarding the sustainability marketing, it is difficult to find the domestic marketing research on the thesis of sustainable development, and this is the definite evidence that the Korean marketing researchers do not realize the importance of the thesis of sustainable development which is internationally suggested as the new paradigm of change. The purpose of this study is to build the conceptual background and explore the research direction in order to introduce and adopt the concept of sustainable development in the domestic marketing research field. The present paper proposes a comprehensive conception of sustainability marketing, defined by six step: analysis of social-ecological problems; analysis of consumer behavior; normative sustainability marketing; strategic sustainability marketing; instrumental sustainability marketing; and transformative sustainability marketing. The aim of the paper are to clarify the concept of sustainability marketing. To accomplish this research purpose we discuss the sustainable development which is the conceptual background of sustainability marketing, analyze the characteristics of the sustainability marketing, and finally summarize the research results and present the suggestions for further research. Sustainability marketing embraces the idea of sustainable development, a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generation to meet their own needs. Sustainability Marketing goes beyond conventional marketing thinking. If marketing is about satisfying customer needs and building profitable relationships with customers, sustainability marketing may be defined as building and maintaining sustainable relationships with customers, the social environment and natural environment. By creating social and environmental value, sustainability marketing tries to deliver and increase customer value. Sustainability Marketing aims at creating customer value, social value and environmental value. Sustainability marketing integrates social and ecological criteria into the whole process of marketing, and can be differentiated in six steps: (1) Analysis of the social and ecological problems, generally and specifically with respect to products which satisfy customer needs and wants; (2) Analysis of customer behavior with special aspect to social and ecological concerns; (3) Corporate commitments to sustainable development in the mission statement, development of sustainability visions, formulation of sustainable principles and guideline, setting of socio-ecological marketing objectives and goals (normative aspects of sustainability marketing); (4) Sustainability segmentation, targeting and positioning, and timing of market entry (strategic aspects of sustainability marketing); (5) Integration of social and ecological criteria into the marketing-mix, i.e. products, services and brands, pricing, distribution and communication(instrumental aspects of sustainability marketing); (6) Participation in public and political change processes, which transform existing institutions towards sustainability (transformative aspects of sustainability marketing). The first two steps begin with an analysis of the company situation. In sustainability marketing it is crucial not just to know consumer needs and wants, but also to find out about the ecological and social problems of products along their whole life cycle. The intersection of socio-ecological problems and consumer wants sets the ground for sustainability marketing. Step three to five describe the implementation of sustainability marketing. Social and ecological criteria are fully integrated into the mission statement, strategies and marketing-mix. Step six is one of the specifics of sustainability marketing. It is about the commitment of company to sustainable development and their active participation in public and political processes in order to change the existing framework in favor of sustainability.

The undesired temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall, strategic situation of agricultural crops and complicated systems of water resources all are caused the application of mathematical models to be a necessity. On the other hand the stochastic property of inflow to the reservoir system makes the forecast of operation rules in reservoirs to have great importance for irrigation of farmlands. The aim of simulation technique is to predict a behavior of reservoir system in future operation periods. Decision makers make a good management for system operation by application of different scenarios. Savalan dam reservoir with 90 hm(3) active capacity was constructed to irrigate 1200 ha agricultural lands in Ardabil province. The monthly water demand of down stream agricultural lands assumed to be supplied perfectly. In this research to along dam reservoir operation forecast namely storage value, spill, evaporation and precipitation over reservoir lake the multi-layer feed forward back propagation ANN method used for simulation of reservoir inflow. The reservoir continuity equation was solved for both cases historical flow and simulated one for the purpose of reservoir parameters calculation parameters obtained from both cases of inflow were compared. The results showed the best consistency observed and calculated parameters.

J	Staniskis, JK; Stasiskiene, Z				Staniskis, Jurgis Kazimieras; Stasiskiene, Zaneta			An integrated approach to environmental education and research: A case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						curriculum development; environmental knowledge; awareness and actions; sustainable development; multidisciplinary research		Industrial processes have different levels of impact on the environment and there is a need to foster knowledge of the environmental consequences of industrial activities. One of the ways of achieving this is by the application of the concepts of industrial ecology (a multidisciplinary research approach) to industry's day-to-day activities. Another possible way of pursuing this goal is to use environmental education as a tool for increasing awareness with regard to the social, political and economic relevance of as well as the need for, environmentally sound industrial methods. Technical universities in the Baltic. Sea region, under the framework of the BALTECH consortium, have decided to develop and implement a new MSc Programme in Environmental Management and Cleaner Production, based on an integrated approach to industrial ecology towards current and long term/strategic environmental goals. The programme focuses on technologies and concepts in environmental planning and management for sustainable industrial development. The programme began at Kaunas University of Technology in September 2002. The Institute of Environmental Engineering (APINI), which is the main organisation responsible for the Environmental Management and Cleaner Production MSc programme in Kaunas University of Technology, treats the multidisciplinary approach as the main priority in the design of curricular models and views it as a strategic device in training graduates who will succeed in the labour market. This paper outlines a new educational model that provides students with both a systemic perspective and a more technical attitude for handling environmental multidimensionality.

The participating organizations were of two types: lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTO) social organizations and social service agencies not targeting LGBTO. These organizations were selected for participation because of their commitment to HIV/AIDS issues in API communities. An organizational survey and staff observations were used to explore changes in capacity. The organizations were mostly small, targeted diverse populations, served a large geographic area (southern California as a region), and were knowledgeable about HIV. Organizations became more viable (more capacity in human resources, financial, external relations, and strategic management), but also more unstable (large growth in paid staff and board members), and showed more capacity in HIV knowledge environments (especially less stigma and more sensitivity to diverse populations). The results suggest that capacity can expand over a short period of time, but as capacity increases, organizational viability/stability and HIV knowledge environments change, meaning that different types of technical assistance would be needed for sustainability.

Design/methodology/approach - The key issues of this case study are: the main organisational changes which have taken place over the last decades; the aspects of the organisational structure that have either contributed to or hindered competence-based management; the development of necessary researchers' competences related to main projects and processes and the way of appraising the development of their competences. The analysis of this paper was carried out considering the following phases: strategic planning, specifications of projects and processes, competence-based management and performance appraisal of researchers. Findings - Although integration was found between the performance measurement and strategic plans defined by the research centre, competence-based management is still centred on individuals and based on their tasks. The link between researchers' competences and their social context is not considered. Originality/value - Feedback from the results of research projects and recycling of organisational processes would allow the studied organisation not only to identify the individual competences necessary for each activity, but also to improve the relationship between professional growth and innovation brought about by competitive strategies of companies.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper follows a historical approach, first studying Spanish savings banks in general and the Caja de Ahorros de Navarra (CAN) in particular. It then examines the strategic challenges that the CAN faced in 2002 and the organizational response through the "You choose, you decide'' initiative. The implementation of the program is chronicled and results evaluated against strategic objectives. Findings - In embodying the social action program of the CAN, the "You choose, you decide'' campaign has successfully differentiated the bank. Customer-stakeholders have acquired a high degree of identification with the bank since they now decide on the beneficiaries of the social action program as well as their level of prioritization. Originality/value - This work is of special interest to bank managers who would like to incorporate CSR and increased stakeholder involvement into their strategic and differentiation objectives.

J	Wu, HL; Lin, BW; Chen, CJ				Wu, Hsueh-Liang; Lin, Bou-Wen; Chen, Chung-Jen			Examining governance-innovation relationship in the high-tech industries: monitoring, incentive and a fit with strategic posture	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						corporate governance; innovation; strategic posture; high-technology industries	FIRM PERFORMANCE; CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP; OWNERSHIP; RISK; AGENCY; BOARDS; MODEL; EXPERIENCE; DYNAMICS; IMPACT	Departing from the usual debates regarding the superiority of one governance structure over another, this study aims to complement the prior institutional approach by addressing how a firm's internal governance, via board competence and managerial incentives, shapes innovation performance. In a sample of 178 Taiwanese firms in the high-tech industries, the study sets out to examine the innovation-enhancing effects of the firm-level governance arrangements prescribed by agency theory. The results show that the effective governance, characterised by vigilant control through a competent board and the incentives of managers through equity ownership, are conducive to the desired and valued outcomes of innovation by aligning the risk differential between principals and agents. This universal relationship is further extended to a contingency perspective that innovation can be more significantly achieved by managerial risk readiness through a tight coupling of internal governance and the correspondingly appropriate strategy profile. The findings stress that governance and a clear posture of differentiation in high-tech environments are, arguably, multiple bases on which innovation is sought.

J	Yardley, I; Kakabadse, A				Yardley, Ivan; Kakabadse, Andrew			Understanding mission command: a model for developing competitive advantage in a business context	STRATEGIC CHANGE-BRIEFINGS IN ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE			English	Article								Academic and business journals have extensively covered the requirements for the successful implementation of business strategies without arriving at a consensus as to how this objective should be achieved. In Nutt's (2002) 20-year research on the decision-making process he found that over 50% of the decisions made by corporate leaders failed. The author contends that failed or poor decisions are directly linked to the way those decisions are implemented and therefore implementation methodology has become a critical business issue. This paper critically reviews the British Army's implementation methodology which has shown extensive versatility in such circumstances as the Gulf War, the firemen's strike, the foot and mouth crisis and a host of unexpected support operations. This work examines the British Army's definition of mission command, its historical background, the underpinning concepts and the potential utility of such an approach for the private sector. The authors argue that despite the British Army's training and terms of reference it has shown the flexibility and adaptability to achieve success in a volatile and diverse spectrum of tasks. At the heart of the organization's implementation process is mission command. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Strategic equilibrium versus global optimum for a pair of competing servers	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY			English	Article						queueing system; Nash equilibrium; linear reward scheme		Christ and Avi-Itzhak (2002) analyzed a queueing system with two competing servers who determine their service rates so as to optimize their individual utilities. The system is formulated as a two-person game; Christ and Avi-Itzhak proved the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium which is symmetric. In this paper, we explore globally optimal solutions. We prove that the unique Nash equilibrium is generally strictly inferior to a globally optimal solution and that optimal solutions are symmetric and require the servers to adopt service rates that are smaller than those occurring in equilibrium. Furthermore, given a symmetric globally optimal solution, we show how to impose linear penalties on the service rates so that the given optimal solution becomes a unique Nash equilibrium. When service rates are not observable, we show how the same effect is achieved by imposing linear penalties on a corresponding signal.

These new training perspectives are driven by the need for businesses to provide the right training quickly and efficiently and to support knowledge systems that are current, accessible, and interactive. This article will discuss strategic planning in terms of the organizational elements and the e-learning program requirements that are necessary to build a framework in order to institutionalize and sustain e-learning as a core business process. The elements of the organizational framework include leadership, change management strategies, the technology infrastructure, and the organizational structure. The e-learning program requirements include instructional systems, roles and competencies of key staff people, and budgeting. The building blocks in a framework to sustain e-learning and knowledge building start with a foundation laid out by the strategic plan.

It would be helpful to adapt a variety of multivariate statistical techniques to handle network-oriented data. A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) makes a particularly interesting example since it is the most general form of the general linear model. In an example involving 317 banks, a CCA is applied to two multiplex networks: interdependence and cooperative alliances. Four significant patterns of association (orthogonal linear functions) are identified. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Developing a web-based data mining application to impact community health improvement initiatives: The Virginia Atlas of community health	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE			English	Article						information technology; management training; public health		This article describes how a team from the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) and the Virginia Center for Healthy Communities (VCHC) attended the UNC Management Academy for Public Health to learn skills to address Virginia's commitment to using technology to improve the public's health. After creating a business plan for a food-safety information Web site, team members used that experience as well as Management Academy training in information technology, the management of data and finances, and strategic partnering to create a comprehensive tool with which to place customizable population data in the hands of anyone interested in pursuing population health improvement. The Virginia Atlas of Community Health, launched through the VCHC in 2003, places clear, compelling data in the hands of those who can influence decisions at the local level and create the most impact for health. Since the program's inception, more than 2,000 individuals have registered as ongoing users of the Virginia Atlas. Initially funded by a Turning Point grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the program is sustained through a series of smaller grants and funding from the VDH.

J	Onchaga, R				Onchaga, Richard			Quality of service management framework for dynamic chaining of geographic information services	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Annual Ph D Research Conference	OCT 27, 2004	Int Inst Geoinform Sci & Earth Observat, Enschede, NETHERLANDS		Int Inst Geoinform Sci & Earth Observat	geographic information services; service chaining; quality of service; geo-service infrastructure; quality model; QoS management framework		Dynamic chaining of geographic information services (geo-services) is gaining popularity as a new paradigm for evolving flexible geo-information systems and for providing on-demand access to geo-information. In dynamic chaining, disparate geo-services are discovered and composed at run time to yield more elaborate functionality and create value-added geo-information. Common approaches to service chaining discover and compose disparate geo-services based on the functional capability of individual geo-services. The primary concern of common approaches is thus the emergent behavior of the resulting composite geo-service. However, as geo-services become mundane and take on a greater and more strategic role in mission critical processes, deliverable quality of service (QoS) becomes an important concern. QoS concerns operational characteristics of a service that determine its utility in an application context. To address pertinent QoS requirements, a new approach to service chaining becomes necessary. In this paper we propose a QoS-aware chaining approach in which geo-services are discovered, composed and executed considering both functional and QoS requirements. We prescribe a QoS management framework that defines fundamental principles, concepts and mechanisms which can be applied to evolve an effective distributed computing platform for QoS-aware chaining of geo-services - the so-called geo-service infrastructure. The paper also defines an extensible QoS model for services delivered by dynamic compositions of geo-services. The process of orthophoto generation is used to demonstrate the applicability of the prescribed framework to service-oriented geographic information processing. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Carpano, C; Rahman, M; Roth, K; Michel, JG				Carpano, C; Rahman, M; Roth, K; Michel, JG			International competition in mature, localized industries: Evidence from the US furniture industry	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						strategic management; international competition; resource-based view	INERTIA; CAPABILITIES; CORPORATIONS; INVESTMENT; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE; COMPANIES; CAPACITY; BEHAVIOR; IMPORTS	This study explores the changes taking place in a mature localized industry, traditionally dominated by national players, when it faces the growing presence of international competition. The study is grounded in the resource-based view of the firm and integrated with prior work on international mobility barriers. Drawing on this work, several hypotheses are developed: (1) that resources associated with above average performance will change following the advent of foreign competition; (2) that domestic firms will inadequately transition to the newer valuable resources under a regime of increased foreign competition; and (3) following the entrance of foreign competitors, domestic firms' strategies will display higher levels of convergence. Empirical results, tested on a sample of firms from the U.S. furniture industry, are generally supportive of the hypotheses, although with some exceptions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

PisoSIA(R) (stakeholder identification and analysis) is an enhancement to the original method that helps in the identification of a system's stakeholders, analyses the impact they have on the system and also considers the effect of change upon those stakeholders. Overviews of the original and enhanced methods are provided and research investigations centred on four case studies are reported. Each of the case studies made use of the original PISO(R) method and two made use of the enhanced pisoSIA(R) method. These case studies demonstrate the worth of the enhanced approach. The stakeholder identification and subsequent analysis provides an effective complement to the original method and can clearly aid in change management within information system redesign.

J	Georg, D				Georg, Diana			Improving the oral health of older adults with dementia/cognitive impairment living in a residential aged care facility	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EVIDENCE-BASED HEALTHCARE			English	Article						aged care; dementia; implementation; oral health		Background Studies conducted in Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs) indicate that high levels of oral diseases and conditions are prevalent in older adults who have dementia. Poor oral health impacts on eating ability, weight, speech, hydration, severity of behavioural problems, appearance and social interactions. This study looked at a group of older adults with dementia in a RACF site in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia. It is known that in nursing home residents with dementia dental pain and problems are under-detected and under-treated. Strategy An audit was conducted to assess the level of compliance of the RACFs oral hygiene care practices with established best practice. The audit questions were based on current best practice as identified from a rigorous international systematic review of the subject. A clinical audit software program (The Joanna Briggs Institute, Practical Application of Clinical Evidence System (JBI PACES)) was used to manage the audit. An audit, feedback, re-audit cycle was followed. Stakeholders of the project were identified from which a Project team was formed. The Project team analysed the results of the first audit, conducted a situational analysis and formulated and implemented a strategic plan to target specific criteria for a change management process. Short-term and longer-term strategies were identified. Those criteria targeted as achievable in the short term were then re-audited after 6 weeks to determine the effectiveness of the change management process. Findings The criterion Daily cleaning and night-time removal of dentures are documented was re-audited and although there was a slight increase in compliance across the site this increase was not statistically significant. The criterion Resident's dentures are individually marked was re-audited and showed a large increase in compliance across the site, this increase was statistically significant.

J	Hall, R				Hall, Richard			Delivering What Students say They Want On-Line: Towards Academic Participation in the Enfranchisement of e-Learners?	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING			English	Article						Academic participation; Learner-enfranchisement; Teamwork; Sustainability		Sustainable e-Learning holds the promise of enabling higher education to meet the needs of a large and diverse market. Central to this is the response of academic staff teams in meeting the needs of individual learners, in order to enfranchise them within an evolving, enabling learning context. Enfranchisement is underpinned by the management of learner-expectations in the value-added nature of the on-line learning experience. However, learner-enfranchisement demands that on-line interaction is both accepted by academic teams and educationally liberating. Liberation requires meaningful existence, and hence active participation, within a 'supercomplex' world, in which both individual identities and the ability to manage information are tested. This paper assesses ways in which learner-enfranchisement can be encouraged by academic teams. It pivots around the outcomes from student evaluations of a strategic e-Learning implementation in one UK higher education institution. The conclusions that it draws focus upon strategies for adding pedagogic value, increasing academic participation and developing e-Learning sustainability in order to enfranchise e-learners. The argument highlights ways in which academic teams can move from a battery-intensive approach to e-Learning towards one that is more free-ranging. It highlights how academic staff can increase the sustainable, inclusive value of the learning experience at a minimised cost. From this basis, it is argued that any extant disenfranchisement in the delivery of e-Learning can begin to be addressed by increased team-work. A by-product for those teams is that in the very process of engaging their students, there is more hope that they will in-turn become empowered within their own use of e-Learning.

This study seeks to empirically examine the individual IT governance mechanisms that influence the overall effectiveness of IT governance. The data were obtained by using web based survey from 176 members of ISACA (Information Systems and Audit Control Association) Australia. This study examines the influences of six proposed IT governance mechanisms on the overall effectiveness of IT governance. Using Factor Analysis and Multiple Regression techniques, the current study finds significant positive relationships between the overall level of effective IT governance and the following four IT governance mechanisms: the existence of ethics/culture of compliance in IT, corporate communication systems, an IT strategy committee, and the involvement of senior management in IT					Ali, Syaiful/AAU-4531-2020	Ali, Syaiful/0000-0002-0563-4980			ARMSTRONG JS, 1977, J MARKETING RES, V14, P396, DOI 10.2307/3150783; BARLOW JF, 1990, J SYST MANAGE, V41, P6; Beyer JM, 1999, J MANAGE INQUIRY, V8, P287, DOI 10.1177/105649269983006; Broadbent M., 1998, LEADING GOVERNANCE B; Callahan J, 2004, STRATEGIES FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY GOVERNANCE, P343; Cerpa N, 1998, INFORM MANAGE, V34, P199, DOI 10.1016/S0378-7206(98)00060-3; COAKES SJ, 2003, SPSS ANAL ANGUISH VE; Cook T.D., 1979, QUASIEXPERIMENTATION; DeHaes S., 2005, P 38 HAW INT C SYST; Dehning B, 2003, MIS QUART, V27, P637; DOLL WJ, 1985, MIS QUART, V9, P17, DOI 10.2307/249271; EARL MJ, 1993, MIS QUART, V17, P1, DOI 10.2307/249507; Goodhue D.F., 1991, COMMUN ACM, V34, P63; Gorsuch RL., 1983, FACTOR ANAL; Gottschalk P, 1999, INFORM MANAGE, V36, P77, DOI 10.1016/S0378-7206(99)00008-7; Gujarati D.N., 1999, ESSENTIALS ECONOMETR; Haes S.D., 2004, INFORM SYSTEMS CONTR, V1; Hair J.F., 1998, MULTIVARIATE DATA AN, V5; Hall, 2003, ACCOUNTING AND FINAN, V43, P21, DOI [10.1111/1467-629X.00081, DOI 10.1111/1467-629X.00081]; Hardy G., 2003, INFORM SYSTEMS CONTR, V4; Hewson C., 2003, INTERNET RES METHODS; IT Governance Institute, 2003, IT GOV GLOB STAT REP; IT Governance Institute, 2003, BOARD BRIEF IT GOV, V2nd; JARVENPAA SL, 1991, MIS QUART, V15, P205, DOI 10.2307/249382; Jiang JJ, 1999, J MANAGE INFORM SYST, V16, P219, DOI 10.1080/07421222.1999.11518262; Karimi J, 2000, J MANAGE INFORM SYST, V17, P207, DOI 10.1080/07421222.2000.11045641; Kent R, 1999, J MARKET RES SOC, V41, P377; King W.

J	Baskerville, R				Baskerville, Richard			Hacker Wars: E-Collaboration by Vandals and Warriors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-COLLABORATION			English	Article						electronic collaboration; globalization of IS; hacker; IS risk management; IS security; security management; security risk		This article develops an analytical framework for new forms of information warfare that may threaten commercial and government computing systems by using e-collaboration in new ways. The framework covers (1) strategic model, (2) strategic arena, (3) e-collaboration, and (4) ethics and law. The framework then is used to compare two recorded instances of major hacker wars that erupted in the shadow of kinetic conflicts. In both cases, the hacker war appears to have been a grassroots collaborative enterprise by loosely organized civilians with neither government control nor permission. Collaborating across networks to coordinate their attacks, such hacker wars can attack both government and commercial computer networks without warning. The analysis shows how hacker wars demonstrate characteristics found in the frameworks and that there are forms of e-collaboration that represent a potentially difficult new source of threat for globalized information systems.

J	Dutrenit, G				Dutrenit, Gabriela			Instability of the technology strategy and building of the first strategic capabilities in a large Mexican firm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						learning; knowledge management; technological capabilities; strategic capabilities; technology strategy; latecomer firms	ACCUMULATION	The transition process from building a minimum knowledge base to deploying the first strategic capabilities is a neglected issue in the literature on technological accumulation in Latin American firms. This paper analyses three organisational processes that may affect this stage and discusses the role of an unstable firm's technology strategy in influencing such processes. Based on a detailed case study of Vitro S.A., one of the largest and most successful Mexican industrial groups, this paper argues that a context characterised by macroeconomic instability and distortions, and the lack of vision of the firm's top management about the role of technology in competitiveness, contribute to explaining the instability of the firm's technology strategy. This, in turn, is a major factor that negatively influences the conversion of individual into organisational learning, the coordination of different learning strategies, and the steadiness of the know ledge-creation process. The weaknesses in these processes make the deployment of strategic capabilities and the completion of the transition process more difficult.

A strategic decision support framework for integrated coastal zone management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategic planning; ICZM; spatial modelling; impact simulation; GIS; multicriteria analysis; decision-making		Given the apparent difficulties of making policy-relevant decisions in the context of the sustainable development of coastal zones, a tri-phasic framework is proposed, whose aim is to formalise the ICZM (integrated coastal zone management) decision-making process. This formalisation is meant to promote shared responsibility, accountability and transparency, hence the justifiability of actions. The decision support framework is called SSS (pronounced 'triple SSS') and integrates social research methods, scenario development, spatial impact simulation and the comparison of strategic alternatives.

Although it lacks the necessary characteristics to be regarded as a strategic resource, the internet seems to be a useful tool to provide support for competitive strategies. In this study, we discuss how the internet can be used to support the development of capabilities and redefine firm boundaries. Using a sample of Spanish manufacturing firms, we find positive relationships between the use of the internet and product differentiation based on innovation as well as the introduction of organisational changes. In addition, we present evidence that the internet modifies firm boundaries as a result of the positive relationships found between the use of the internet and the degree of vertical integration, as well as the establishment of technological agreements.

J	Gill, TJ				Gill, Tony			Workplace continuity: how risk and technology will affect facilities strategy	JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Business environment; Change management; Risk management; Knowledge economy; Real estate		Purpose - To provide a summary of factors contributing toward the movement toward decentralized workplaces; this will largely be driven by the need to principles of business continuity, as well as the increasing ubiquity of broadband. Design/methodology/approach - This takes a chronological approach to the development of a few previously separate organizational movements (i.e. business continuity, telework, advances in remote technology, facility strategy) and demonstrates how recent events have caused a collision of these factors. The result of this has been to energize the movement to alternative workplace models. Findings - The paper demonstrates how the concepts presented move from a theoretical construct to a practical one based on factors including reduced implementation costs, a greater need to protect human and physical capital, the need for organizations to remain competitive, as well as the need to address work and lifestyle balance needs of employees. Research limitations/implications - Enterprise-wide applications of business continuity are still relatively new, and the penetration levels of broadband are not quite at the point where change will occur immediately. Practical implications - Real estate professionals can effectively redefine their responsibilities and enhance their strategic profiles within the organizations they represent by understanding and integrating basic principles of workplace continuity. Originality/value - This provides a blueprint for planners considering fundamental changes in workplace configuration.

J	Kuhn, J				Kuhn, Joachim			Evolution of a worldwide production network	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Agile production; Automotive industry; Globalization; Production management		Purpose - The aim of this paper is the design of a strategic-operational decision support to justify a specific network configuration. Based on cost/earnings equations regarding quality, time and cost restrictions, the equations on the operational level get linked to the business strategy of globalisation. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is based on literature and empirical analysis reflecting internal and external benchmarking with other European-based car manufacturers. Thus, it combines theoretical aspects with practical evidence. Findings - The findings include a comparison of the traditional production strategy with an agile production. As shown for this industry sector, the future concentration of production will be with third party manufacturers (3PM) or in certain cases still with the OEM. Research limitations/implications - Further, research is embedded in comparing the agility approach with the different cultural elements like power distance or uncertainty avoidance, particularly for the automotive industry as one of the few globally favoured industry sectors. Another research field is addressed with the degree of customization: how much is really appreciated by the customer and therefore needs a flexible manufacturing approach? Practical implications - The practical implication lies in the decision support to design a global network of manufacturing locations. Moreover, the practitioner gets an insight for the limits of agility in the automotive sector. Originality/value - The value of this paper is given by bridging the scientific approach and practical constraints resulting in a state-of-the-art decision-making for network design in the automotive industry.

J	McNaughton, RB; Green, MB				McNaughton, Rod B.; Green, Milford B.			Inter-corporate ownership and diversification in the Canadian economy 1976-1995	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT HISTORY			English	Article						National economy; Diversity management; Canada; Corporate ownership		Purpose - To test the hypothesis of increased specialisation during the 1980s in the aggregate pattern of intercorporate ownership in the Canadian economy. Design/methodology/approach - The network of ownership between enterprises and subsidiaries is characterised for the period 1976-1995 using data for the population of medium-sized and large Canadian corporations collected by Statistics Canada. Findings - Aggregate diversification declined slightly over the period in terms of the average number of industry groups in which enterprises have subsidiaries. However, there was an increased likelihood that subsidiaries were outside of the core industry group of the enterprise. Research limitations/implications - The data provide insight into ownership changes across the economy and are not sensitive to changes in a few very large firms. However, a weakness of these data is that the ownership linkages are not weighted to reflect the economic importance of the enterprises involved. There is evidence that the pattern of inter- corporate ownership is different between manufacturing and service sectors. Future research should treat these separately. Practical implications - Increased specialisation to the core industry of an enterprise has implications for the management skills required to design and manage networks of independent firms (for example, through strategic alliances), the performance expectations and risks taken by shareholders, and the commercial and tax policies set by government. At an aggregate level, a reduction in diversification may change the industrial structure of the economy, with sectors less integrated through ownership relationships, and thus potentially more sensitive to patterns of market exchange. Originality/value - Much of the literature on the effect of ownership restructuring on aggregate diversification is focused on the US economy, and there is little empirical evidence in the Canadian context. The data are unique, representing a population of medium-sized and larger firms. To our knowledge there are no published analyses of the ownership structure represented in these data.

J	Paganelli, F; Pettenati, MC; Giuli, D				Paganelli, Federica; Pettenati, Maria; Giuli, Dino			A Metadata-Based Approach for Unstructured Document Management in Organizations	INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						design methodologies; document management systems; information system design; metadata; software development tools; Web-based applications		Effectively managing documents is a strategic requirement for every organization. Available document management systems (DMSs) often lack effective functions for automatic document management. One reason is that relevant information frequently is conveyed by unstructured documents, whose content cannot be easily accessed and processed by applications. This article proposes a metadata model, the DMSML (Document Management and Sharing Markup Language) to enable and to ease unstructured document management by supporting the design of DMSs. We argue that the extensive use of this metadata language will render organizational information explicit, promoting information reuse and interoperability in a more profitable way than what is guaranteed by proprietary DMSs. We also briefly depict the design and deployment phases of a Web-based DMS prototype based on DMSML. Our overall intent is to increase the awareness of what managers should account for when considering the possibility of adopting a DMS.

J	Peters, SR; Coles, AM				Peters, Stuart R.; Coles, Anne-Marie			Strategic innovation in sustainable technology: the case of fuel cells for vehicles	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						fuel cells; technology strategy; innovation; sustainability; commercialisation		This paper explores the gap between the implied theoretical 'assumption' that development of technologies for sustainable development should be a smooth evolutionary transition and the reality of such change. Here, we identify a split between macro, long-term models of transition to greater environmental sustainability through innovation, as found in theories of ecological modernisation, techno-economic paradigms and technology transitions and the firm level issues involved. Innovation theory, in contrast, has been concerned with contingent factors affecting the process of technology management and innovation strategy. While long-term models of change are predicated on the necessity of successful development and adoption of novel technologies, more specific, firm-based study of radical innovation demonstrates the complex and disruptive aspects of such change. In this paper, we investigate the interactions between these issues through a case study of fuel cell technology for vehicle propulsion.

The liberalisation and the unbundling of the institutional and market arrangements and the pervasive application of information and communication technologies have increased the interconnectivity among systems and nations, making risks to infrastructures more pressing and crucial for society. While infrastructural risks were traditionally managed by rather isolated monopolies and regulated by single governments, the present situation requires collective efforts by the concerned actors. The paper introduces the concept of governance, discusses the principles of "good governance" and evaluates its potential application to the handling of the risks of infrastructures.

SURVIVING IN CHAOTIC MODERN MARKETS: STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS IN TURBULENT TIMES	JOURNAL OF MARKETING THEORY AND PRACTICE			English	Article								Although the chaos theory has not been well publicized in American business literature, conditions that are creating chaotic shock waves are very real in both global and national markets. Marketing executives have to face these adversities and must learn to manage them. This will call for the creation of a counterchaos culture in the organization and development of a counterchaos marketing strategy that is proactive. Such a strategy goes beyond just survival. It transforms the conditions that are creating chaos into new market opportunities. Because conditions or occurrences that are creating chaotic shock waves in the marketplace are becoming more and more commonplace, it is extremely critical that firms develop a counterchaos strategy for survival and profit. This paper presents the conditions necessary to develop such a strategy. It also provides a research agenda that is needed for all firms.

Variation in soil properties on two partially revegetated saline scalds in south-eastern Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article							INLAND SLOPES; GRASSES; SITES	During 1999 and 2000, topsoil properties were sampled on a 3 by 3 m grid at 2 saline scalds on the inland slopes of New South Wales (NSW): Bocobra (0.11 ha) and Rugby (0.12 ha). Variability was examined in terms of range, standard deviation and coefficient of variation, maps with interpolated 'contours', and variograms. High variability was evident in all soil properties. pH(1:5 water) ranged from 4.8 to 8.0 at Bocobra and 5.9 to 9.0 at Rugby. Spatial 'highs' were evident at both sites but Rugby, which was mostly neutral, had both highs (alkalinity) and lows (acidity). Electrical conductivity (EC1:5 water) ranged from 0.5 to 6.6 dS/m at Bocobra and 0.1 to 2.6 dS/m at Rugby and was expressed spatially as highs across the sites. Concentrations of soluble ions were highly variable with both highs and lows evident. Concentrations of sodium and magnesium at Bocobra were highly correlated with EC1:5 water. Variability in EC and pH were high in comparison with published data from much larger areas of non-saline soils. An indication of temporal variability was obtained by carrying out an electromagnetic induction survey on 2 occasions. Despite changes in spatial patterns over time, EMh and EMV values were highly correlated at 1 site but not at the other. Variogram analysis suggested that changes in some variables, e. g. soluble potassium, changed markedly over distances less than 3 m. For most variables, the full range of variability occurred over distances of 8 - 10 m, though for some, e. g. soluble calcium, a distance of around 19 m was indicated. Variability cannot be ignored when planning revegetation projects or experiments. Partly because of their temporal variability, electromagnetic induction survey results (which were not calibrated with soil profile ECs in this study) may not provide useful guidelines for strategic soil sampling nor for locating experimental plots on scalded saline sites. Consideration should also be given to testing variables other than EC, e. g. pH and calcium, which may also limit plant growth on saline scalds.

J	Zoubir, YH; Ait-Hamadouche, L				Zoubir, Yahia H.; Ait-Hamadouche, Louisa			Anti-Americanism in North Africa: Could State Relations Overcome Popular Resentment?	JOURNAL OF NORTH AFRICAN STUDIES			English	Article								Anti-Americanism in North Africa is a complex phenomenon that can be analysed at two levels. The first level relates to the Maghribi governments' relationship - cooperative or hostile - with the United States. Traditionally, Tunisia and Morocco have maintained steady cooperation with the US, while for Algeria and Libya cooperation has only recently become a strategic choice. The second level relates to Maghribi public opinion. Although opinion polls and popular demonstrations often show a high degree of anti-Americanism, public opinion is not as homogeneous as it may appear. Indeed, there is a paradoxical twin movement of, on the one hand, real repulsion (animosity) towards the US government due to US policies, mainly toward the Arab and Muslim world, and, on the other hand, an obvious attraction for some American values and products, as well as for America's technological prowess. In order to avoid being alienated from their popular base, North African governments do their best to adjust their views to those of their public opinions. Hence, they criticise US policy towards the Palestinian issue or the Iraqi war, but at the same time cooperate fully with the US administration to obtain more direct investments for economic development, and for political support, in the name of security, to assure the survival of the regimes in place.

J	Thom, B				Thom, B			From alcoholism treatment to the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England: An overview of alcohol policy since 1950	AMERICAN JOURNAL ON ADDICTIONS			English	Article								With the publication of the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England in 2004,(1) it is timely to reflect on the social and political contexts that have influenced alcohol policy. This paper provides an over view of trends in the development of alcohol policy in England since 1950 with a focus on treatment policy. In particular, it traces factors that have prompted change and resulted in the "treatment" response of the 1960s becoming a small part of a larger, complex approach to the "management" of alcohol-related harm. The publication of the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England(1) and the Interim Analytical Report,(2) which provided the evidence and framework for the strategy, has resulted in fierce debate on the political processes underlying the emergence of the strategy, the extent to which the strategy is "evidence-based," its strategic aims, and the mechanisms for implementation. This paper argues that responses to policy statements-like the polities themselves-have to be examined within the political, economic, and cultural contexts of their time.

J	Mugisha, F; Birungi, H; Askew, I				Mugisha, F; Birungi, H; Askew, I			Are reproductive health NGOs in Uganda able to engage in the health SWAp?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						SWAp; decentralization; NGO; reproductive health; Uganda	SECTOR	This paper explores the ability for reproductive health (RH) non-governmental organizations (NGO) in Uganda to survive in the context of SWAp and decentralization. The authors argue that, contrary to the perceptions that this context may increase NGO's financial vulnerability, a SWAP and a decentralized system may provide an opportunity that should be embraced by NGOs to enhance their sustainability and effectiveness by reducing their current dependency on donor funding. The paper discusses the systemic weaknesses of many NGOs that currently make them vulnerable, and observes that unless these weaknesses are addressed, such NGOs will lose their space in the SWAP and decentralization arena. The authors suggest that NGOs need to recognize the opportunities that participating in public-private partnerships through a SWAP can offer them for long-term and significant funding. They need also to develop their capacity to pro-actively participate in a SWAP and decentralized context by becoming more entrepreneurial in nature, through re-orienting their organizational philosophies and strategic planning and budgeting so as to be able to partner effectively with the public sector in accessing funds made available through health sector reform.

J	Germain, L				Germain, L			Strategic noise in competitive markets for the sale of information	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION			English	Article						banks; contracts; fund management; market efficiency; noise	FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION; RENEGOTIATION; CREDIBILITY; CONTRACTS	This paper shows how informed financial intermediaries can reduce their trading competition by designing optimal incentive compatible contracts for the sale of information. With fund management contracts-indirect sale of information-banks can credibly commit to collaborate and add noise into prices. This is a way to circumvent the Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) paradox: when information is costly, by committing to add noise, the banks can recover the cost of collecting information and enter the market. By contrast, when information is costless, even with a large number of sellers of information entering the market prices are not fully informative. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Woodward, MR; Hennell, MA				Woodward, MR; Hennell, MA			Strategic benefits of software test management: a case study	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						software faults; software testing; functional testing; category partition approach; structural testing; test coverage measurement	EMPIRICAL-EVALUATION; INSPECTIONS	In some sections of the IT community, the principal form of software testing undertaken is functional testing, whereby, the functions that the software is supposed to perform are identified purely from the statement of requirements and these functions are then tested by means of representative test cases. It is argued in this case study that, whilst this provides a good foundation for testing, it can potentially leave many structural aspects of a program untested. What is advocated here is that test tools should be used to monitor structural coverage during functional testing and that additional test cases should then be devised to ensure that coverage is maximized. Although functional testing and structural testing might be seen as competitive techniques, in combination together they complement each other, forming a software testing strategy more powerful than either technique on its own.

J	Van Auken, S; Adams, AJ				Van Auken, Stuart; Adams, Arthur J.			Validating across-class brand anchoring theory: Issues and implications	JOURNAL OF BRAND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								One of the newest types of comparative advertising is across-class brand anchoring. Its intended purpose is to create a differential advantage for the sponsor's brand through the creation of a perception of good value. This study assesses the validity of this approach through a study of associational branding via alternative ad treatments. The results indicate that those ad-exposed respondents perceiving the brand to be of higher quality when contrasted to those perceiving it to be of lower quality show evidence of the effects of assimilation, or greater similarity between the referent brand and the exemplar brand, and an enhanced perception of good value. Overall, the findings suggest that across-class brand associations follow prescribed theory and warrant consideration as a strategic option in the creation of differential advantage.

J	Wiedmann, KP				Wiedmann, Klaus-Peter			Measuring brand equity for organising brand management in the energy sector-A research proposal and first empirical hints Part 2: Concept and results of an empirical study in the German energy market	JOURNAL OF BRAND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								In the first part of this contribution the idea of measuring brand equity via brand associations was presented and elaborated for companies in the energy sector to organise their brand management in a promising way. Additionally, a causal model of brand associations was developed which could support the goal of customer retention in the energy market. In this part of the contribution an empirical study will be presented to give some first empirical hints to prove the derived model, its hypotheses and conjectures. The study deals with commercial enterprise customers (CECs) in the German energy market, but will be supported by some results from a study in the market of private household customers (PHCs). The results indicate that it might be possible to escape from the price pressure which emerged in the course of the liberalisation of the energy market, but only if a differentiated brand association network is implemented. In the case of German local utility companies, such a brand association network could especially centre on an integrated approach of local importance branding. Although a lot of research still will be necessary to verify the concept, and also for its broadening and deepening, this paper clearly shows that brand equity oriented planning of strategic brand management might make sense not only in the energy sector, but also in general.

J	Bednall, DHB; Valos, MJ				Bednall, David H. B.; Valos, Michael J.			Marketing research performance and strategy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Market research; Performance management; Non-profit organizations; Australia		Purpose - To investigate whether strategic orientation affects the evaluation of specific market research projects in for-profit firms. Design/methodology/approach - A small-scale follow-up survey was conducted, building on qualitative and quantitative research among a sample of the top-1,000 marketing managers in Australia. The study used an existing market research evaluation tool, the USER scale and items generated from the qualitative research, to investigate the firm's most recent market research project. Findings - Four market research performance factors were identified - market research as a knowledge enhancing (KE) function, the internal political use of market research, the misuse of market research and the generation of market understanding. The Miles and Snow strategy types were related to these factors, with Prospector types more likely to use market research rationally and less likely to use it for internal political purposes. Tactical projects were more likely to be misused than were those with a strategic orientation. Prospectors were far less likely and Analyzers far more likely to misuse tactical research projects. Prospectors were more often satisfied with the performance of their most recent market research. The Porter typology was less successful in predicting market research performance. Research limitations/implications - The study was based on a small sample of market research projects in Australian for-profit firms. Future studies need to study these phenomena more intensively using ethnographic methods and more extensively using larger multi-country samples. Practical implications - Market research suppliers should learn the nature of their client's strategic intent to improve their effectiveness. Defender firms should carefully monitor the use of market research, especially that of a tactical nature, which may be wasted or misused. Originality/value - The paper contributes to an understanding of how strategic orientation relates to the ways market research information is used within the firm.	[Bednall, David H.

J	Dansky, KH				Dansky, KH			Marketing telehealth to align with strategy	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Telehealth is a twenty-first century solution to an old problem-how to deliver quality health services with shrinking resources. Telehealth enables healthcare providers to interact with and monitor patients remotely, thus adding value to service delivery models. On occasion, telehealth can substitute for live encounters, saving time and resources. Furthermore, as the geriatric population increases, telehealth will support independent living by supplementing the existing network of care. To be used most effectively, however, telehealth services must be carefully planned and executed. This study investigated management practices used to promote telehealth services, focusing on strategic goals for adopting telehealth. Interviews with senior managers from 19 home health agencies identified three strategic goals for adopting telehealth: (1) clinical excellence, (2) technological preeminence, and (3) cost containment. Organizational documents were analyzed to determine the extent to which the telehealth program was featured in marketing materials. Documents included the organization's brochure, newspaper ads and articles, and each home health agency's web site. Results showed that marketing practices vary widely but are correlated with motivations to adopt telehealth. The organizations with the highest marketing scores emphasize clinical excellence as a major reason for using telehealth, whereas those with the lowest marketing scores tend to focus on cost containment. Although this study focused on management practices in home health agencies, results are applicable to hospital and outpatient services as well as to other community-based programs. Using a strategic management framework, the authors offer recommendations to help organizations develop effective marketing approaches for telehealth programs.

J	Eng, TY				Eng, Teck-Yong			Conceptualization of Strategy in Business Networks: An Assessment	JOURNAL OF MARKETING CHANNELS			English	Article						Network approach; strategy; network context; learning; interdependencies		This conceptual article explores the ways in which strategy is being conceived in business networks. The dominant industrial organization-based approach to strategy development has been noted to be inadequate in networks where strategies are characterized by joint action and interdependencies between firms. While the Europe-based network approach offers insights into network competition, it presents a rather broad concept that includes almost any kind of strategic action. The main obstacles are associated with the conceptualization of network context as borderless entities, and the absence of a dynamic integration between causal mechanism of business relationships and network context. It is suggested that an analysis of the concept of learning with respect to four levels of network context: industries as networks, firms in network, relationship portfolios and exchange relationships could provide a fruitful theoretical explanation for strategy in networks.

J	Gornick, ME; Blair, BR				Gornick, Mary Ellen; Blair, Brenda R.			Employee Assistance, Work-Life Effectiveness, and Health and Productivity: A Conceptual Framework for Integration	JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH			English	Article						Work-life initiatives; health and productivity management; EAP; work-life wellness integration; workplace flexibility; worker resilience; interconnectedness		As context for the following collection of articles, this article provides a conceptual framework regarding integration of employee assistance, work-life and health and productivity management initiatives. The discussion begins with a description of five societal trends in medicine, business, social work, globalization, and ecology that lead to ideas of connectedness, interdependence, a systems approach, and the reciprocal interaction between the individual and the whole. An examination of how these societal trends have influenced the current approaches to human resources management and occupational health show that these departments have become strategic, preventive, and population focused. This new thinking has stimulated awareness of the commonalities of employee assistance, work-life, and health and productivity management initiatives. Brief descriptions of the history and evolution of each distinct field are set forth, followed by an identification of commonality in purpose and service delivery. The article concludes with the suggestion that integration of service delivery makes sense and offers recommendations for how organizations can approach the integration of existing services.

J	Keller, JW; Keller, C				Keller, Jennifer W.; Keller, Chris			Bringing strategic efficacy to facility management through CAFM tools	JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						CAFM; standards; data integration; data transfer; data validation; electronic project management; interoperability; electronic CAD archives; company churn		Most larger companies and corporations who own or lease multiple locations face challenges in designing, tracking and managing property. The following case study examines the work of the Facilities Design and Planning Group at Dow Jones & Co. The study follows the group's efforts to improve the strategic efficacy of its operations by expanding its implementation of its computer-aided facility management (CAFM) system and by developing some novel CAFM tools. These technologies are intended to reduce management costs by creating a central and comprehensive resource of facilities information. Both facilities professionals and those seeking facilities-related information can then use this resource. These tools support day to day facilities operations, from master planning to project design and budgeting, from construction to lease management. Such technology increases accuracy through data validation, but remains flexible in reporting and inquiry. This paper documents both the evolution of these tools, and the decisions that guided their development. It aims to describe in detail the particular business circumstances that influenced Dow Jones' efforts as well as expose the setbacks in using and expanding various aspects of the technology.

J	Kilfoil, WR; Groenewald, T				Kilfoil, Wendy R.; Groenewald, Thomas			MERGERS AND CHANGE MANAGEMENT AT THE MICRO LEVEL: A CASE STUDY	SA JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The transformation of the South African higher education landscape resulted in, among other things, the merger of three distance education institutions: Unisa, VUDEC and TSA. The macro level of the merger will no doubt be studied in detail. This article explores a micro level process for two departments merged by a top-down decision that did not take cognisance of their dissimilar functions and structures. The result was both a merger and a demerging process. The two departments first had to confront the realities of their different functions and structures before a reconfiguration could occur, including the emergence of a strategic plan focusing on aspects such as specific contribution, drivers, objectives and structure. The change management principles adopted to ensure the success of the process are outlined, analysed and reflected upon.

J	Laughton, D				Laughton, David			The Development of International Business as an Academic Discipline: Some Implications for Teachers and Students	JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS			English	Article						International business; academic discipline; curriculum; research; pedagogy		This article reviews the emergence of international business (IB) as an academic discipline through an examination of IB research, curriculum, and location within the organisational structures of universities and business schools. A selective review of the literature on IB education is used to identify different approaches to the formulation of the IB curriculum and its constituent parts and principal features: internationalisation of business functions; integration of constituent subject areas; multidisciplinary and strategic orientation. This is used to derive a number of pedagogic implications for both teachers and students of IB: sequencing and ordering of the curriculum; revealing the ontology and epistemology of IB; breadth versus depth in the curriculum; emphasising a study of or for IB; locating and structuring IB within a modular programme; class room practice for delivering the IB curriculum.

J	McKay, RB; Chung, E				McKay, Ruth B.; Chung, Ed			Benchmarking for entrepreneurial survival Pursuing a cohesive and imperfectly imitable culture	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Benchmarking; Entrepreneurialism; Organizations; Business development	ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; PEOPLE	Purpose -To propose a conceptual framework that facilitates the benchmarking of strategic processes necessary for entrepreneurial survival and success. Design/methodology/approach -Drawing on extant literature on entrepreneurial survival, this paper considers the chaotic and emergent nature of the entrepreneurial organization and how benchmarking can contribute to a newly established firm's chances for survival and prosperity. The paper incorporates the concept of a sustainable competitive advantage in the discussion, and offers organizational culture as being the imperfectly imitable element which will contribute to the entrepreneurial firm's success. Findings -Four key processes are identified that contribute to entrepreneurial viability cooperation, sharing founder's vision, time management, and developing organizational competencies -and suggestions are offered for developing appropriate benchmarks for these processes. The paper also highlights two instruments that may be useful in this endeavor. Research limitations/implications -The paper draws attention to the usefulness of benchmarking processes and not just metrics in fostering entrepreneurial survival. Key processes are identified, and suggestions are provided for researchers to begin work on developing the necessary benchmarks. Practical implications -The paper not only offers a theoretical discussion of the usefulness of benchmarking processes as opposed to focusing only on outcomes, but also helps the practitioner to implement such benchmarking activities by highlighting practical instruments for this purpose. Originality/value -This paper brings to bear literature from several streams of research. It takes benchmarking from its metric-oriented focus to a more process-focused approach, and applies it in the context of entrepreneurial survival.

J	Meekings, A				Meekings, Alan			Effective review meetings: the counter-intuitive key to successful performance measurement	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance measurement (quality); Case studies		Purpose - To present clear pointers to best practice in the implementation and use of performance measurement, highlighting the significance of effective review meetings, connected across functions and between levels in organisations. Design/methodology/approach - A summary of practical experience in the implementation and use of performance measurement, supported by three complementary case studies, each illustrating ways in which it can be both a catalyst and impetus for results otherwise unachievable. In particular, this paper explains why the greatest benefits lie not in specific measures themselves, nor even in the process used to develop them, but in how performance measurement is actually implemented and used in practice. It argues that the key to getting the most out of performance measurement is to grab the review process and make it work properly. Findings - Insights into how to maximise the value of performance measurement by making the review process work properly, such that strategic developments and continual improvement are effectively "pulled-through" in a coherent and progressive fashion and the measures themselves become essentially "self-correcting". Originality/value - This paper brings performance measurement to life, by concentrating on how it is best implemented and used in practice through focusing on what it takes to make the review process work properly from top to bottom and side to side across organisations. It also offers some interesting hypotheses for further academic work in this field.

J	Packham, G; Brooksbank, D; Miller, C; Thomas, B				Packham, Gary; Brooksbank, David; Miller, Christopher; Thomas, Brychan			Climbing the mountain: management practice adoption in growth oriented firms in Wales	JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Management development; Business development; Small enterprises; Small to medium-sized enterprises; United Kingdom		Purpose - This paper proposes that owner-managers of growth firms are more likely to have developed or acquired managerial practices that facilitate such expansion. The paper, therefore, examines how growth oriented firms in Wales have adopted management practices to build the necessary entrepreneurial capacity to sustain growth. Design/methodology/approach - A group interview technique was utilised to examine the management development process in 18 growing firms across the manufacturing, construction sectors. Findings - The research highlighted that whilst firms argued that the management practices they had implemented were to facilitate further growth, the relative importance of practices such as marketing, financial management and planning varied across sectors. Furthermore, it was apparent that growth firms identified in this study were more inclined to look at the adoption of management practices from a strategic perspective. Research limitations/implications - The exploratory nature of this study means that it is difficult to generalise these findings outside the boundaries of the adopted research strategy. In addition, links between performance and managerial action are always very difficult to demonstrate conclusively as this process is often dependent on owner-managers recounting and recognising cause and effect relationships. Nevertheless, the study does strengthen existing academic argument that key management practices outlined in this paper are regularly adopted by growing firms. Practical implications - The findings will assist policy makers and owner/managers with regard to identifying and understanding why certain management practices engender small business growth. Originality/value - The paper adds its support to the growing literature which examines the process of management development in small growth firms. Moreover, given Wales' current dearth of growth oriented firms, the paper implies that policy makers should support training and initiatives that develop entrepreneurial and managerial competencies that are industry specific.

J	Schulze, B; Thielmann, B; Sieprath, S; Hess, T				Schulze, Bernd; Thielmann, Bodo; Sieprath, Stephan; Hess, Thomas			The Bertelsmann AG: An Exploratory Case Study on Synergy Management in a Globally Acting Media Organization	JMM-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON MEDIA MANAGEMENT			English	Article								By the multiple usage of immaterial resources across organizational and national market borders, globally acting media conglomerates are able to achieve outstanding synergies. For this reason, they are expected to realize higher margins of profit than smaller-size, nondiversified media firms. However, no empirical evidence has been found for a positive correlation between a firm's size or its presence in many businesses of the media industry and its economic performance until now. Consequently, possible synergies do not seem to be fully exploited in many cases. This article analyzes how to institutionalize and implement synergy management in decentralized media organizations. For these purposes, we first develop a basic understanding and then conduct an exploratory case study on Bertelsmann's approach, which overcomes the stress ratio between corporate coordination and independent action at the operational level. Distinguishing various product types and triggers, this case study renders the process of synergy management more precisely and illustrates how to arrange responsibilities between organizational units. Finally, by relating the results of the case study to the body of literature, we work out patterns of responsibility assignment and drivers of success for strategic integration. In contrast to operational integration, the latter may lead to synergies due to cross-divisional cooperation and business development.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP, INNOVATION AND MARKETING: CONCEPTUALIZATION OF CRITICAL LINKAGES	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MANAGEMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						Entrepreneurship; Innovation; Strategy; Marketing		The objective of this article is to develop a conceptual analysis of entrepreneurship, innovation, and strategic marketing, and examine their critical linkages with each other for the success of an organization. Understanding of each of these areas and their linkages is important as they collectively provide value to the customer. We first discuss the concept of innovation. its sources and its types such as radical and incremental innovations. The entrepreneurial, technological and strategic concepts behind the central aspect of the innovation concept are then discussed to provide the relevant theoretical background. The ensuing discussion of entrepreneurship and its challenges in the context of dot-corn phenomenon helps us examine the critical linkage between innovation and entrepreneurship. We then discuss the marketing concept, its evolution and practices. Finally, a strategic marketing process framework has been proposed as a normative rocuimap to be followed by entrepreneurs and managers for successful marketing practice.

Construction of Plan Environmental Impact Assessment System in China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						China; EIALPRC; PEIA; Plan; SEA; System		Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is a frontier subject in the field of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which means the environmental assessment process for strategic actions: policies, plans or programs (PPPs). At present, Plan Environmental Impact Assessment (PEIA), the plan level of SEA, is legally required in China and the government has published a recommended technical guideline for it. This paper introduces the progress of PEIA in China and summarizes three developing phases and introduces their characteristics. According to Environmental Impact Assessment Law of the People's Republic of China (EIALPRC), the article describes the current PEIA system in China, mainly focusing on assessor, assessment targets, assessment requirements, assessment contents, assessment methods and working procedure of PEIA etc. Finally, some recommendations are proposed by the authors in order to improve PEIA in China as follows: conforming to the principle of "intervening in early stage", achieving synchronous EIA of all plans: implementing classification management on PEIA according to the degree of environmental impacts of plans; and enhancing efficiency of alternative schemes in the process of planning.

J	Kodama, M				Kodama, M			Business innovation through strategic community creation: a case study of multimedia business field in Japan	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						innovation; community; leadership; ICT; multimedia		For the last few years, the video conferencing system market represented by multimedia technology has enjoyed strong growth in Japan. Behind the recent upturn in this market was the strategic alliance of NTT, Japan's largest telecommunications carrier, and PictureTel of the US, followed by the birth of business communities centered around or outside NTT, thus intensively creating and boosting a new market referred to as interactive video communication. This case study reviews the challenges that faced NTT, one of the big businesses in Japan, followed by PictureTel and other players within and outside NTT, all of which were lined up to create various strategic business communities. The article gives careful consideration to the measures taken by these players who achieved success in such a way as to alter employee consciousness, vitalize organizational morale, entrench the new NTT "Phoenix" brand (video conferencing system) in the Japanese market, and create an emergent new video conferencing market.

J	Annacker, D; Hildebrandt, L				Annacker, D; Hildebrandt, L			Unobservable effects in structural models of business performance	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						success factors; unobservable variables; structural equation modeling; product quality	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; MARKET SHARE; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; PRODUCT QUALITY; VARIABLES; FIRM; PERSPECTIVE; INSTRUMENTS; ENVIRONMENT	Critiques of the concept of key success factors have raised objections both conceptually and methodologically. From the latter perspective, common research practice is criticized for neglecting the influence of firm-specific, unobservable variables (e.g., management skills). To control for these effects, a structural equation approach ("LISREL") to the analysis of panel data is proposed. In an empirical study based on the PIMS annual database, the influence of unobservables on the direct and indirect effects of product quality on profitability is examined. It is shown, how a step-by-step extension of a basic simultaneous equation model sheds some light on the role unobservable variables play. Even after controlling for persistent unobservable effects, product quality and market share remain significant determinants of profitability. (C) 2002 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	McGowan, JJ; Overhage, JM; Barnes, M; McDonald, CJ				McGowan, JJ; Overhage, JM; Barnes, M; McDonald, CJ			Indianapolis I3: the third generation Integrated Advanced Information Management Systems	JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION			English	Article							MEDICAL-CENTER; OF-MEDICINE; IAIMS; LIBRARY	In 2001, the Regenstrief Institute for Health Care and the Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) began an IAIMS planning effort to create a vision and a tactical plan for the first Integrated Advanced Information Management Systems (IAIMS) implementation to cross a large area and include unaffiliated institutions. A number of elements made this planning effort unique. Among these elements were the existence of a network infrastructure that supported the Indianapolis Network for Patient Care, the existence of a mature medical informatics program at the Regenstrief Institute, and the existence of a wide-area knowledge network fostered by the IUSM libraries. However, the leadership for a strong information technology role in the IUSM that could promote collaboration in support of education and research across the diverse Indianapolis hospital systems had been lacking. By bringing together various groups, each with a commitment to improve health care quality and public health across the Indianapolis metropolitan area, regardless of individual institutional affiliation, the strategic directions for I3-Indianapolis IAIMS Initiative have been defined and the foundations for a third generation IAIMS construct have been laid in Indianapolis, Indiana.

J	Bidault, F				Bidault, F			Global licensing strategies and technology pricing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Most manufacturing firms today realise that licensing is a powerful means to achieve their strategic goals. As an increasing number of industries experience globalisation, large as well as small firms are contemplating licensing in their wish to reach new markets or to reduce manufacturing costs. Among the numerous questions raised by licensing in the different fields of management, the technology pricing issue figures prominently. Previous research on technology pricing has essentially focused on the possible existence of economic drivers, however, the strategic dimension of licensing has been neglected. A better understanding of the pricing policy of firms implies taking their licensing rationales into consideration. This is what we intend to do in the present paper. After reviewing the literature that provides a framework for most research on technology pricing, we will present an analysis of the licensing motives leading to the identification of three generic licensing strategies and to the formulation of some hypotheses. It will be seen that our approach is not contradictory to previous ones, particularly Contractor's, but rather builds on them by identifying the conditions under which they are valid.

J	Marcella, R; Knox, K				Marcella, R; Knox, K			Systems for the management of information in a university context: an investigation of user need	INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL			English	Article							STRATEGIES	The accessibility, reliability, consistency, and relevance of data underpinning information systems are crucial to its use and effectiveness in a university setting. This article reports on the findings of a research project carried out at a new university, which highlighted the role information plays in the success of the operation and in allowing the institution to evolve and meet the challenges posed by the government, students and other stakeholders. Data were gathered from the academic and administrative staff of the university through interviews with senior managers, and a Web-based questionnaire completed by 863 respondents ( a 47.9% response rate). The project aimed to explore data and information activities supporting management and strategic decision making in a new university. Project results indicate that there are real deficiencies in the realization of the case institution's information strategy and that these deficiencies must be addressed in developments focusing on improving strategic effectiveness in the future. Particular issues identified included the lack of clarity in responsibility regarding information and concerns about the validity of much of the internally created and maintained data.

Some time in the next two decades we will enter our fourth industrial era, fueled by evolution in power, genetics, space exploration and information technologies. Unlike other industrial revolutions, this will be attended by widespread consolidations in industries as diverse as utility, retail, pharmaceuticals as well as the government. The trade wing of the UN, the United Nations Trade Organization (UNTO) is established to deal with global issues. The UNTO passes a number of resolutions including # 1/10 which deals with a uniform system of personal identification for all individuals. Due to free trade facilitated by electronic bureaucracies and global transportation grids, GNP growth rates triple. However, the consolidations will lead to the disappearance of clerical, administrative and management employees, leaving only the top management and highly skilled professionals. These changes will result in companies outsourcing all their routine processing to transaction and data centres. Employees will work from well equipped IT centres. The internet is in its third incarnation and is supported by a comprehensive web intelligence to answer all possible questions. Other technological changes include Terahertz computers, Personal identification Devices (PID), AI chips and hierarchical databases with relational interfaces. The cornucopia resulting from progress will lead to a more enlightened society. However, the stress of change will result in an increased degree of philosophical inquiry. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Emergency rescue systems (EMS) based in fire departments initially demonstrated encouraging outcomes as new strategies were developed in communities led by people committed to such programs, but the overall impact on survival has been modest. With improvement in automated external defibrillator (AED) technology in recent years, there has been increasing interest in their use by non-conventional responders in recent years. In parallel with the AED strategies, adjunctive strategies and therapies have been developed. These include the demonstration that interventions targeted to reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium, such as thrombolytic therapy given by EMS responders, clarification of the role of intravenous amiodarone for electrophysiologically-resistant cardiac arrest victims, and demonstration of a role for hypothermia in post-cardiac arrest. Thus, the range of pre-hospital and in-hospital strategies for improving cardiac arrest survival continues to broaden. The major lesson learned during the past two decades is that no single strategy can be relied upon to yield a major impact on the mortality from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The cumulative effect of multiple strategies, working together toward the same goal, will ultimately provide additive effects on outcomes. Carefully thought out strategic approaches can maximize the effect on total mortality.

J	Morgan, PM				Morgan, PM			NATO and European security: The creative use of an international organization	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES			English	Article							FUTURE	This essay deals with Europe's experience in regional security building. In the author's view, it is hard to find much comfort for the Middle East in the modern history of security management in Europe. Certain basic elements which made the process work in Europe are lacking in the Middle East. Morgan discusses at length NATO's role in and contribution to the emergence of a pluralistic security community in Western Europe. It did so by developing a level of advanced multilateralism verging on integration, and by supplying the framework through which the powerful military capabilities of states with long histories of past conflicts and rivalries could coexist without provoking traditional fears and insecurities.

J	Pini, B; Brown, K; Simpson, L				Pini, B; Brown, K; Simpson, L			Evaluating 'Australian women in agriculture': 1992-2002	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION			English	Article							NEW-ZEALAND; REPRESENTATION; WALES	Australian Women in Agriculture (AWiA) will be 10 years old this year. This paper draws on 20 interviews with members of AWiA to describe the changing nature of the group over this period and to examine its achievements and future in terms of its five stated goals. The group has been most successful in achieving its first aim: raising the profile of women in agriculture. AWiA has achieved its second aim: securing local, regional and international recognition; and its third aim: of being seen as a political force. There is, however, still much for the group to achieve in meeting its final two goals: addressing rural and agricultural inequities and ensuring the survival of agriculture for future generations. The AWiA, having achieved status and recognition, is now in a strategic position to address these goals. How it may do this and not unsettle the members' shared identity as 'women in agriculture' to the point where the future of the group is threatened is the challenge for AWiA as it begins its second decade.

J	Gunnarsson, C; Jonsson, S				Gunnarsson, C; Jonsson, S			Charge the relationships and gain loyalty effects: Turning the supply link alert to IT opportunities	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	NOFOMA 2001 Conference	JUN 14-15, 2001	REYKJAVIK, ICELAND	NOFOMA		supply chain management; integrative logistics operations; IT; loyalty; relationship		The main purpose of this paper is to explore and analyze interconnected effects related to the use of IT, and in so doing, provide an understanding of integrative logistics operations in a supply chain link. We take a theoretical point of departure in the three factors of relationship investments, formalization and trust. Thereafter we will expand and elaborate these factors by discussing embedded elements and mechanisms, related to relationships and loyalty, which result in an outlined model for empirical research focused on operational and strategic partnerships. Based on an empirical analysis we propose that the use of IT, expressed as digitization, can be seen as a driving force for bridging a gap between the actual and potential pattern of integrative logistics operations in a supply chain link. Digitization activates mechanisms in trust, commitment, and solidarity, which are related to loyalty and simultaneously enable heterogeneous influences in relationship characteristics.

J	Carlson, KD; Connerley, ML				Carlson, KD; Connerley, ML			The staffing cycles framework: Viewing staffing as a system of decision events	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article							JOB CHOICE DECISIONS; APPLICANT ATTRACTION; PERSONNEL-SELECTION; UTILITY ANALYSIS; EMPLOYEE TURNOVER; SELF-SELECTION; IMAGE THEORY; PERFORMANCE; PREFERENCES; MODEL	We propose an alternative staffing framework that adopts a systems view of staffing and articulates the internal structures and influence mechanisms that determine "how" staffing outcomes occur The staffing cycles framework (SCF) portrays the interrelationships among the actors, contexts, and activities of staffing as staffing cycles composed of decision events. A staffing cycle is a sequence of seven decision events controlled alternately-not mutually-by individuals and organizational decision makers. Staffing cycles are the smallest unit of analysis that still retains all staffing components and frames how and when staffing outcomes are affected. Decision events capture the primary decision activities of staffing systems. All decision events share a common structure that depicts how actors, contexts, and activities are combined to influence staffing outcomes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Kivaria, FM; Kapaga, AM				Kivaria, FM; Kapaga, AM			Review of current problems and shortcomings in the Tanzanian animal health information system with suggestions on improvement	ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH			English	Article						geographical information system; information system; sampling techniques; surveillance; Tanzania		Livestock diseases have always been the focus of the Tanzanian Veterinary Authorities. However, they have become more important since the formation of the World Trade Organisation and subsequent implementation of the various multilateral agreements on trade. There is also a strong political desire to improve the animal health status as part of poverty alleviation strategies. As a result there is a need to develop better systems for investigating and reporting of animal diseases. In order to follow the OIE pathway and to obtain a disease free status, reliable evidence of freedom from particular diseases is becoming an issue of major interest. Assessment of the Tanzanian animal health information system revealed two major problems; firstly, the absence of disease information that accurately reflects the health status of the source population, and secondly, an inefficient information management system which is unable to provide useful information on the spatial component of animal health. A strategic approach is proposed that involves the collection of animal health information using active surveillance techniques and the introduction of a geographic information system. This approach should improve the management and reporting of animal health information.

J	Friedkin, NE; Johnsen, EC				Friedkin, NE; Johnsen, EC			Control loss and Fayol's gangplanks	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	20th International Sunbelt Social Network Conference	APR 15, 2000	VANCOUVER, CANADA	Int Sunbelt Social Network			CONSENSUS; MODELS	Williamson's (1971) model of control loss in organizational hierarchies describes the cumulative decay of influence of superiors over subordinates who are separated by a number of hierarchical levels in the chain-of-command. This paper shows that control loss may be deduced from a network theory of social influence, and it shows that ties among actors at the same hierarchical level-Fayol's gangplanks-may constrain control loss in organizational hierarchies. The structural mitigation of control loss by Fayol's gangplanks increases with superiors' span of control and depends on their capacity to maintain influence upon immediate subordinates in the presence of the lateral influences among subordinates.

J	Mackie, CM; Elliot, L; Thomson, DAM; Bigrigg, A; McAllister, KF				Mackie, CM; Elliot, L; Thomson, DAM; Bigrigg, A; McAllister, KF			Public and private collaboration in establishing a young person's sexual health clinic in a commercial setting	JOURNAL OF FAMILY PLANNING AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE			English	Article								Objective. To define the key factors and constraints in public private sector collaboration in establishing and delivering a young person's sexual health clinic within an existing commercial establishment. Consultation, planning and implementation phases. Consultations were held between the Health Promotion Department, family planning and commercial outlets, resulting in the establishment of the UK's first sexual health service within commercial premises. Once the clinic had been operational for 6 months, a single researcher carried out semi-structured interviews with 13 staff representing all levels within the partner organisations. Post-implementation interviews. There was agreement by all interviewees on the objectives of the clinic. The problems encountered during the establishment of the service were with the legislation pertaining to pharmacies and the adverse press coverage of a minority public view of the provision of sexual health services to young people. No respondent identified conflict between the aims of the clinic and the strategic objectives of their organisation. Recommendations. Common aims are imperative for successful interagency working. Wider initial consultations may have helped to identify potential problems and confirm common aims at an earlier stage of the development of the project. The involvement of senior management may also have improved the smooth running of the project.

J	Batchelder, E				Batchelder, E			Comparing three simultaneous measurements of a sociocognitive network	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article								Three data collection strategies are compared in their ability to measure a globally shared cognitive network representation, i.e. a sociocognitive network. Participant performances in data production using each of the three strategies are also assessed. Data were collected from 22 students in a graduate program. Each participant reported k out of 22 "ordinary" ties (Task 1, 0 less than or equal to k less than or equal to 22), in out of k "close" ties (Task 2, 0 less than or equal to m less than or equal to k), and "top three" ties (Task 3) for every actor in the network. Results revealed that each of the three tasks were quite similar to each other in measuring the sociocognitive network. The estimated average shared information among the actors about the network's structure, as revealed by each task, was highest for Task 2 and lowest for Task 1. Individual differences in performance indicate that the amount of shared knowledge as revealed by each task is not consistent across tasks. Overall, three-way data structures are shown to be sufficiently rich in information that any of the tasks are sufficient to capture the main features of a sociocognitive network.

J	Levesque, M; Shepherd, DA				Levesque, M; Shepherd, DA			A new venture's optimal entry time	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						strategic planning; market entry; timing; optimal stopping; entrepreneurship	PRODUCT LIFE-CYCLE; ORGANIZATIONAL ADAPTATION; MARKET SHARE; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; SURVIVAL; INDUSTRY; STRATEGY; FAILURE; GROWTH	We formulate a model of the decision of when a new venture should enter the market based on the uncertain evolution over time of environmental volatility and market competition. We characterize the performance-maximizing time to enter the market, and show how this entry time is affected by changes in the business environment. By further focusing our modeling assumptions, we are able to translate our time-based criteria into environmental terms and propose that management set a target environment level that must be met before entering the market. We also demonstrate that management should adjust this target over time to respond to changes in the business context. This modeling feature is important because it allows for a better assessment of when to enter a market based on future performances. We translate the model's theoretical insights into testable propositions, and explore possible ways to operationalize these for empirical testing. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Anttila, M				Anttila, M			The role of marketing and innovation management in the Finnish electrical and electronics industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						innovation management; marketing; market orientation; marketing capability; strategic management; the Miles and Snow typology; electronics industry	ORIENTATION; STRATEGY; PERFORMANCE; ENVIRONMENT	Very often in industrial companies the role of marketing is perceived from too narrow a perspective, A more comprehensive view of marketing identifies three distinct roles of marketing: marketing as business philosophy at corporate level, marketing as strategy at business level, and marketing as tactics (marketing mix) at functional level. Thus marketing is a synthesis of particular skills and practices learned and resources created translating the philosophy into specific business strategies in order to achieve competitive advantages and superior performance. The empirical study is based on a survey concerning a sample of manufacturing companies with national and international operations. The 42 companies or divisions comprise 38% of the member companies or divisions of the Finnish Electrical and Electronics Industry Association. Market orientation of these companies or divisions was assessed with MARKOR scale of Kohli, Jaworski and Kumar [1]. The Miles and Snow [2] strategy typology - prospectors, analysers, defenders and reactors - is a very extensively used approach when business strategy has been investigated, In this sample it was shown that market orientation is very high in the seven prospector companies or divisions and high or very high in the 26 analyser companies or divisions. Both prospectors and analysers are also keenly following latest developments in technology. Further, differences in business strategies and practices, as well as differences in marketing strategies and practices, innovation management between successful and unsuccessful companies or divisions and between companies or divisions at different levels of market orientation were examined. Emphasis in this research is on identifying strategies and practices of innovation management that enhance a close working relationship between marketing and R&D, and that enable companies to survive and thrive in the turbulent and competitive market environments, as in the electronics industry, at present and in the future.

J	Gerwin, D; Meister, D				Gerwin, D; Meister, D			Coordinating new product development in an international joint venture	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						new product development; international joint venture; strategic alliance; interorganisational coordination; interorganisational information systems	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; COOPERATION; PERFORMANCE	This is a case study of the problems in coordinating business functions (R&D and manufacturing) among firms engaged in a joint venture for new product development (NPD). The study focused on relationships across organisational boundaries, that is among the joint venture organisation and the two partner companies. A conceptual framework, based on the new product development and strategic alliance literatures, served as a guide in developing specific propositions from the inter-view data. The findings indicate that a partnership's task and task environment, specifically cross-company subunit interdependencies, produce requirements for inter-functional coordination between firms. Certain partner characteristics, however, hamper attaining the required coordination. These characteristics include the relative degree of concurrency of the partners' NPD processes and a partner's difficulty in establishing external information technology linkages. Aspects of the partners' relationship, specifically perceived appropriability risks, also hinder achieving the necessary coordination. The relative degree to which each partner has management control over the relationship influences perceived risks. These findings are put into perspective through a comparison of new product development in a partnership and in a single business unit.

An important aim of this research is to determine the feasibility of a 'boundary-based' view to organizing human resources during product development. This viewpoint stresses the need for firms to consider not only the strategic placement of formal organizational boundaries but also the concurrent development of innovative options for overcoming them. This paper presents some important grounded theoretical developments. They focus on the identification of an important mechanism-the informal organization used to overcome formal organization boundaries. The informal organization is based on a network of self-generated, self-organized and self-managed interrelationships between product developers. They form the foundations of effective and efficient flows of information, experience, knowledge and ideas during product development task activity. Consequently product development performance relies significantly on a formal recognition of the informal organization.

The results of the majority of research work carried out in this direction have been scattered and have not been applied in practice. In this context this paper is being brought out with the aim of reporting the literature survey conducted with the objective of evolving future direction of research imperatives for integrating TQM and BPR principles. The literature survey was carried out by using CD-ROM journal called Anbar Electronic Intelligence (AEI) (published by MCB University Press, UK) and by visiting the site maintained by Emerald Library, UK. On systematic analyses, it was found that the integration of BPR with the quality strategies identified in a theoretical Strategic Quality Management model would make a meaningful start in this direction.

J	Jones, RM; Kashlak, RJ				Jones, RM; Kashlak, RJ			Socio-regulatory upheaval, reference points and strategic evolution of the cigarette industry	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						socio-regulatory upheaval; reference points; strategic evolution; cigarette industry	DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY; PROFIT PERFORMANCE; PROSPECT-THEORY; RISK; DIVERSITY; FIRMS	During the past 3 decades, the US cigarette industry has seen increased social and political turbulence affect marker growth. The six major competitors (Phillip Morris (PM). R.J. Reynolds (RJR), American Tobacco, British American Tobacco (BAT), Lorillard and Liggett & Myers) have all responded to the increasingly unattractive environment through diversification efforts. Still, facing similar, hostile environments, the various patterns of product and international diversification of the firms have been divergent in terms of both scope and depth. The integration of strategic reference points offers a preliminary explanation for these divergent strategies. Finns who were industry leaders and industry laggards regarding average industry performance indicators were observed to take greater strategic risks in each decade. Finns performing at the industry median took relatively less risk in each decade. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Wong, HMY; Braithwaite, J				Wong, HMY; Braithwaite, J			Practice management: Observations, issues, and empirical evidence	JOURNAL OF PERIODONTOLOGY			English	Article						education, dental continuing; practice management, dental		Background: The primary objective of this study is to provide objective, empirical, evidence-based practice management information. This is a hitherto under-researched area of considerable interest for both the practitioner and educator. Methods: A questionnaire eliciting a mix of structured and free text responses was administered to a random sample of 480 practitioners who are members of the American Academy of Periodontology. Potential respondents not in private practice were excluded and the next listed person substituted, Results: The results provide demographic and descriptive information about some of the main issues and problems facing practice managers, central to which are information technology (IT), financial, people management, and marketing. Human resource and marketing management appear to represent the biggest challenges. Conclusions: Periodontists running practices would prefer more information, development, and support in dealing with IT, finance, marketing, and people management. The empirical evidence reported here suggests that although tailored educational programs on key management issues at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels have become ubiquitous, nevertheless some respondents seek further training opportunities. Evidence-based practice management information will be invaluable to the clinician considering strategic and marketing planning, and also for those responsible for the design and conduct of predoctoral and postdoctoral programs.

J	Brassler, A; Schneider, H				Brassler, A; Schneider, H			Valuation of strategic production decisions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						model design; strategic production decision; petri net theory; process value indicator; ratio system; decision making		The value chains in industry need to be competitively organised to enable them to meet market expectations. This involves identifying the critical strategic decisions for production and subjecting them to a valuation process to establish their economic effectiveness. It is obvious that strategic production decisions include many valuation problems. In the first place, a production system is a widely branching value chain with many interrelations. Changes in one area have effects in other areas. Secondly, in production, one never makes an isolated strategic decision. It will always be a bundle of interconnected measures. To tackle both problems at once, it might be useful to represent the production processes by a model, based on petri nets. With their help one can achieve an overall schematic representation of linked production processes, in which the input data can be derived from the case in point. The model is capable of evaluating alternative production strategies. Real situations and potentials decisions can be represented. Their effect on the production system will be calculated and an economic analysis provided. The data output from the model can be combined with external data from market sources so that a process value indicator (PVI) is derived. The PVI is then a performance indicator for both current and potential production systems. Its value can be used mathematically as an aggregated figure in valuation and decision-making.

J	Tolosi, P; Lajtha, G				Tolosi, P; Lajtha, G			Toward improved benchmarking indicators	TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY			English	Article						benchmarking; indicators; strategic planning; productivity measures	TELECOMMUNICATIONS	Benchmarking is a process which continuously measures the products, services and operational practices of a given organisation to compare the organisation's performance and operational practices with a selected sample group. It is a good development tool because, in addition to creating a basis for comparison, it enforces a self-critical approach, indicating the points of operation the company must improve. Benchmarking is coming into increasing use in telecoms by management, regulators and international agencies like ITU and OECD, and offers potential for many useful applications. However, benchmarking must be used with caution, and its design as a tool of analysis must be thoughtfully considered in order to achieve accurate and meaningful indicators. The specific aspects of production, and the companies to be used for benchmarking comparison must be carefully selected. Some possibilities for developing dynamic benchmark indicators are explored.

J	Khiaonarong, T				Khiaonarong, T			Electronic payment systems development in Thailand	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						electronic payment systems; electronic data interchange; strategic information systems; banking strategies	STRATEGY; BANKING	This paper examines the creation of modern electronic payment systems in Thailand. Thailand, like other major developed and emerging economies, experienced payment systems reforms in the 1990s. The country's economic expansion, which started in the late-1980s but unexpectedly ended in the late-1990s, led to the development of three major payment systems. The central bank played a leading role, in the absence of private sector initiative, in investing, developing, enhancing and managing these systems. This included the introduction of a real-time gross settlement system, which became one of the most advanced large-value funds transfer systems in the world during its launch date. The case illustrates the experiences undertaken, in the reform of rudimentary payment systems in an emerging economy context, and the lessons may be relevant for countries facing similar stages of development. Such experiences has also raised relevant issues, including the development of laws supporting electronic payments, the providing of liquidity for payment settlements, the inclusion of risk reduction measures, the reduction of cheque float through electronic data interchange, and the management of change in payment systems.

J	Bart, CK				Bart, CK			The relationship between mission and innovativeness in the airline industry: an exploratory investigation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						mission statements; vision statements; corporate values; airline industry	HEALTH-CARE SECTOR; STATEMENT	Mission statements have been called the critical starting point for enhancing firm innovativeness. They are essential for strategic planning and have been shown to be linked with new product success. The current study asks the question: does the general model of the relationship between mission and organizational innovativeness apply in the specific case of a particular industry: air transportation? For the most part, the study's findings confirm our earlier notions about mission and firm innovativeness. However, there are significant and notable exceptions that suggest that there may be 'industry effects'.

J	Tiamiyu, MA				Tiamiyu, MA			Information technology in Nigerian federal agencies: problems, impact and strategies	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article								The paper assesses the perceptions of personnel of Nigerian federal public agencies about obstacles to information technology (IT) use, the impact of computers on agency departments and tasks and about approaches to IT human resource development. The analyses are based on data from a questionnaire survey of the personnel of ministries, parastatals and Government-controlled banks who participated in various training programmes of the (Nigerian) National Centre for Economic Management and Administration (NCEMA) during 1997. The survey revealed that due to either lack of computing technologies in most of the agencies or of their ineffective exploitation, the majority of the personnel were, as recently as 1997, still unaware of, or unimpressed by, the productivity potentials of using computers in their agencies. However, they were eager for exposure to computer applications in their work. They also preferred informal and work-related training formats which, in their view, should most appropriately begin with middle-level personnel in the agencies. These and other perceptions suggest that most Nigerian public agencies are in the pre-computing, or very early, stages of the computing culture, hence their focus was more on understanding how to use computers to perform traditional and internal data processing chores than on providing strategic and client-targeted services.

J	Masterton, RG				Masterton, RG			Antibiotic policies and the role of strategic hospital leadership	JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL INFECTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference of the Hospital-Infection-Society	SEP 13-17, 1998	EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND	Hosp Infect Soc		antibiotic policies; hospital leadership		Operational aspects, programme construction and implementation are all essential components of antimicrobial control but are not the direct remit of management and must rest with the professional provider. Hospital leaders call influence antibiotic control through the priority they give it. This must not be purely financially driven and must incorporate an awareness of issues surrounding patient care. Such attitudes should encompass the consequences of poor prescribing practices in both human and corporate terms. A leader's recognition of these elements can be expressed through securing resources ill terms of both the human and hardware components. The best signalling of the status of this activity is through ensuring its inclusion in clinical governance and organisational Board reports. The goals for hospital leaders should be evidence of effective working practices and the execution of their own responsibilities by championing robust structures and procedures are in place. Potent hospital leadership delivered to the focus of antimicrobial control programmes is a major tool for their success. (C) 1999 The Hospital Infection Society.

The central theme of the Master Builder Program is: building process integration, which is a systems or integrated approach to the planning, design, construction, and management of constructed facilities. Building process integration was chosen as a strategic plan to focus on one segment of the building industry, to provide a unique educational product, to exhibit the strengths of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and to distinguish the program from practice-oriented graduate degree programs that have been established at competing colleges and universities. The 30-credit-hour curriculum includes two required courses, a capstone project, and electives. Faculty collaboration and industrial participation are critical elements of the program.

J	de Nooy, W				de Nooy, W			The sign of affection - Balance-theoretic models and incomplete signed digraphs	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th International Sunbelt Social Network Conference	MAY, 1998	SITGES, SPAIN					The initial structural models based on balance theory (structural balance and clusterability) dealt with incomplete signed digraphs. However, newer models (ranked clusters, transitivity, hierarchical M-cliques) apply only to zero-one matrices representing either unsigned digraphs or complete signed digraphs. Since empirical networks of affective relations are signed but seldom complete - actors may have neutral feelings towards alters or affections may be unknown to the researcher - the latter models must be redefined if affective relations are to be analysed. It was found that each balance-theoretic model is characterised by a particular type of semicycle or path. Counts of the types of semicycles and paths suffice to identify the models. This approach is more general than triadic analysis because it handles complete as well as incomplete signed digraphs. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hill, L; Kikulis, LM				Hill, L; Kikulis, LM			Contemplating restructuring: A case study of strategic decision making in interuniversity athletic conferences	JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT			English	Article							ORGANIZATIONS; POWER	This research examines the dynamics of strategic decision making within the western Canadian university athletic system. Using a framework developed from the Bradford studies (Hickson, Butler, Gray, Mallory, & Wilson, 1986) and Butler (1991), we focused on three key elements of decision making: complexity, politicality, and the rules of the game. Using these concepts, this paper presents a case study analysis of the decision process that centered around the potential restructuring of the Canada West University Athletic Association and the Great Plains Athletic Conference. Qualitative research methods were used to collect and analyze data from documents and interview transcripts. The results show that the diversity of interests, level of influence, and both the constraining and enabling rules of the game contribute to the way the decision topic of restructuring was interpreted, what behaviors were enacted, and how the decision making process emerged to deaf with this topic.

J	Smelser, NJ				Smelser, NJ			Looking back at 25 years of sociology and the Annual Review of Sociology	ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; SEX-ROLES; MOVEMENTS; MODELS; LABOR	This essay engages the daunting task of encapsulating and reflecting on the 25 year history of the Annual Review of Sociology. After giving a short account of my own involvement in ARS, I give a brief rendition of what sociology as a field has been during the past quarter century-that is, what was "out there" to be reflected in the pages of ARS. I lay out some statistics on trends in the size, countries, and universities represented, coauthorship patterns, and gender ratios in ARS. These statistics are very informative but contain few surprises. Next I trace and analyze an issue that has commmanded the attention of editors of ARS throughout its history-unity or diversity of sociology as a discipline. Finally I conclude that the ARS does indeed reflect the field in ways that can be documented, but that this process of reflection is subject to many imprecisions generated by the editorial process itself.

J	Langabeer, J				Langabeer, J			Competitive strategy in turbulent healthcare markets: An analysis of financially effective teaching hospitals	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article							PERFORMANCE	As the healthcare marketplace, characterized by declining revenues and heavy price competition, continues to evolve toward managed care, teaching hospitals are being forced to act more like traditional industrial organizations. Profit-oriented behavior, including emphases on market strategies and competitive advantage, is now a necessity if these hospitals are going to survive the transition to managed care. To help teaching hospitals evaluate strategic options that maximize financial effectiveness, this study examined the financial and operating data for 100 major U.S. teaching hospitals to determine relationships among competitive strategy, market environment, and financial return on invested capital. Results should help major hospitals formulate more effective strategies to combat environmental turbulence.

J	Batte, MT; Bacon, KJ; Hopkins, JW				Batte, MT; Bacon, KJ; Hopkins, JW			Measures of economic and environmental performance for alternative agricultural production systems	JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE			English	Article							PROGRAM	The primary purpose of the reported research was to evaluate the economic and environmental performance of three production systems under study in the Ohio Buried Valley Aquifer Management Systems Evaluation Area (MSEA) project. The three systems studied included a monoculture system-continuous corn (Zea mays L.) (chisel plow) with routine fertilizer and pesticide treatments; the typical system-a corn/soybean [Glycine mm (L.) Merr.] rotation (chisel plow and no-till) with routine applications of pesticides and fertilizers; and an alternative system-a corn/soybean/wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth subsp, villosa) rotation (ridge-tilled) with fertilization based on soil tests and strategic applications of pesticides, Enterprise and whole farm budgets were constructed for each system. All sources of receipts and costs arising from production were recognized in the profitability analysis. The typical system was found to have the highest return to management and the monoculture system the lowest return. The alternative system produced net returns of about 50% of those of the typical system. The wheat phase of the alternative system was the primary source of reduced returns. A linear programming analysis was conducted to compare profitability for the three systems with farm size variable (machinery complement capacity was the determinant of farm size). The LP results suggested a widening of the profit differential between typical and alternative systems due to a greater acreage capacity for the typical system. However, results suggested that if wheat yields were increased through spring application of N fertilizer for wheat, the alternative system would be about equal in profits to the typical system. Environmental impact assessment, evaluated through use of the Erosion-Productivity impact Calculator (EPIC), suggested lesser environmental consequences resulting from the alternative system than from either of the other studied systems. Adjustments in the alternative system to improve profitability brought little environmental downside.

J	Broady-Preston, J; Hayward, TE				Broady-Preston, J; Hayward, TE			An assessment of the relationship between marketing, information and strategy formulation in the UK retail banking sector	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article								In the expanding retail banking sector of the 1990s, companies have to become increasingly customer-focused. Due to intense competition and the rapidity of change in the external environment, strategic planning in the industry has had to focus more directly on the customer, resulting in a 'bottom-up' approach to strategy formulation,Thus, marketing concepts are being depended upon increasingly for the provision of strategic insights. However, formalised, structured approaches to strategic planning are now largely moribund, Information to guide strategic development is crucial, and the development of scanning and analysis tools to track key market conditions is explored. The relevance of tools such as the balanced scorecard and the Business Excellence Model are evaluated for their role in bringing together information, and in recognising what underpins commercial success. The value of gathering internal customer-based, as well as external customer-based, information is assessed, concluding that this gives banks the opportunity to become truly customer focused in their strategy formulation.

J	Payson, S				Payson, S			Quality improvement versus cost reduction: A broader perspective on evolutionary economic change	TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT			English	Article								A new framework is explored for analyzing scientific and engineering advances by their economic, business and social effects. For this framework, scientific and engineering advances are categorized in two contexts: the function served by the good(s) or service(s) associated with the advance, and whether the advance, and whether the advance is directed toward the goal of cost reduction or quality improvement. It is argued that this categorization can be used to identify important patterns of technological change, and allow for better understanding of industrial research and development, as well as improved national strategies for economic growth. Data are obtained on scientific and engineering advances that might be of interest to business investors and managers, based on 783 news stories in 1994 in the business journals Business Week, Forbes, Fortune and The Economist. The approach taken is compared with traditional economic approaches to technological change, which are often constrained by archaic methods of categorizing data.

These business process-related technologies, in turn, are invariably related to existing and emerging information and communication technologies. The function of the self-diagnostic methodology is to guide the SME technology manager through an analysis of the competitive impact of the firm's technological capabilities relating to business processes. The methodology ultimately leads the manager to the point where he or she can formulate strategic recommendations and develop a strategic plan for building a competitive business process-related technological platform. The work discussed here is part of an ongoing development effort within the framework of the European Commission-sponsored TBPTIME project [1]. As such, the work reported here represents work-in-progress. The paper concludes with a discussion of experiences made with the methodology in validation sessions with client companies to date.

Increasingly, technological innovation requires the fusion of multiple technological disciplines, deeper and deeper technical skills, and early availability of market knowledge. This increases the need of firms to access external sources of technical knowledge and information (markets, customers and technology suppliers), and to rely on technological collaborations. This paper attempts to identify effective practices to manage technological partnering. It is based on the results of an empirical investigation on seven cases of technological partnerships in high-tech industry.

J	Crouch, A				Crouch, A			Reframing the strategic problem: An accommodation of harmony and belligerence in strategic management	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article							RIVALRY; ATTACK	Competitive behavior among firms is typically characterized in theory by stable and harmonious relationships among companies responding to customer demand within a market. However shifts from this overall pattern of competitive behavior can be found within industries fi-om time to time as firms Enter interludes of intercorporate instability and disharmony, even belligerence. This article proposes a model which accounts for such shifts in the character of rivalry between firms. Adopting the mental model of the strategic thinker as the unit of analysis, two planes of strategic thinking are proposed. One is a portrayal of stable competitive behavior governed by concepts of purpose, markets, growth, and corporate interests. The other, the plane of belligerence, involves thinking about action initiatives, deception, disorder, and competitor intelligence. It is hypothesized that shifts between modes of strategic thinking are governed by perceptions of order in protection of a firm's vital interests. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	Scholten, CRM; Roex, AJM; Sindram, JW				Scholten, CRM; Roex, AJM; Sindram, JW			Cost-control and medical specialist payment: The Dutch alternative	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						payment system; status; cost-control		The fee-for-service system is a growing problem for insurers and governments. The main reason for this is the open-ended character of this system which makes cost-control a very difficult task. The pressures on the fee-for-service system are becoming more pronounced, especially in countries such as Canada, Germany and the Netherlands which use budget restrictions on national health care expenditure (macro caps). In these countries policy makers are searching for an alternative payment system and an appropriate definition of a corresponding status for doctors. The alternative, however, does not have to lead automatically to a salaried status of doctors in the hospital organization. The Dutch experience of the change of the payment system for medical specialists illustrates the transition to a new 'negotiated order'. The introduction of the 'lump sum' and the sub-contractor relationship with the insurance companies leaves the organizational autonomy of medical specialists intact. In exchange the medical specialists cooperate with the insurers in trying to control the costs of health care. In this process of strategic change, two factors are very significant: i.e. the new leadership of the local medical specialists and the governmental 'circumvention' of the powerful associations of doctors and insurers.

J	Westwood, RI; Kirkbride, PS				Westwood, RI; Kirkbride, PS			International strategies of corporate culture change: emulation, consumption and hybridity	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						China; corporate culture; Hong Kong; national cultures; organizational symbols	ORGANIZATION	The paper describes the symbolic representation of corporate culture within the context of a Hong Kong Chinese company in the broader context of strategic responses to the international intersection of organisation and management systems. This symbolic representation incorporates and indexes aspects of a Western culturally constituted world that is largely alien to one important stakeholder group, namely, the Chinese organisation membership. Such a disjuncture engenders an inhibition to an effective reading of the corporate culture message, so weakening the effect of the intended change. The paper discusses three interlocking themes. First, the issue of the emulation of the corporate culture notion, as conceived and formulated in the USA, in other cultural settings. Second, a consideration of a multi-stakeholder perspective on corporate culture, in which it is considered as a strategic move with respect to externalities rather than the internal system. Third, the intersection of management systems which results in mutual inter-penetrations, thus engendering responses of appropriation, adaptation and hybridity rather than merely imposition of assimilation. The author feels such interactive aspects of international business and the associated responses are in need of greater attention.

J	Grover, V				Grover, V			An extension of the tri-core model of information systems innovation: strategic and technological moderators	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION; ADOPTION; MANAGEMENT; DIFFUSION	There has been significant empirical work on information systems (IS) innovation. With the advent of a myriad of new and diverse technologies being introduced into contemporary organizations this work is only going to increase in its importance. Unfortunately, results of prior empirical work have been fragmented. Many of these studies treat IS innovations as homogeneous entities and do not effectively integrate notions of IS innovation with general organizational innovation. Swanson (1994) proposes a tri-core model and theory of IS innovation that can help integrate the isolated studies in this area, and can form the foundation on which future study of IS innovation can be based. This paper, in the spirit of a cumulative research tradition, presents and builds on Swanson's framework by incorporating contingencies that might affect the model. Specifically, notions of strategy (strategic push) and technology impact are discussed in the context of the framework. We hope that continued inquiry into this area will facilitate formulation of rich theory that will enable focused inquiry on IS innovation.

J	Goodman, RE; Chinowsky, PS				Goodman, RE; Chinowsky, PS			Preparing construction professionals for executive decision making	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Increased competition and changing client demands are requiring construction executives to address a wider range of issues than ever before in areas such as strategic analysis, knowledge management, and emerging technologies. However, the education structures in the construction industry, both at the university and professional levels, fail to provide construction professionals with the tools required to fully address these emerging forces. With a project management tradition, construction management education faces a challenge to expand executive level educational opportunities for students and professionals. In response to this challenge, this paper introduces one effort currently underway at the Georgia Institute of Technology to identify what will comprise the emerging construction executive knowledge set, and how it can be incorporated into models for developing construction executives. The paper introduces the approach and preliminary findings of this research effort, emphasizing the reasons why a new set of resources, designed for executive level performance, is important to the future of the construction industry.

More recent developments in health care have included an emphasis on ''outcome management,'' as well as an enthusiasm for applying industrial process improvement methods. Health care organizations may choose to incorporate process surveillance as an adjunct to or a surrogate for outcome measurement. An essential characteristic of a well-designed process surveillance program is a direct relationship with clearly articulated and logically prioritized outcome objectives. To optimize value and efficacy the program design should be consistent with the organizational strategic plan and sensitive to the needs of members of the health care team to which the data would be reported. Process data must be objectively and consistently measurable, feasible to collect, and, ideally, expressed as rates or ratios to support valid comparative analyses.

J	Braun, N				Braun, N			A rational choice model of network status	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article							EXCHANGE NETWORKS; POWER; CENTRALITY	This paper models network relations as inter-individual investments. Accordingly, actors choose, in a competitive setting, their investments into others to realize their interests in control over network ties. The central model outcome is the equilibrium price vector of (relations with) network members. It represents, from a structural point of view, a new status index. The latter reduces, for specific conditions, to Bonacich's two-parametric centrality measure and, thereby, provides a way to estimate the parameters of that measure.

J	Feld, SL				Feld, SL			Network analysis using the method of path lists: Testing the weak ties hypothesis	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article							SUPPORT	A central contribution of network analysis is the recognition of the value of considering various sociological units of analysis; e.g. individuals, ties, connected triples of individuals. The 'path list' approach is based upon developing data files corresponding with each relevant unit of analysis, stating hypotheses in terms of particular units of analysis, and testing those hypotheses using the relevant data files. Data files are constructed from initial lists of ties using three basic file manipulation operations: (a) concatenating, (b) aggregating, and (c) matching; then, hypotheses are tested by examining associations among the variables in these files. This paper specifically shows how Granovetter's 'weak ties hypothesis' can be tested using the method of path lists. An appendix includes SPSS programs to implement the method of path lists for this task; other computer packages can also be used to implement the path list approach.

J	Burns, L; Adams, M				Burns, L; Adams, M			Alcohol-history taking by nurses and doctors - How accurate are they really?	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article								The aim of this study was to look at how nurses and doctors record alcohol histories on the patients under their care and the frequency and appropriateness of the way they use an alcohol withdrawal scale in the acute hospital setting. To achieve these aims patient records were audited and compared at two points in time, in 1992 and 1994, Results of the study showed that nurses and doctors took alcohol histories from patients on approximately three-quarters of occasions and that this level of recording has not changed over time, The adequacy of alcohol-history taking has, however, increased for both nurses and doctors since 1992. At that time, 71% of the alcohol histories taken by nurses and 74% of alcohol histories taken by doctors were judged to be adequate. By 1994, however, 79% of alcohol histories taken by nurses and 77% Of histories by doctors were rated as adequate. The increase in the adequacy of history taking by nurses was significant (chi(2) = 5 . 05; d.f.=1; P<0 . 05) and the increase by doctors was not significant (chi(2)=1 . 03; d.f.=1; P>0 . 05). These results are seen as being positively associated with the major governmental nursing initiative in New South Wales, Australia, the New South Wales Strategic Plan for the Nursing Management of Alcohol and Other Drugs.

Highlights the stories of the managers, both visually and structurally, and places the academic discourse of theory and method in diversity of the journeys taken in an attempt to manage decline in one industry. Suggests that, hom the manager's perspective, destination is determined by (and after) the journey, and not vice versa as suggested in the classical strategic management literature.

J	Stainer, A				Stainer, A			Productivity and strategic management accounting	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						benchmarking; capital input; European; performance measures; productivity; strategic management accounting		Productivity is defined and presented in both its performance measurement role and its strategic context for manufacturing and service sectors. The development of productivity, especially total productivity, and its connection with management accounting is highlighted. The inter-relationship of productivity analysis to competitive advantage and technology is also discussed. Strategic management accounting, incorporating productivity, is shown to focus on price recovery and profitability with alternative methods revealed. The approach for external estimations for competitive analysis, utilising benchmarking, is set out. Capital input within productivity measurement is studied, specifically examining inflation, technological change and capacity maintenance. Allied to total productivity, a methodology is put forward for capital input for strategic analysis.

The growing concern about the ability of high-technology firms to market their products and services effectively has increased interest in the marketing strategies and promotional techniques that work best, This study investigates the perceptions of high-technology executives from firms with different levels of innovativeness regarding which strategic factors and promotional methods are most effective. In addition, high-technology firms' expenditures on strategic and promotional factors are compared by level of innovativeness, Conclusions indicate that the firms with greater innovation are mote aggressive, take greater risks and possess a more creative and outward-looking attitude.

J	DeGraba, P				DeGraba, P			Most-favored-customer clauses and multilateral contracting: When nondiscrimination implies uniformity	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article							MONOPOLY	DeGraba and Postlewaite (1992) show that the seller of a durable input can solve the time inconsistency problem by offering most-favored-customer (MFC) protection to buyers. McAfee and Schwartz (1994) show that if a supplier sells inputs to competing firms using two-part tariffs, MFC protection that allows a firm to replace its contract with a contract executed by any other firm will not solve the commitment problem, and argue this implies managers cannot use MFCs as a strategic commitment device in complex contracting situations. This paper shows that if the profits of the seller and the buyers are monotonic in each term of the contract, then applying MFC protection to each term of a contract allows a manager to solve his commitment problem in complex contacting situations. We show that ''standard'' contract arrangements (two-part tariffs, declining block tariffs, and royalties as a percentage of sales) meet this condition.

J	Emmett, EA				Emmett, EA			What is the strategic value of occupational and environmental medicine? Observations from the United States and Australia	JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article							WORKERS COMPENSATION; HEALTH; INJURY; PHYSICIANS; WORKPLACE; COSTS	The world of work is changing rapidly. Occupational health and safety and environmental health increasingly are seen as a joint product with goods and services, requiring line-management responsibility, This new specialty is encouraged to be strategic rather than tactical to optimize its value in the core business of industry-related medical needs. Because employers, governments, and workers bear major costs, they have a strategic interest in outcomes. strategic opportunities exist for reduction of the impact of occupational injury and disease; stewardship, of the environment, product, and process; the reduction of nonoccupational health care costs; for having occupational and environmental health and safety follow best business practices and be prominent in the leadership of change; for optimizing human relations/labor policies and practices; and for meeting regulatory requirements, The strategic position of the specialty can be strengthened through discussion, dialogue and vision development, role definition, establishment and use of performance indicators, improved career structures and training, and a proactive approach to quality initiatives, research, marketing, and strategic alliances.

J	Adams, M				Adams, M			Activity-based costing (ABC) and the life insurance industry	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article								This paper describes the concept of activity-based costing (ABC) and examines its relevance to the life insurance industry. The paper contends that the high overheads and diversified product lines of many life insurance companies makes them appropriate environments within which to apply ABC. It is considered that ABC can provide at least three important benefits to a life insurance company, namely: more accurate cost information, closer insights into the costs of production and better information concerning the strategic consequences of business decisions. These attributes can help a life insurance company To achieve important business objectives, such as the management of expenses and the continuous improvement in the quality of its products and services. However the transition to ABC is not easy and it cannot be seen as a panacea for all corporate woes. Nevertheless, the paper concludes that with sound project management, an ABC system can provide life insurance companies with much better information for activity management and the achievement of longer term strategic goals.

Despite further improvements at the level of routine transactions and a strong increase in perceptions that the benefits of the new system offset the costs to agents, divergent goals and greater agent uncertainty about how the ATO would use its monitoring capacity and regulatory authority appear to have restricted the system's positive contributions to regulatory strategy.

The use of iteration between data collection and model refinement in order to ensure the programme remains focused on key uncertainties is discussed. These iterations are described as cycles of site characterization. A broad framework for site characterization activities is discussed, which identifies the work under three broad headings; potential repository zone (PRZ) studies, regional studies and hydrochemical studies. Work performed under previous cycles of site characterization is summarized and activities planned for the next cycle of site characterization are presented. These are placed in context with the uncertainty which they are designed to address. The paper concludes by restating the need for the programme of site characterization undertaken by Nirex to be flexible, and to evolve as necessary to ensure new understanding is accommodated, and used to redefine strategy on a regular basis.

J	Barnette, JE; Clendenen, F				Barnette, JE; Clendenen, F			The quality journey in a comprehensive mental health center: A case study	JOINT COMMISSION JOURNAL ON QUALITY IMPROVEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st National Conference on Total Quality Management in Mental Health	MAY 04-05, 1995	ST LOUIS, MO	Univ Missouri, Inst Mental Hlth, Excellence Missouri Fdn, Amer Network Community Opt & Resources, Fulton State Hosp, St Louis Mental Hlth Ctr, St Louis Dev Disabil Treatment Ctr			MANAGEMENT	Background: In early 1992 the chief executive officer (CEO) and consequently the senior leadership of Shawnee Hills, a mental health care organization comprising more than 65 facilities in West Virginia, decided to begin the journey toward total quality management (TQM). TQM provided guidance for establishing an infrastructure for planned organizational change and continuous improvement while maintaining the CEO's responsibility to set the vision and provide direction. TQM's impact: Absenteeism and turnover rates have decreased, which are felt to reflect increasingly high levels of staff satisfaction. The tripling of the operating budget from 1993 to 1995 is also considered a byproduct of TQM. TQM has increased the potential for this organization's success in the new health care environment by providing an infrastructure for ''managing'' managed care. Implementing TQM: Setting forth the vision, purpose, mission, and goals required a focus on customer satisfaction and the development of partnerships, empowerment, and teamwork. The leadership identified strategic indicators for critical success factors-customer satisfaction, positioning for future success, financial viability, and safe and professional environments-and teams were formed to address how improvements can be made. Benchmarking and reengineering: If a problem is minimal or average, processes are improved. If it is severe, reengineering is indicated. For example, each program at Shawnee Hills had its own intake procedure. To simplify access to service, it was determined that a single point of entry was needed, requiring a total redesign of current operations. Conclusion: Although not a panacea for all the problems an organization might be experiencing, TQM does provide guidance and direction to organizations in an ever-changing environment.

J	Chakraborty, S; Philip, T				Chakraborty, S; Philip, T			Vendor development strategies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							FLEXIBILITY; FIRM	Unprecedented changes sweeping the world during the last few years have given rise to the need for the development and adoption of contingency strategies. This requires firms to have strategic flexibility in every aspect of their operation. Vendor development strategies constitute an important component in achieving this flexibility. Attempts to draw up an explicit conceptual link between generic business unit strategies and generic vendor development strategies. Proposes a vendor structure framework with three dimensions representing vendor structure scope, vendor structure relationship and vendor structure focus. Uses the framework to develop certain generic vendor development strategies. Considers the four generic strategies suggested by Porter, namely industry-wide cost leadership strategy, industry-wide differentiation strategy, segment cost leadership strategy and segment differentiation strategy and, for each one of these, proposes appropriate vendor development strategies.

J	Douglas, J				Douglas, J			Fossil assets management: Making decisions on older plants	EPRI JOURNAL			English	Article								Deregulation of the bulk power market is prompting many electric utilities to reexamine their older fossil generating units to see how they fit into the company's overall operating strategy and whether they should be retired or modified to help the company become more competitive. EPRI's Fossil Assets Management methodologies provide a formal value-analysis process for determining which investment and utilization options for fossil plants provide the greatest benefits at the corporate level. Three major types of asset management decisions are involved: how to deploy each unit in a utility's fossil plant fleet, what investments should be made at specific plants, and how to modify operation and maintenance practices in view of present equipment condition. EPRI has also developed the Strategic Asset Management methodology, which focuses on even broader alternatives for allocating budgets and staff time across the utility. The FAM and SAM methodologies can be used together to analyze a full suite of asset management decisions, ranging from corporate-level reorganization to key equipment purchases at specific plants.										0	5	5	0	0	ELECTRIC POWER RESEARCH INST	PALO ALTO	BOX 10412 3412 HILLVIEW AVE, PALO ALTO, CA 94303	0362-3416			EPRI J	Epri J.

J	Kennedy, MD; Galtz, N				Kennedy, MD; Galtz, N			From Marxism to postcommunism: Socialist desires and East European rejections	ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY			English	Article						Russia; market economy; civil society; ideology and identity; class	TRANSITION; INTELLECTUALS; CONSTITUTION; RUSSIA	In this review of the relationship between marxism and East European transformations since 1989, we consider why Eastern Europe is so important to marxism and how marxists have addressed its transformations. We also point to similar analyses of these transformations generated by nonmarxists, and we review exemplary East European interpretations of marxism to demonstrate that the principal challenge in developing marxism in Eastern Europe lies outside its traditional substantive foci and methodological practices. We propose that in order for marxism to maintain itself as an integrated project without ignoring or dismissing Eastern Europe, it must do more than address questions of class and capitalist formation, problems that can be analyzed in parallel fashion without commitment to the normative aspect of socialism. It must also address directly the region's experience with, and rejection of, ''really existing socialism,'' rather than dismissing these and thereby allowing socialism to function as an ontologically absent but epistemologically structuring desire. In order for marxism to develop further in East European studies, we suggest it must find a way to rearticulate socialism's transcendent project within East European lifeworlds, a task grounded as much in discursive analyses of ideologies and identities as in the political economy of transformations.

J	HASAN, H; LAMPITSI, S				HASAN, H; LAMPITSI, S			EXECUTIVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION-SYSTEMS IN AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC ORGANIZATIONS	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						PUBLIC ORGANIZATIONS; MANAGEMENT INFORMATION; EXECUTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS (EIS); STRATEGIC GOALS		Senior executives in all organizations require information for strategic decision making and are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of the quality of their information systems. There is a continual increase in the numbers of executives who are directly accessing computerized information, however, when they do, there are significant consequences throughout the organization. Information systems personnel are often sceptical of the value of executive use of information technology and fear that increased managerial scrutiny may highlight flaws and deficiencies in 'their' systems. Managers of functional production and support units, who see themselves as 'owners' of data in systems under their control, are disturbed by the prospect that executives will have on-line access to organizational data. This paper reports the findings of a multiple case study of executive information systems, and executive computer use, in medium-sized Australian public organizations. As top management becomes more directly involved in the organization's information systems, problems with the information Bow around the organization are highlighted. At the same time the opportunity arises to improve the alignment of the organization's information systems with strategic organizational goals. Management must then decide who should be responsible for the content and delivery of computer based information for strategic control and decision making.

To secure the highest utilization rate and maximum productivity of manufacturing systems, it is necessary to be able to find the right information at the right time and at the right place: Just In Time. Non production and inefficiency in single operated, stand-along NC-machine tools and other NC-equipment are due largely to humanly caused elapsed times between the receipt of information, the formulation of a decision and the performance of the command. The advantages of Flexible Manufacturing systems (FMS) are obvious if they are compared to stand-along machines, FMS-concepts, hardware and software-state of the art, are designed mostly on the idea of centralized control, These types of systems are difficult and expensive to expand and maintain. Centralization makes the FMS dependent on a network and a main computer that might cause troubles with breakdowns. This paper presents solutions for decentralization and real-time data management of the control system of an FMS. An FMS has to be capable of controlling its resources and its state in real-time and take care of the connections to upper levels of enterprise network (CIM). This leads to the use of real time multi-tasking operating systems and suitable software for system developing. Relational Database Management systems (RDBMS) are very common in administrative use but in process-control information management solutions are still based on traditional ways of programming. Standard RDBMSs offer an easier way to integrate the manufacturing information system with other computer aided (CA-) subsystems through Local Area Networks (LANs). Dependency on the format in which the data is stored is not so crucial if the strategic decision of the company-wide standard for data management has been approved. The most useful approach to factory systems integration is the modularity of flexible components that are to be implemented to the system. Only in this way it is possible to design systems that are flexible and expandable also in the future. When the system is implemented the technology is at the certain level and the requirements for the products made in the system are well known, In the future, demands to expand the system with new facilities might become topical, If there is already a modular system it is not a great problem to install new equipment in the system.

It is proposed here that Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) may provide an useful addition to these procedures. To illustrate the process, a CFA model based on simulated data is presented and tested. The results of this simulation are employed to make recommendations for conducting CFA to test for cross-situational consistency.

J	BYE, P; CHANARON, JJ				BYE, P; CHANARON, JJ			TECHNOLOGY TRAJECTORIES AND STRATEGIES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INNOVATION; TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT; STRATEGY; TRAJECTORY	R-AND-D; TECHNICAL CHANGE; INNOVATION	While research and development expenditure and investment have been recognized for the last 50 years as one of the key factors explaining growth and industrial dynamics on a macro-economic level, the literature concerning the functions and role of R&D at firm level is much more recent and often limited to case studies and specific periods or contexts. Most of these analyses tend to be descriptive and their conclusions are often unsatisfactory. This paper, which is explicitly based on evolutionary background, aims to highlight the relation between the position of a firm within a technology trajectory and the means allotted to creative technology activities. A part of these means is acquired with private or public institutions while the other part depends upon the firm's knowledge portfolio and culture. There are, however, three types of difficulty involved here: difficulties resulting from the heterogeneity of the theoretical references; the problem of the incompatibility between the indicators and instruments evolved by these different theoretical references; and, lastly, the use in micro-economic analysis of concepts and methods adapted from macro-economic analysis and which are not transposable. The paper is dealing with three main themes: the dynamics of technology; the structure or composition of R&D costs according to the position of a firm along its technology trajectory; the strategic and organizational questions which follow from this relationship.

This study explores the influences of the SMI on the European retail sector and discusses the strategic trends emerging from recent changes. The study is based on secondary sources of data as well as on personal interviews throughout Europe. The results indicate that although retailing in Europe remains fragmented, very competitive, and dominated by small and medium-sized firms, large, world-class retailers are emerging/entering the European retailing scene and intensifying competition.

The first two sections describe the key features of the Israeli health care system before the reform, and their strengths and weaknesses. A State Commission of Inquiry, established by the government in 1988, proposed in its 1990 report two different reform strategies, respectively developed by the majority and the minority in it. The Commission diagnoses, recommendations and strategies are assessed and explained in the next sections. Legislators and policy makers opted for the incremental, evolutionary reform strategy, proposed by the minority in the Commission. The essence of the reform strategy being implemented as from 1995 is presented and examined in the penultimate section. In the concluding part, the Israeli experience with the formulation and implementation of a health care reform is discussed.

The companies examined are based in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park in Taiwan, and the studied attributes include scale, the industrial environment and the relative competence. The attitude of the company and its actual practice are found to be the key factors for the success of the alliance.

We use a dynamic model of firm performance to estimate the community structure of competitive and mutualistic interactions among firms operating in five sectors of the Canadian economy. The results show how the performance of large firms operating in each economic sector is enhanced or diminished by the performance of firms operating in other sectors through a complex systems of interdependencies. These relationships bind the sectors of the Canadian economy into an integrated organizational community. Unfortunately, the community structure revealed by the analysis has dysfunctional properties detrimental to the economy's effectiveness. The implications of the study for theory and public policy are discussed.

J	SHEU, C				SHEU, C			LINKING MARKET FACTORS TO MANUFACTURING DESIGNS	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MANUFACTURING STRATEGY; FOCUSED MANUFACTURING; MANUFACTURING PROCESS DESIGN; HEURISTICS	STRATEGY	This paper presents a heuristic method for designing manufacturing focus in batch manufacturing facilities. Although the benefits of manufacturing focus have been articulated in the literature, methods of implementation with the consideration of resource requirements have not been previously developed. In this study, we discuss the importance of including resource aspect, and propose a methodology that can help managers arrive at a focus design with minimum resource needs. The methodology translates the strategic concept of competitive priorities into management parameters, thereby allowing incorporation of market factors into manufacturing process design. The results of the numerical example demonstrates that the methodology offers managers the opportunity to generate and assess alternative manufacturing designs which are otherwise unavailable. The use of the methodology is straightforward in practical situations and should greatly enhance the linkage between marketing and manufacturing design.

Field service support is becoming increasingly important with the rising complexity of the products in many industries. In particular, the field service of communication equipment, manufacturing equipment and computers is a major factor of consumer choice. Managers of field service support systems need models and tools to analyze the impact of strategic decisions on customer service and cost. This paper presents a useful, computationally efficient model to evaluate the impact of many strategic decisions. It provides a strong example of the integrative research which is vital to industries and the practice of management science. Important extensions and other areas of related research are highlighted as well.			WALLER, AAW (corresponding author), AUBURN UNIV,AUBURN,AL 36849, USA.

Thus, it is essential to identify factors which contribute to IJVGM effectiveness. Using data on a sample of 39 IJVs, this study examined the empirical relationship of self-efficacy and outcome expectancy with IJVGM performance. Hypotheses that both self-efficacy and out-come expectancy are significantly related to both IJVGM and IJV performance were supported Theoretical! practical, and methodological implications are discussed.

This will only succeed if local family doctors (general practitioners) take on responsibilities for budgets and as purchasers of specialist services. According to auditing mechanisms the visible discharge of these responsibilities can only be done using computerized management information systems. This paper investigates the effects of rapid expansion of information systems in an organization without clear strategic direction.

Numerical signatures (real numbers) are generated for each node. Role-identical nodes share common numerical signatures. The decomposition of the node set into classes by reference to the numerical signatures helps determine the automorphic equivalence classes of a network. The technique is applicable to symmetric and directed networks, and to graphs with multiple link types. The algorithm is linear with respect to the number of links in the network. Its theoretical foundation exploits properties of transcendental numbers.

It also examines the extent to which models derived from the profit-making sector, specifically those of Michael Porter, are applicable in organizations which are motivated to meet a social need rather than make a profit. The study found that most voluntary organizations are using IT for efficiency improvements, though a few are beginning to apply it to strategic decision making. Porter's five-forces model of industry competition is redefined to illustrate the different situation of the voluntary sector. There is evidence of implicit competition in the sector, not least over funding, but cooperation is on a piecemeal basis and there is little in the way of an IT infrastructure which would facilitate cooperation. The paper concludes with an indication of further research needed.			BOYLE, A (corresponding author), UNIV STRATHCLYDE,DEPT INFORMAT SCI,GLASGOW G1 1XW,SCOTLAND.

J	O'Connor, AD				O'Connor, Anne D.			Successful strategic information systems planning	INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						information systems planning; planning; SISP; strategic information systems planning; strategic planning		Strategic information systems planning (SISP) is the process of ensuring alignment between business plans and objectives and information systems plans and objectives and/or the process of identifying information systems which will provide the organization with a competitive edge. This paper distinguishes SISP from both tactical and operational information systems planning, discusses the reasons for management concern with SISP, summarizes problems which may be encountered with the planning process and resultant plant implementation and then focuses on the issue of SISP success. Specifically, success is considered not only in terms of how it may be achieved but also in terms of how it can be defined (i.e. what constitutes SISP success) and how SISP success can be measured. Specific research questions addressing the measurement of SISP success are identified.

J	UDO, GJ; DAVIS, JS				UDO, GJ; DAVIS, JS			A COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS OF DSS USER-FRIENDLINESS AND EFFECTIVENESS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SUCCESS	Both researchers and practitioners consider usability of decision support systems (DSS) to be the most important feature that an effective DSS should possess. The buzzword 'user-friendly' is so overused by vendors and system designers that it has almost lost its meaning. In this era when DSSs are deployed by organizations towards strategic ends, it makes sense to determine at what price user-friendliness should be obtained. The main purpose of this study was to determine empirically whether user-friendliness is indeed associated with DSS effectiveness. Results from a mail survey of 201 DSS users indicated that user-friendliness has a positive association with decision quality and overall satisfaction, but has no significant relationship with time savings and cost effectiveness. The results also indicate that user-friendliness may hinder productivity. This finding has some implications for DSS designers/developers and researchers. Overall, the findings suggest that while user-friendliness is highly desirable of a DSS, it does not contribute to DSS effectiveness in terms of some of the major measures - time savings, productivity, and overall cost effectiveness.

It explores how the founders of the motion study method affected vocational rehabilitation of the handicapped. This article addresses the ideological paradox faced by the Gilbreths in dealing with handicapped workers and identifies the long-lasting effects of their efforts on governmental policies, employer hiring practices, and new product innovations. Through their efforts, the Gilbreths demonstrated how handicapped workers could become productive members of the community.

J	STILES, CH				STILES, CH			THE INFLUENCE OF SECONDARY PRODUCTION ON INDUSTRY DEFINITION IN THE EXTENDED VERTICAL MARKET MODEL	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						VERTICAL MARKET STRUCTURE; EXTENDED MARKET MODEL; STRUCTURE-PROFIT MODEL; INTERINDUSTRY TRANSACTIONS		Secondary production is defined and its role in the estimation of an extended vertical market model is examined. Two impacts on the subject industry are identified, called primary product dominance and primary product focus. A simultaneous equations model consisting of a profit equation and two secondary production equations is estimated using data from the interindustry transactions accounts. The profit equation captures the impact on industry profit of secondary production and of extended market structure. The dominance equation captures the relationship between secondary production and industry profit and scale of production. The focus equation captures the relationship between secondary production and industry profit and excess capacity. The model is estimated for all industries, and the common specification is then applied to industries grouped by type.

J	ANVARI, M				ANVARI, M			ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE AND INVENTORIES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6TH INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON INVENTORIES	AUG, 1990	BUDAPEST, HUNGARY	INT SOC INVENTORY RES				Several studies have been undertaken to examine the impact of EDI on business corporations from various vantage points. Most of these studies have focused on the impact of EDI as a strategic business tool aimed at creating competitive advantage. However, one of the major findings of these studies has been that the reduction in the level of inventories constitutes a major benefit of EDI systems. The only study to-date on this issue has been a short analysis by Hill et al. (1989). Our study quantifies the impact of EDI on inventories by considering the impact of EDI systems on; (1) reduced lead time, (2) reduced uncertainty during lead time, and (3) reduced ordering cost. We will show, analytically, that as a result of EDI, the total inventory management cost of the firm will be reduced. Furthermore, we will quantify the level of savings as a function of the demand pattern for the ordering firm. Finally, we will examine the connection between EDI and JIT inventory systems and explain how EDI will facilitate the implementation of JIT procedures.

Technology was found to be a more sensitive determinant of uncertainty than organizational size; and the influence of either one or both of these posited determinants of uncertainty was somewhat mixed with regard to the eight factors of strategic choice rated by the respondent CEOs.

J	CORBEY, M				CORBEY, M			MEASURABLE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF INVESTMENTS IN FLEXIBLE CAPACITY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6TH INTERNATIONAL WORKING SEMINAR ON PRODUCTION ECONOMICS	FEB 19-23, 1990	IGLS, AUSTRIA					Investments in flexible capacities are large. It is not surprising that a solid economic infrastructure is a precondition. From the strategic prospective the structural support will rest on qualitative grounds. Yet, the central problem posed in the present article is how the economic consequences of investments in flexible capacities can actually be measured. It is worked out in three steps. To begin with, the Just-In-Time concept is placed in an integral framework of goods-flow control. This is essential because it will be found that, without this analysis, there is a danger that the estimate of the positive effects will be too optimistic. Subsequently, we introduce a concrete production situation. Lastly, for the selected production situation, the concrete economic consequences of a flexible capacity investment will be examined. Our starting point is that the investment will in fact lead to an adjustment of the logistics concept. For that reason, the maximum Just-In-Time advantages can be realised. At the same time the possible misrepresentation resulting from "traditional" costs calculation will be examined.

J	NOORI, H				NOORI, H			THE DECOUPLING OF PRODUCT AND PROCESS LIFE-CYCLES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article								When should a plant, if ever, adopt more flexible forms of production technology? The factors supporting the decision for a dedicated system are often based on the dedicated technology's lower fixed and variable costs with respect to production volumes. In many industries, it is clear that such cost-reduction techniques are essential to a firm's success. On the other hand, flexible manufacturing systems, though initially more expensive, eliminate the requirement for an immediate investment in a new process once the life span of a particular part or product has ended. Given these fundamental differences, it is clear that the question of whether a firm within an industry should select a manufacturing technology which is highly flexible or dedicated can be key to its long-term success. To gain a reasonable understanding of which decision is best, it is imperative that the relationships between innovation, market, and production costs be understood and quantified. The aim of this report is to analyse these vital connections in an attempt to shed further light on these questions. In this context, we introduce the notion of 'fast response process capability' as an alternative to the dynamic model of product and process innovation cycles introduced by Utterback and Abernathy (1975). We argue that this new framework will have a large strategic implication across the industry.

J	YATESMERCER, PA; STEWARD, YF				YATESMERCER, PA; STEWARD, YF			THE MARKETING OF INTERNAL BUSINESS INFORMATION-SERVICES	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article							SPECIAL-LIBRARIES; PRODUCTIVITY; MANAGEMENT; BENEFIT	The approaches to the internal marketing of their services by information departments within companies in the business sector are surveyed. The context includes the political, economic and social changes of the last decade. The notion of marketing and its implementation by information services is first reviewed. The survey itself showed a marked change towards a recognition of the value of marketing information services internally. This change in attitude is shown by a move away from treating marketing as promotion only, towards the use of other elements of the marketing mix: product, price and place. It is seen to be justified by increases in budget, staff, performance and other benefits. However, despite the conversion towards marketing, implementation is generally on a personal, informal basis. This suggests that environmental factors have contributed to the benefits. The study concludes that only with the use of formalised evaluation procedures, linked through a marketing plan to the company's overall strategic objectives, will marketing cease to be equated with promotion and take on its full role as a vital management tool.

Information Needs of Top MIS Managers	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Critical success factors; management of MIS; information requirements		Despite the importance of the role of the Chief MIS Executive, little is known about the "Information Needs of Top MIS Managers." This article uses a Critical Success Factors (CSF) approach to explore the information needs of these managers. It has been widely speculated that top MIS Managers are remiss in their use of the technology they provide to others. This article also reports on a study of the formal information systems used personally by chief MIS executives and contrasts these results with their needs as revealed by the CSF analysis.

Alternative Designs in Information System Development	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						MIS design process; alternative designs; MIS development		The concept of creating and considering alternative designs in the system development process is integral to design methodology in many fields. In MIS the idea is little implemented despite the existence of some techniques that facilitate the consideration of alternative designs. Some of these techniques are reviewed and evaluated in terms of their utility in MIS.

J	McLeod, R; Bender, DH				McLeod, Raymond; Bender, Donald H.			The Integration of Word Processing Into a Management Information System	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Word processing; information theory; management roles; hard information; soft information; Mintzberg; multifunctional work station; action oriented processing; multifunctional management information station		Both the computing and word processing industries have grown to billion dollar size, but little real effort has been made to integrate them at the application level. The effort that has been expended to date has been directed at integrating word processing and data processing. What is needed is a serious look at the potential for integrating word processing into management information systems. One approach is to evaluate theoretical constructs of management information systems that indicate areas of potential word processing applications. Henry Mintzberg's concept of managerial roles and information flows is one such construct. The authors use Mintzberg's theory as a basis for a word processing and management information system integration that is being followed in a life insurance company. The company had recognized the logic of integrating word processing and data processing, but the potential for also involving information processing in the long range plan became clear only after an interpretation of the Mintzberg theory in light of word processing opportunities. The experiences of this company should be of value to others engaged in loosely-tied word processing, data processing, and management information system development programs.

Organization Development Methods in the Management of the Information Systems Function	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Organization development; change management; data center performance		The work presented in this article relates directly to perhaps the most serious problem facing the Information Systems manager in a large, complex organization today, namely how to plan and manage in a rapidly changing, high-demand, resource-limited environment. The article describes an organizational change effort undertaken within a major data processing organization to seek improvements in four broad areas: data center production performance, responsiveness of the systems development activity, management control and decision making, and long range and operational planning processes. Much of the change effort involved activities and tasks which were defined and implemented using Organization Development (OD) methods. OD involves the application of behavioral science knowledge in a collaborative and participative process in response to some perceived need within the organization. It is a planned and systematic way to alter patterns of organizational behavior. The general change strategy utilized is described along with specific examples of particular OD techniques, those which worked well and those which did not. Finally the article presents some observations as to why OD methods are important to Information Systems (IS) managers. OD methods are powerful skills and tools for working change of the most important kind, namely change in organizational and group behavior. As the primary agent for change in the corporation, IS managers can employ these methods to make the IS organization more responsive to the needs of the business. More importantly they can bring these same skills to bear on the larger problem of helping their corporation adjust to change. facilitating and leveraging that change in ways which mere technology cannot accomplish.

BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS FUNCTION	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Information systems; MIS management; MIS planning		The small number of truly successful Information Systems departments is well known. Part of the problem clearly lies in the management and direction of the Information Systems department in an organization. The organizations with successful Information Systems departments appear to have some elements in common. These elements include defining the department's role and responsibilities, structuring its basic approach, establishing management direction, developing a plan, and development of good people. This article describes these common elements in detail, with emphasis on case studies. Alternative means of achieving objectives are described. In summary, a conceptual framework for building an effective Information Systems department is established.

The experiment involved examining whether different ways of reporting a specific standard cost accounting situation resulted in differences in managers' evaluations. When actual costs differed significantly from standard, it was found that the form of the accounting report did have an impact on evaluations. The presentation and the frequency of the report were found to be important variables in MIS design which affected managers' evaluations.
