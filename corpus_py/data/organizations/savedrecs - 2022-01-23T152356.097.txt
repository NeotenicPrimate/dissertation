Health Risks And Safety Management Of Scientific And Research Laboratories' Staff When Working With Nanomaterials	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						powder mixtures of metal nanoparticles; nanoparticles of oxide powders; health indicators; risk groups; operational safety culture	NANOPARTICLES; CULTURES	The human health risks are the core ecological problem within the expanding application of nanomaterials and -technologies. The continuous studies on how nanomaterials affect the human health and safety demonstrate a wide range of hazards, however, there is still a few investigations that show health status dynamics of scientific and research laboratories' staff which is in touch with nanoparticles. There is still a lot of gaps when it comes to the occupational safety in the laboratories that use complex nanopowder mixtures, for which no complete picture of potential risks exists. This problem applies both the ways how to lower adverse effects on employees' health, and to create occupational safety mechanisms, capable to provide appropriate behavioral patterns of employees when working with such nanomaterials. In this regard, the paper sets two complementary objectives: first, to find and prove the relation between the long-term exposure of harmful factors and the probability of investigator's personal injury when working with nanomaterials, and second, to put extensive measures to lower health risks of scientific and research laboratories' employees. A complete physical examination of scientific and research center employees who are always in contact with various mixtures of nano- and ultrafine metal powders (laboratory and instrumental examinations, consultations by medical specialists, employees' interviews). The laboratories' employees were found to have chronic symptoms of rhinitis and pharyngitis, a bronchitis liability, slight alterations on the part of excitatory and cardiovascular system, the evidence of which is a function of labor staff occupancy in the scientific center. Based on employees' morbidity level and analysis of additional health risk factors, a risk matrix was developed to make it possible to identify staff groups by a susceptibility to nanopowders adverse effects (depending on employee chronic decease, age and occupancy), to select tailored preventive measures for lowering the laboratory staff morbidity rate. Moreover, labor safety culture measures are suggested. The study results and suggested measures may be used in the practice of labor safety management in scientific and research laboratories.

The researchers analyzed two Non-Profit Organizations (NGOs) that operate in Libya - Bokra and Attawasul. NGOs like any other organization have publics they need to communicate and appeal to and as such it goes without saying that they channel their communication messages in such a way that their message is clear and resonates soundly with their intended audiences. This is even more pertinent in a country like Libya. Public Relations ensures that organizations are favorably looked upon by their publics by communicating in the right way. This study was premised on the Social Marketing Theory and dealt with understanding Public Relations and how it is used by NGOs in Libya. Based on the findings of this study, it was determined that Public Relations especially through social media, indeed plays a significant role in the process of getting donors and volunteers for NGOs in Libya. To arrive at this conclusion, questionnaires were distributed to staff and volunteers of the organizations under study and interviews were also conducted with top management staff of both organizations.

J	Blackwell, J				Blackwell, Jennifer			Music Program Alumni's Perceptions of Professional Skills, Abilities, and Job Satisfaction: A Secondary Analysis of the 2011, 2012, and 2013 Strategic National Arts Alumni Project (SNAAP) Survey	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MUSIC EDUCATION			English	Article						K-12 teachers; studio teachers; professional preparation; job satisfaction; SNAAP	TEACHERS PERCEPTIONS; OPINIONS; LESSONS; PRESERVICE; BEHAVIORS; ATTITUDES; EDUCATION; STUDENTS	The purpose of this study is to compare music studio teachers' (n = 622) and K-12 music teachers' (n = 976) perceptions of the extent to which their postsecondary education helped them develop selected professional skills and abilities, perceptions of how important those same selected skills and abilities are for teaching, and job satisfaction. Data are from the 2011, 2012, and 2013 administrations of the Strategic National Arts Alumni Project survey. Respondents indicated the following skills were very important to their work: relationship building (Studio: 81.3%; K-12: 75.7%), leadership skills (Studio: 71.6%; K-12: 89.3%), project management (Studio: 65.1%; K-12: 74.8%), persuasive speaking (Studio: 63.4%; K-12: 74.2%), clear writing (Studio: 51.5%; K-12: 63.4%), creative thinking (Studio: 88.7%; K-12: 91.4%), taking feedback (Studio: 78.8%; K-12: 81.2%), broad knowledge and education (Studio: 80.1%; K-12: 91.0%), and critical thinking (Studio: 64.3%; K-12: 76.4%). Fewer than 50% of respondents felt their institutions had helped them develop project management, persuasive speaking, clear writing, and critical thinking skills. The most substantial differences were financial, business, and entrepreneurial skills, indicating that studio teachers perceive these skills as important to their work. Studio teachers were less satisfied with job security but more satisfied with work-life balance than K-12 teachers.

He complained of the left shoulder and chest pain after regaining consciousness. On arrival, he showed left bloody otorrhea, left chest tenderness, and a limited range of motion due to the left shoulder pain. Emergency chest roentgenography revealed multiple left rib fractures, left clavicular fracture with decreased radiolucency in the left lung field, suggesting lung contusion. When the patient was being transported for computed tomography, he suddenly displayed ventricular tachycardia with pulse and subsequently became VF storm, which required percutaneous cardiopulmonary support. The coronary angiogram showed complete obstruction of the branch of the anterior descending artery. Coronary angioplasty resulted in recanalization; however, massive hemorrhage from the left ear was recognized. Computed tomography revealed traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and left massive hemothorax requiring thoracostomy. Massive hemorrhage from the left ear and left thoracic cavity continued alter the patient was transported to the coronary care unit. He underwent massive transfusion; however, he died on the same day.

The dynamics of telecommunication law has provided a clear direction, from monopoly to healthy competition. It is important for foreign investment to be an option that needs to be harmonized with the applicable law of telecommunication. Four main constructs have been identified as important issues to be discussed are Social Welfare (SW); Global Village (GV); Foreign Direct Investiment (FDI); and Law Telecomunication (LT). In conclusion, two quality actions are proposed to accelerate fair accesibility through law of telecommunication in global village setting. The first quality action is to accelerate SW through fair accessibility in GV setting and FDI. The second quality action is to accelerate SW through fair accessibility based on FDI and LT.

J	Rafati, L; Poels, G				Rafati, Laleh; Poels, Geert			Service-Oriented Enterprise Engineering: A Modeling Discipline Based on the Viable Systems Approach (vSa) for Strategic Sourcing Decision-Making	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE SERVICE SECTOR			English	Article						Service-Dominant Logic; Service-Oriented Enterprise Engineering; Strategic Sourcing Decision-Making; Value-Driven Strategic Sourcing; Viable Systems Approach	SCIENCE	Strategic sourcing, as a critical area of strategic management, is centered on decision-making towards achieving value-driven targets. Many companies face challenges in obtaining the benefits associated with effective strategic sourcing decision-making. Enterprise modeling can contribute to strategic sourcing decision-making by helping in the conceptualization, design and exploration of multiple strategic options for better decision-making. In this article, the authors explore a solution approach that refines the existing Enterprise Engineering (EE) modeling discipline into a Service-oriented Enterprise Engineering (SoEE) modeling discipline, by founding it on the novel application of the Viable Systems Approach (vSa) towards strategic (sourcing) decision-making. The proposed modeling discipline provides (1) the systemic viewpoints to interpret complex sourcing phenomena; and (2) the outside-box models to specify the value-driven interactions of an enterprise (as a system) with other actors. Finally, to operationalize the modeling discipline the authors introduce the conceptual basis (C.A.R.S) of a modeling language to apply the SoEE viewpoints and develop the related models for supporting strategic sourcing decision-making. The paper elaborates on preliminary ideas presented at the SoEA4EE 2013 workshop.

This study evaluated the role of prior technical experiences in developing firm's absorptive capacity and the contribution of this type of capacity to the firm's innovation performance. In this study we designed a questionnaire to assess firms' KAC and innovation performance. First, the validity and reliability of the questionnaire were assessed. The data were collected from owners/managing directors or research and development managers of 20 Iranian pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies. The following variables were measured: industrial and technical experiences of owners/managing directors and the members of research and development teams, KAC, innovation performance indices and control variables. The questionnaire had appropriate validity and reliability. The findings indicated that the breadth and the depth of the owner's/managing director's industrial experiences properly reflected KAC of a pharmaceutical company. In turn, the present research showed that the absorptive capacity of a firm could affect its innovation performance. Organizational strategic regeneration and innovation depends on two critical sources: learning at the organizational and individual levels. KAC plays a critical role in pharmaceutical company's innovation outputs.

The present paper aims at investigating the organizational variables affecting the health system integration in Iran. This is an applied cross-sectional exploratory study. Successful patterns of integration in the health system were extracted and studied through literature review. Then, different dimensions of these models were compared in a comparative matrix. A questionnaire was designed and filled by experts. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to determine the effective factors and the model fit was examined through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The effect of organizational factor on the integration of the health system was estimated to be 0.93. Based on exploratory factor analysis (EFA), "learning organization" with factor load of 0.691 and based on the confirmatory factor analysis the "Interest Management" with factor load of 0.81 have the highest importance in the health care integration in Iran. The health system can be successful through the establishment of supportive policies, the development of the contract and the strategic alliance between the organizations and by increasing the coordination of care and information and increasing the collective learning ability in the organization.

The alignment involves an entire organisation. However, much of the research has focused on the factors affecting alignment at the senior executive level, and there appears to be less attention placed upon factors that affect the lower operational levels. This article attempts to address this gap in the literature through a case study of a healthcare organisation. Semi-structured interviews with ten employees at an operational level were qualitatively analysed to elucidate factors. Organisational culture, management expectations, communication, and the provision and recognition of skills were identified as main factors that may affect the alignment of business and IT strategies at the lower levels	[Vatharkar, Sid] Vodafone UK, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Gao, Ping] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Fomin, Vladislav] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Dept Appl Informat, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Fomin, Vladislav] Turiba Univ, Riga, Latvia		Vatharkar, S (corresponding author), Vodafone UK, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.

Customers can increase the quality of connections by multihoming, i.e. using subscriptions of several operators. Multihoming is facilitated by an innovative reprogrammable embedded SIM (eSIM) that can enable dynamic switching between networks. Although eSIM multihoming is advantageous, its future is not definite, as it is affected by multiple factors and actors with conflicting business interests. This paper defines scenarios for the evolution of eSIM multihoming and its possible impact on competition by constructing qualitative system dynamics models based on expert interviews. The results show that depending on market conditions and actions of stakeholders, multihoming may reach high diffusion, find application in special use cases, or fail to take off. With high diffusion, competition between operators will become more dynamic, and market share will be defined by the number of served sessions.

The Strategic Value of Big Data Analytics in Health Care Policy-Making	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Affordable Care Act; Big Data Analytics; Ecological Rationality; Hospital Readmission Reduction Program; Rational Choice Theory	HOSPITAL READMISSION; 30-DAY READMISSIONS; REDUCTION PROGRAM; QUALITY; CHALLENGES; LENGTH; STAY; RISK; ACT	This article describes how the metrics that are used to gauge acceptable versus inadequate care have spurred debates among health care administrators and scholars. Specifically, they argue that the use of readmissions as a quality-of-care metric may reduce patients' safety. Consequently, the new well-intended policies may prove ineffective, or even worse, yield disappointing results. While the discussions over the advantages and disadvantages of the new policies are based more on conjectures rather than on evidence, analytics provides a vehicle to measure the effectiveness of such overarching strategies. In this effort, the authors analyze large volumes of hospital encounters data before and after the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to show how overlooking some aspects of a problem may lead to unexpected outcomes. The authors conclude that the feedback provided by big data analytics can be used by the government and organization policymakers to obtain a better understanding of loopholes and to propose more effective policies in prospective endeavors.

At the same time, this economic view is understood as determining in setting of strategic objectives and formulating perspectives of a region. In this article there are outlined bases for a more complex and systematic multidimensional approach to the issue of strategic marketing management in the Spis region also in the context of current social and economic development of Europe and its surroundings. A system element of strategic management of a region must also be the ethic dimension, culture, history and preferred values or other qualitative factors of people. Only such an approach, which will take into consideration a wide spectrum of relevant system elements, can create a, made-to-measure. control system for a monitored region. Proven Christian values, embodied also in sacral buildings in towns and villages of the region, may be a significant factor of development of tourism in one of the oldest historical regions of Slovakia. The objective of the article is to develop a research model for preparation and usage of sacral cultural monuments in tourism and an educational activity in the Spis region and justification of this potential for perspective development of the region. The study also offers a review of the main results of sociological research aimed at perception of cultural and spiritual values in the surveyed region.

Heightened attention to safety management and public concern about possible threats and perception of risk has now become a fundamental component of the planning and risk management strategies for sports events. To deal with this issue, this study aims to systemize and develop the strategic planning process for security operations of the gaming facilities and to the public in general within the games perimeter, during the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We took basis on MCDA-C (Multi-Criteria Methodology Decision Support - Constructivist), to develop a system capable of promoting the institutional integration of Brazilian security forces to ensure the public and playing field's safety, as well as the games perimeter and public and private property used for the 2016 Olympic Games. The system starts with a business environment analysis, and service requirements analyzes, and, with the MCDA-C's assistance, a relevance matrix was constructed, and, from it, resources and operations plans were set.

J	Hermel, D; Mantin, B				Hermel, Dror; Mantin, Benny			Selling to strategic consumers: on the benefits of consumers' valuation uncertainty and abundant inventory	JOURNAL OF REVENUE AND PRICING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						revenue management; strategic consumers; dynamic pricing	INFORMATION; BEHAVIOR	We consider a profit-maximizing seller who encounters consumers over two periods. The consumers face valuation uncertainty in the first period, which is resolved in the second period. We show that when the seller is capacity constrained, then there is a threshold capacity above which the seller prefers facing strategic, rather than myopic, consumers. Accounting for the seller's stocking decisions, we find that the seller may stock higher levels of inventory when faced with strategic consumers than when faced with myopic consumers.

J	Song, LL				Song, Lili			Forced migration of ethnic Kachins from Myanmar to China: Law and politics behind China's response	ASIAN AND PACIFIC MIGRATION JOURNAL			English	Article						ethnic Kachin; forced migration; refugee protection; Myanmar; China	BURMA	This article examines China's response to the influxes of ethnic Kachins displaced by armed conflict from Myanmar and discusses the probable legal and policy considerations underlying China's response. It is based on the existing literature as well as fieldwork in Yunnan Province, China and Kachin State, Myanmar. Since June 2011, more than 10,000 displaced Kachins have entered into Yunnan. China has provided little assistance to them and forcibly repatriated about 5,000 of them in August and September 2012. Although displaced Kachins in Yunnan qualify prima facie for refugee status under the Refugee Convention and Protocol, China refuses to recognize them as refugees and primarily relies on the 1997 Chinese-Myanmar Border Management Agreement and the 1990 Yunnan Rules to handle them. China's concerns about domestic stability and desire to protect its political, strategic and economic interests in Myanmar arguably have contributed to China's policy toward displaced Kachins.

The new media force the police to update its crowd control strategy. The police's scope of concern reaches an unprecedented level of exchange, because of the digital dimension adding to the physical one; it now has to take both into account in its crowd management practices. What is the attitude adopted by the Service de police de la Ville de Montreal (SPVM) with regard to the social media? What use does it make of the Twitter microblogging platform during demonstrations? In order to understand how the law enforcement agency uses the potential of this media and how it impacts its communications and practices, a database of 3,909 Twitter messages, dated between September 2012 and June 2015, was created. An analysis of the database shows that the SPVM seeks to establish a direct and egalitarian dialogue with the public, tries to open a specific communication channel with protesters and uses this new medium as a strategic tool.

The current study aims to compare prevention and control programs of viral hepatitis in Egypt, Georgia, Pakistan and Australia. This is an international comparative analysis study, which by using document review, Australia, Egypt, Pakistan and Georgia was purposely selected. Then, their national programs in prevention, screening and treatment were compared. For data analysis, the narrative review methodology was used. Hepatitis C and B prevalence in Pakistan was 5 and 2.5%, respectively. Injecting drug use was the main transmission way. Among investigated programs, Gerogia was only focused on hepatitis C, although hepatitis B prevalence was 2.9%. In Australia, Strategic program for screening and diagnosis was mainly focused on priority populations, such as those who inject drugs, those who are cultrally and linguistically different. To achieve viral hepatitis elimination, countries must focus on its prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

Internationally accepted frameworks for IT management and / or governance are indicative of establishing good IT governance. However, the real use of these tools is still scarce, causing companies to lose competitiveness. The present study evaluated the use of internationally recognized management and / or IT governance frameworks in Brazilian Northeastern companies, identifying the reasons why these frameworks are not used. The research was carried out in two stages, the first using a directioned questionnaire and the second from semi-structured interviews. The results point out that the distance between management and IT, the organizational culture, the low qualification of IT professionals and the lack of qualification of the company managers in relation to the frameworks, are factors of non-use.

In every period until its discovery, the players decide how much of the unsearched area to comb. If a player finds the prize alone he wins it and the game ends. Players have a per-period discount factor and costs proportional to the area they search. First, as a benchmark for efficiency, we solve the one-player search problem. Second, in the two-player setting we show that typically there is inefficient over-search - a result akin to the tragedy of the commons. However, for players with intermediate levels of patience, there is the possibility of inefficient under-search as players incorporate the expected future payoffs in their current search decisions. Finally, with patient players, several counterintuitive results can arise: for example, players might be better off searching a larger island or looking for a less valuable prize.

However, since LHC does not contain much aluminum, it is difficult for LHC to immobilize chloride ions and be used in salt damage environments such as seashore. CaO center dot 2Al(2)O(3) addition to LHC can be the countermeasure, however chloride immobilization in LHC with CaO center dot 2Al(2)O(3) has not been researched in detail. This paper describes the influence of CaCl2 addition on hydration of LHC containing an expansive additive and CaO center dot 2Al(2)O(3). In LHC containing an expansive additive, ettringite was mainly generated with and without CaCl2. In contrast, in LHC containing an expansive additive and CaO center dot 2Al(2)O(3), monosulfate was generated without CaCl2, and Friedel's salt were generated with CaCl2. Therefore, LHC containing an expansive additive and CaO center dot 2Al(2)O(3) showed potential for chloride ion immobilization. (C) 2018 The Ceramic Society of Japan. All rights reserved.

Effect of crop establishment practices on the performance of component cultivars under pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) - wheat (Triticum aestivum) cropping system in IGP	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Economics; Nutrient harvest index; Pigeonpea-Wheat; Raised-bed; Ridge-furrow; System productivity	PHOSPHORUS MANAGEMENT; GANGETIC PLAINS; PRODUCTIVITY; INDIA	Pigeonpea-wheat rotation is emerging as a potential alternative to existing rice-wheat system of Indo-Gangetic plains because of many inherent constraints right from requirements of higher inputs to deterioration in soil health in the latter. Realizing the importance of pigeonpea-wheat cropping system, the present study was conducted to evaluate diverse crop establishment practices [ridge pigeonpea followed by flatbed wheat (RP-FBW); raised-bed pigeonpea followed by raised-bed wheat (RBP-RBW)] in combination with three cultivars of pigeonpea (UPAS 120, ICP 67B, and Pusa 992), and two wheat cultivars (Shatabdi, Unnat Halna). Two-year study revealed that raised-bed practice of crop establishment resulted in 11.7% higher grain yield of pigeonpea as compared to ridge planting. Although the advantage of raised-bed was not apparent in wheat as 13.9% higher grain yield was recorded under flatbed over raised-bed establishment method. Based on pigeonpea equivalent yield and production economics, RP-FBW was found superior over RBP-RBW. However, the performance of component crops suggested that raised-bed for pigeonpea and flatbed for wheat could be the strategic crop establishment under pigeonpea-wheat rotation. Plant nutrient utilization as expressed by nutrient harvest index, physiological efficiency and utilization efficiency differed substantially within the cultivars of pigeonpea and wheat crop; and the preceding pigeonpea cultivars significantly influenced the nutrient acquisition in the successive wheat crop. Among the different cultivars, UPAS 120 pigeonpea followed by Unnat Halna wheat had far better response measured through the highest pigeonpea equivalent yield (2.71 t/ha), net return ((sic) 69,331), and benefit: cost ratio (2.02). Thus, the study suggested that strategic cultivar selection and appropriate crop establishment method could be the key to maximize output from the pigeonpea-wheat system in IGP.

J	Yamasaki, C; Henry, M; Nagai, K; Matsumoto, K; Yokota, H				Yamasaki, Chika; Henry, Michael; Nagai, Kohei; Matsumoto, Koji; Yokota, Hiroshi			Internal Knowledge Sharing by Infrastructure Maintenance Engineers in Small and Medium Size Construction Companies in Japan	ENGINEERING JOURNAL-THAILAND			English	Article						Infrastructure; maintenance management; sharing knowledge; knowledge management		It is necessary to increase the capability of engineers to carry out maintenance management for keeping infrastructure safe and serviceable. Many regional training programs have been established to develop engineers into "maintenance experts." While small and medium size construction companies and engineering consultants play an active role in infrastructure maintenance, they have limited human and economic resources for joining the training programs, so the sharing of knowledge acquired from the programs becomes important for improving the capability of the company as a whole. The objective of this research is to investigate how engineers who participated in regional training programs shared their knowledge inside their organization using an online questionnaire survey. It was found that leadership is an important factor for driving knowledge sharing activities, particularly for adapting the knowledge acquired from the training program to the company's environment. However, the lack of experience serves as a barrier to the deeper transfer of knowledge, such as on-the-job training or seminars, as these methods of knowledge sharing require expert knowledge. For organizations to improve their knowledge sharing practices, it is necessary to consider the type of knowledge to be shared and the appropriate method for sharing, along with the improvement of the leadership for knowledge sharing in the organization.

However, literature on empirical studies has devoted relatively little attention to this topic. The purpose of the present work is to identify PSS customer requirements by analyzing empirical studies. Toward this goal, we present here a structured systematic literature review. This study systematically reviews 269 articles published until 2015 in the PSS field. About 10% of the publications reviewed describe empirical studies that identify PSS-customer requirements. After analyzing the content of these articles, we identify 37 requirements clustered around three criteria: (i) type of PSS, (ii) type of business transaction, and (iii) customer requirements that relate to product, service, or general aspects of PSS. The empirical studies investigated in this literature review focused on the business-tobusiness context. This study support PSS provider meet customer requirements. Then, they will be more successful in offering the PSS.

J	Gulati, N; Garg, A				Gulati, Neha; Garg, Atul			A Secured Cognitive Agent based Multi-strategic Intelligent Search System	JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						BDI model; Cognitive Agent; Emotion; Information retrieval; Intelligent search; Search Engine	WEB	Search Engine (SE) is the most preferred information retrieval tool ubiquitously used. In spite of vast scale involvement of users in SE's, their limited capabilities to understand the user/searcher context and emotions places high cognitive, perceptual and learning load on the user to maintain the search momentum. In this regard, the present work discusses a Cognitive Agent (CA) based approach to support the user in Web-based search process. The work suggests a framework called Secured Cognitive Agent based Multi-strategic Intelligent Search System (CAbMsISS) to assist the user in search process. It helps to reduce the contextual and emotional mismatch between the SE's and user. After implementation of the proposed framework, performance analysis shows that CAbMsISS framework improves Query Retrieval Time (QRT) and effectiveness for retrieving relevant results as compared to Present Search Engine (PSE). Supplementary to this, it also provides search suggestions when user accesses a resource previously tagged with negative emotions. Overall, the goal of the system is to enhance the search experience for keeping the user motivated. The framework provides suggestions through the search log that tracks the queries searched, resources accessed and emotions experienced during the search. The implemented framework also considers user security. (C) 2016 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

Incorporation of the socio-cultural dimension into strategic long-term planning of mineral assets in South Africa	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Platinum Conference on Platinum - A Changing Industry in Association with AMI Precious Metals Conference	OCT 18-19, 2017	Polokwane, SOUTH AFRICA			strategic planning; socio-cultural issues; impact management		Extraction of minerals and metals has had, and continues to have, material impacts on society. These impacts can be positive, enabling technological innovation and stimulating economic development, as well as negative, such as environmental and social impacts. The inability to effectively manage these impacts throughout the life of mine (LoM) plan can trigger socio-cultural risks. In fact EY (formerly Ernst & Young) have ranked the social licence to operate as one of the top five risks to the mining sector globally since 2008 (EYGM, 2016). Strategic long-term planning for mineral assets enables delivery of an optimized, strategically aligned business plan from a mineral asset portfolio using a set of tools and techniques with a common language, standards, systems, and processes to align decisions and actions on a cyclical basis. The framework provides the basis for effective management of large, diverse, and complex mineral asset portfolios while creating shared understanding and a common language. It is an approach that acknowledges the nature of the depleting mineral asset base, the importance of a defined but flexible project pipeline, variability in market conditions, and the requirements of the operating legislative environment. However, effective integration of social and environmental considerations into strategic and project planning still remains a challenge for the industry, where social performance considerations manifest predominantly as constraints rather than as optimization objectives. This paper considers the inherent opportunities and challenges in the effective integration of social performance issues into strategic long-term planning for mineral assets in South Africa. It also sets out Anglo American's approach to integrating socio-cultural issues into LoM and resource development planning (RDP) to ensure that operations are able to secure and maintain an effective social license to operate (SLTO) as well as deliver a lasting positive contribution to local communities.

J	Quispe, JET; Escobar-Mamani, F				Tumi Quispe, Jesus E.; Escobar-Mamani, Fortunato			Incidence of social and political factors in the ambient environment of the Puno-Peru Regional Government	REVISTA INVESTIGACIONES ALTOANDINAS-JOURNAL OF HIGH ANDEAN RESEARCH			Spanish	Article						Public management; regional government; investment; institutionality and environmental agenda		The study analyzed the social and political factors that affect the prioritization of environmental investment in the management of the regional government of Puno. The research design was non-experimental, transversal, documentary and quantitative of a descriptive nature; the unit of analysis was made up of the leaders of civil society organizations and the authorities and officials of the regional government. The operational population, determined at random, considering the 95% degree of confidence and margin of error of 0.05, was 160 executives from civil society. The data collection, in the core, was carried out through a survey applied in the year 2017, whose processing and systematization was in the statistical software SPSS. The results induce that the investment in the environmental agenda in the regional public management of Puno is conditioned by the articulation of the strategic and programmatic orientations established by the concerted regional development plan (PDRC) and the environmental institutionality that assign it a substantial priority in environmental investment; With the initiatives and demands of local authorities and civil society organizations and the political will of regional authorities, given its pragmatic perspective and shortterm vision, investment in strategic environmental projects is minimal and not significant, which is evident in the process of formulation and implementation of the participatory budget.

Automating Model Builds for Sequence Optimization of Flood Mitigation Investment Phases	JOURNAL OF WATER MANAGEMENT MODELING			English	Article								A process and a set of tools are proposed to automate the creation of an exhaustive set of flood mitigation scenarios modeled by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Stormwater Management Model (SWMM), as well as to create a strategic planning framework that takes advantage of the exhaustive model scope. Using the proposed method, models are generated for each logical combination of independent flood mitigation alternatives at each possible phase of implementation (i.e. at every practical phase of investment). Cost estimates and flood risk reduction values are calculated for each flood mitigation alternative and organized into all possible sequences of implementation. The exhaustive set of progressive implementation scenarios is then used as a decision-making tool to provide flexibility in long term planning. Because each phase of investment can be implemented and function independently, large capital improvement programs can be constructed progressively without having to commit (politically and financially) to the cost of full implementation of the program. With the proposed process and the data produced, it is shown that strategic planning can be adaptive and may be adjusted to favour short term cost effectiveness, or optimized within a long term budget while being able to end investment at any phase in the program.

Taking into account the specifics of a company activity, employers use different approaches and communication tools for the development and the promotion of an employer brand. An organization image as an employer determines a positive or a negative attitude of potential and already active employees, and plays an important role in their involvement and motivation. The concept of "Employer's value proposition" was studied, the content analysis was conducted, the author's understanding of this term was offered. The essence of internal and external HR-brand is revealed as a strategic asset. Personnel processes have been determined that influence an employer's internal brand. The model of an employer's brand development is proposed. The model is cyclical one and allows to improve an employer's brand gradually using the stages of employer's brand evaluation, comparison, improvement, promotion and control. They performed the research of preferences among doctors, junior and middle medical personnel on the importance of company value proposition components, the knowledge of which will allow companies to increase their value in this segment and improve the areas of activity with potential and working employees. They clarified the direction of an employer's brand for medical organizations in the matter of recruitment and identified the features. They developed the questionnaire "Employer's internal brand" to analyze the employer's brand of medical companies in Primorsky Krai. They studied the specificity of personnel management employed in the provision of medical services. The peculiarities of the employers' market were revealed in the medical sphere of Primorsky Krai.

J	Bilinska-Reformat, K; Stanczyk, I				Bilinska-Reformat, Katarzyna; Stanczyk, Izabela			Employer Branding as a Source of Competitive Advantage of Retail Chains	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION-CENTRAL EUROPE			English	Article						retail; employer brand; labour market		Purpose: Developing a strong, favourable employer brand of a retail chain may be regarded as an important means of creating a competitive advantage. Retail chains should attract personnel with desired competence required for their particular purposes. The retail sector in Poland is perceived as a strongly disliked employer. Thus employer branding can be an important element of strategies adopted by retail chains operating in Poland. The main objective of this paper is to analyse the development of employer branding strategies implemented by selected global retailers operating in Poland and the impact of such strategies on their respective competitive positions in the Polish market. The time frame for the analysis is the period of 2009 2014. Research design and methods: In addition to a review of the literature on the development of employer brands, this paper includes a case study of a few global retail chains operating in Poland. The paper is based on the assumption that retail chains pursue competitive advantage by developing employer brand strategies. Implications and recommendations: A continued engagement in strategic activities in the field of employer branding is very important for retail chains. Decision makers need to pay special attention to the promotion of their retail chains as a good workplace, using employer branding techniques.

Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) are environmental management tools that can greatly benefit the planning process of sustainable urban spaces. This paper presents the contribution of SEA and ESIA to the environmental management of a new city in Mozambique, south of the Capital, Maputo, in the Katembe District. Katembe City's environmental impact assessment process highlighted the particularities of this territory and identified the critical constraints for urban development and the requirements for minimization and monitorization of adverse impacts. The assessment process was developed sequentially, from a regional level to a local urban section level. In the preliminary assessment, major potential negative impacts were avoided and specific environmental and social detailed studies were defined, to be addressed in detailed urban plans. Following this, the detailed plans included all the necessary environmental requirements to avoid and mitigate several negative impacts, such as flooding, coastal erosion, biodiversity loss and habitat fragmentation. This case study emphasized the importance of SEA and ESIA in the planning process of the new city, resulting in a more sound and sustainable urban project.

When using zHyperLink, the IBM z14 processor, along with the DS8880 Storage System (IBM's latest enterprise-class storage for mainframe attachment), delivers up to a 90% reduction in storage I/O service times compared with fiber channel transport technology. zHyperLink I/O service times eliminate the need for an operating system task switch for most read I/O operations, fundamentally improving application response times and changing system scaling behavior. Initial use of zHyperLink on IBM Z, IBM DS8880 storage, and z/OS accelerates the Db2 for z/OS relational database transaction processing information management system hierarchal database and reduces the elapsed time for Virtual Storage Access Method applications. These improvements occur without any application changes. In this paper, we explain the strategic importance of a low-latency I/O capability for the SAN and describe the z14 architecture, hardware, firmware, and software implementation concepts and the preliminary performance results for Db2.

In the next decade, this trend will not only persist, but also increase its dynamics, primarily due to the increasing frequency of multifactorial global crises in power engineering. Consideration of all factors, including natural and climatic ones, will ensure the energy security of the region. In this study, we focus on climate change as one of the main threats to the development of renewable power engineering in Kazakhstan. Power engineering is a strategic branch of Kazakhstan's economy, the foundation of the functioning of all economic spheres and the population, which generates a considerable share of the budgetary revenue of the country. Energy source shortage in rural areas is a serious disadvantage for the development of the economy. This necessitates the development of bio- and geothermal power engineering, with a view to supplying enough power to the rural areas of the South Kazakhstan Region of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

The Attracting of Foreign Investment in the Russian Economic Development	TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH			English	Article						Investment; foreign economic activity; protection of the national economy; attraction of foreign resources; the development of the national economy		The attracting of foreign investment is a strategic goal of the Russian economy's development. Direct investment plays a special role in this process providing an access to financial resources, modern technologies, management skills, innovative goods and services as well as contributing to increase of economic competitiveness, sustained growth and improvements in living standards. In this connection, creation of an enabling environment for foreign investors is a priority sector of public investment policy. Based on the analysis of federal and regional forms of supporting investment activities, it can be concluded that the forms associated with budget injections into the economy are dominant. Co-financing of investment projects, government programs to support exports, create infrastructure (technology parks, SEZ infrastructure, TAD), create support centers for entrepreneurs, all this can be called financial stimulation of economic activity and, in particular, investment activity. The study suggest that the state has to go to these costs in connection with the reduction of the investment potential of the private sector, as a result of the economic crisis and international sanctions.

J	Israelov, R; Tummala, H				Israelov, Roni; Tummala, Harsha			An Alternative Option to Portfolio Rebalancing	JOURNAL OF DERIVATIVES			English	Article								We explore the use of an option selling overlay to improve portfolio rebalancing. Within a multiasset class portfolio, portfolio weights deviate from targets as asset values fluctuate. Investors typically use a rebalancing process to bring portfolio weights back to their desired strategic allocations. However, between rebalances, investors are exposed to unintentional timing bets as weights deviate from targets. These timing bets introduce basis risk to their policy portfolio. A short option overlay can assist with hedging this unintentional exposure. We solve for the overlay construction that provides the desired rebalancing trade upon option expiration and back test an illustrative overlay. Our analysis shows significant reduction in the portfolio's uncompensated timing exposure. Furthermore, by selling options, the overlay earns the volatility risk premium and thereby adds alpha to the portfolio. Lastly, we show that an option overlay for rebalancing is implementable even when considering transaction costs and real-world constraints.

However, in 2011, the companies parted ways based on two main conditions. First, SSC would continue to buy shoes worth at least PKR 3.8 billion from SIL till 2021. Second, SIL would give exclusive license to SSC to use Servis brand for the shoe business till 2021. Omar Saeed, CEO of SIL, is reflecting on the previous four years' performance for the shoe business division. It has not met the sales target for 2014, domestic sales are dependant on SSC and Klara (SIL's own brand of wholesale), the European market is presurizing SIL to reduce prices as well as provide high variety and low volume orders, and more efforts need to be made to utilize SIL's manufacturing facilities. Omar has to make SIL's strategy for 2021, when SSC may not be there to give business worth PKR 3.8 billion, as well as plan the necessary roadmap. SIL's top management wants to see SIL as a global player in its line of business.	[Jajja, M.

Distributed methods can also integrate well with centralised control paradigms if they provide high-level usage statistics and control interfaces for supporting and deploying centralised policy decisions. We present a general method to compute target values for an arbitrary metric on the local system state and show that autonomous rebalancing actions based on the target values can be used to reliably and robustly improve the balance for metrics based on probabilistic risk estimates. To balance the trade-off between balancing efficiency and cost, we introduce 2 methods of deriving rebalancing actuations from the computed targets that depend on parameters that directly affects the trade-off. This enables policy level control of the distributed mechanism based on collected metric statistics from network elements. Evaluation results based on cellular radio access network simulations indicate that load balancing based on probabilistic overload risk metrics provides more robust balancing solutions with fewer handovers compared to a baseline setting based on average load.

The research question pursued in this article is: How do unforeseen events shape managerial strategising?' The theoretical background for this article is inspired by research done within the strategy-as-practice and strategy-in-practice communities and uses concepts such as strategic intent, wayfinding/wayfaring and temporal work to explore how the managers from the small Danish Software Company cooperated with actors in the mining industry. This cooperation was initially perceived as an unforeseen event but, incrementally and retrospectively, it became strategic. The main theoretical and practice-anchored findings draw attention to the roles that unforeseen events can play in shaping strategising. These findings underline the significance of prioritising micro-founded actions carried out contextually by strategists when learning more about the who, what and how of strategising.

In the car rims retail sector in Jakarta, business alliances have lasted for 24 years. The success and sustainability of this alliance offers a valuable lesson for other alliances. This study aims to explain the importance of forming strategic alliances; the effectiveness of strategic alliances with respect for inventory, price, quality, and delivery; the benefits of alliances; and the future expectation of strategic alliances. We conducted semi-structured interviews on 14 companies which have formed strategic alliances and analysed the data using descriptive statistics. The study uses s secondary data as complementary information in the form of documents and appropriate records on the performance of strategic alliance in the car rims retail business. It was found that strategic alliance matches the framework of a resource-based view and social media networks.

J	Lin, Y; Colbert, F				Lin, Yi; Colbert, Francois			Chinese Opera and the International Market	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic analysis; international market; audience segmentation; Chinese opera	ARTS; GENDER	In 1983 Elizabeth C. Hirschman published what was to become a classic work on marketing strategies for aesthetic and ideological products. She constructed three circles, with the public in the outer circle, peers and industrial professionals in the middle circle, and artists in the inner circle. She stated that artists may hope or want to reach one or another of the three segments, or even all three at once. In 1994, based on Hirschman's three-segment theory, Francois Colbert proposed that the product-centred marketing process is distinct from the traditional market-centred process of finding consumers who are likely to appreciate the product. Both Hirschman and Colbert offer a conceptual basis for analyzing the arts market. This article reports on a strategic analysis of the international market for Chinese opera based on experimental data. It extends Hirschman's analysis in several ways: (1) it introduces a quantitative element to support her three-circle classification; (2) it reveals the interactive relationship among the three circles; and (3) it builds a potential strategic system for the development of an international market for Chinese opera. The article also offers insights into the Chinese government's policies on the export of traditional art.

ARCHITECTURE OF DEVELOPMENT PROCESS MODEL FOR FINANCIAL AND INVESTMENT STRATEGY OF INDUSTRY ENTERPRISE STRUCTURES	TURKISH ONLINE JOURNAL OF DESIGN ART AND COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Architecture; development process model; industry enterprise structures		The investments in fixed assets are the most important means of escape provision from the economic crisis and the technical re-equipment of enterprises. The intensification of Russian business structure investment activities as one of the main stabilization and development trends of the domestic economic system requires a comprehensive financial support for the strategic development of their investment activities. The purpose of the article is to substantiate the methodological approach to the to financial and investment strategy development of Russian business structures. In order to achieve the stated goal, the following research methods were used; theoretical analysis and generalization, induction and deduction, analysis and synthesis. The algorithm for financial and investment strategy of entrepreneurial structures in industry has been developed, which makes it possible to improve the quality of real investment financing. According to the article, the financial and investment strategy is as a formalized system element of the overall strategy of an enterprise, comprehensively characterizing the target orientation of the planned investment activity, taking into account the diversification of financing source structure and the evaluation of financial resource use efficiency. It was revealed that the development and the implementation of the financial and investment strategy within the financial management of an enterprise should be viewed as the process of investment project and financial resource management in the context of current activities. It is argued that the content of the financial and investment strategy can also be viewed as a theoretical reflection of interrelated set of functions of enterprise finance and investment process finance in the goal-oriented implementation of investment projects within the framework of strategic financial management. The scientific novelty of the research consists in the development of theoretical and methodological provisions, in the development of financial and investment strategy to justify the trends of investment in business structures, the choice of the methods and the sources of their financial support to improve the quality of industrial modernization financing as the basis for Russian economy development.

The intensification of Russian business structure investment activities as one of the main stabilization and development trends of the domestic economic system requires a comprehensive financial support for the strategic development of their investment activities. The purpose of the article is to substantiate the methodological approach to the to financial and investment strategy development of Russian business structures. In order to achieve the stated goal, the following research methods were used; theoretical analysis and generalization, induction and deduction, analysis and synthesis. The algorithm for financial and investment strategy of entrepreneurial structures in industry has been developed, which makes it possible to improve the quality of real investment financing. According to the article, the financial and investment strategy is as a formalized system element of the overall strategy of an enterprise, comprehensively characterizing the target orientation of the planned investment activity, taking into account the diversification of financing source structure and the evaluation of financial resource use efficiency. It was revealed that the development and the implementation of the financial and investment strategy within the financial management of an enterprise should be viewed as the process of investment project and financial resource management in the context of current activities. It is argued that the content of the financial and investment strategy can also be viewed as a theoretical reflection of interrelated set of functions of enterprise finance and investment process finance in the goal-oriented implementation of investment projects within the framework of strategic financial management. The scientific novelty of the research consists in the development of theoretical and methodological provisions, in the development of financial and investment strategy to justify the trends of investment in business structures, the choice of the methods and the sources of their financial support to improve the quality of industrial modernization financing as the basis for Russian economy development.

J	Rotheli, TF				Roetheli, Tobias F.			Should business rely on business cycle forecasting?	CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article						Forecasting; Business cycle; Planning; Strategic management		We investigate the circumstances in which business cycle forecasting is beneficial for business by addressing both the short-run and the long-run aspects. For an assessment of short-run forecasting we make a distinction between using publicly available information of cycle probabilities and the use of resources to sharpen this outlook. A sharpened forecast can pay off because it helps the firm to optimally select its output mix. For a long-run perspective we show that firms whose optimal level of operation varies with varying selling prices gain from an accurate assessment of the likelihood of the states of expansion and recession. Petroleum refining in the U.S. is econometrically studied as an exemplary industry. The results document cyclical regularities that indicate that forecasting is advantageous for firms in this industry.

Harnessing of the Organization's Tacit and Explicit knowledge and its Management is a crucial task as Knowledge Management Practices adopted by Government Organizations are not standardized yet. They are depending on the structure and processes adopted by the organizations at their own level. This paper presents a Strategic Framework of Knowledge Management and defines Maturity Index at three levels for measuring Knowledge Management Practices adopted by an Organization. This paper defines Value of the Knowledge at all the three defined Maturity levels which is based on number of times the knowledge content is viewed, benefits gained against viewing such contents in terms of tangible asset and Socio-Economic Impact. Knowledge Management Practices adopted by Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) studied and measured at the Maturity Level is defined in this paper.

J	Yang, J				Yang, Jian			Game-theoretic modeling of players' ambiguities on external factors	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Incomplete information; Preference relation; Ambiguity; Strategic complementarities; Monotonicity; Auction	STRATEGIC COMPLEMENTARITIES; SUPERMODULAR GAME; EXPECTED UTILITY; NASH EQUILIBRIA; BELIEFS; UNCERTAINTY; RATIONALIZABILITY; PROBABILITIES; AUCTIONS	We propose a game-theoretic framework that incorporates both incomplete information and general ambiguity attitudes on factors external to all players. Our starting point is players' preferences on return distribution vectors, essentially mappings from states of the world to distributions of returns to be received by players. There are two ways in which equilibria for this preference game can be defined. Also, when the preferences possess ever more features, we can gradually add more structures to the game. These include real-valued functions over return-distribution vectors, sets of probabilistic priors over states of the world, and eventually the traditional expected-utility framework involving one single prior. We establish equilibrium existence results, show the upper hemi-continuity of equilibrium sets over changing ambiguity attitudes, and uncover relations between the two versions of equilibria. Some attention is paid to the enterprising game, in which players exhibit ambiguity-seeking attitudes while betting optimistically on the favorable resolution of ambiguities. The two solution concepts are unified at this game's pure equilibria, whose existence is guaranteed when strategic complementarities are present. The current framework can be applied to settings like auctions involving ambiguity on competitors' assessments of item worths. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

THE SERBIAN EXPERIENCE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT ECONOMICS			English	Article						Urban Public Transport; Risk Allocation; Contracts	PUBLIC TRANSPORT; EFFICIENCY; FRANCE	The past three decades have witnessed many different regulatory and institutional reforms in urban public transport (UPT) systems. Main goal of these changes was to deliver higher level of quality of transport services, defined through a diverse array of system objectives: ensuring cost-efficient service delivery, reducing subsidy, minimizing negative environmental impacts etc. To successfully achieve these objectives it is necessary to specify in detail all of the obligations, rights and risks that can be produced within and outside the system and have a strong impact on its efficiency and effectiveness. One of the main goals of defining a comprehensive contracting in the public transport of passengers is distribution of competencies and responsibilities between the parties. In the Republic of Serbia, majority of UPT systems have migrated from regulated monopoly to competitive tendering for parts or entire transport network, with dominant use of gross cost contracts. However, after initial benefits, mainly cost savings and increased quality of service, a number of deficiencies have emerged. This paper presents modified gross cost contract in which the authority remains responsible for revenues, but part of revenue risk is shared with operators based on their performance. Model is implemented in Serbian cities.

The Papar District is synonymous with one of the local entrepreneurship in Sabah which is the production of traditional cookies. The popularity of traditional cookies have brought the businesses into the international market and it has encouraged researchers to look at the factors that determine the success of traditional cookies entrepreneurs in Papar, Sabah. The main objective of this study is to examine the internal factors and external factors that have influenced the success in traditional cookies entrepreneurship. This study uses qualitative methods of informal interviews, in-depth interviews, participating involvement and observations. In this regard, 11 informants were involved in this study. Based on SWOT analysis results, this study has successfully determined the internal factors and external factors that contributes to the success of traditional cookies entrepreneurs in the Papar district. For the strength (S) aspect, the factors involved are the level of knowledge, business attitude, recipes, and business financial capital and communication skills. For weaknesses (W), factors such as weak in basic entrepreneurship, business capital constraints, negative attitudes in business, lack of communication skills and weak in management are the factors that affect the success of local entrepreneurs. Opportunities (O) analysis shows the aspects of financial assistance, the use of social media, entrepreneurship programs, customer demand and target markets have influenced the success factors of traditional cookies entrepreneurs in Papar, Sabah. Analysis of the threats (T) found that the aspects in product competition, large company domination, product quality, and production cost and resource shortage were identified as the threats factors. The results of this study are relevant especially to the stakeholders as it can be used as a strategic plan guide to develop a competitive small medium entreprenuer nationally and globally.

J	Veen, A				Veen, Alex			The bulwarking of individualised workplace relations in the mining industry: Retaining managerial control within a contested regulatory space	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS			English	Article						Australian Workplace Agreements; employment relations; Fair Work regime; individual agreements; management; managerial prerogative; mining industry; regulatory space; workplace relations	AUSTRALIA; PRODUCTIVITY; ENTERPRISE; EMPLOYMENT; MATTERS; UNIONS; STATE; LABOR	The abolition of the Australian Workplace Agreements by the Rudd Labor government in 2007 was viewed by management of mining organisations as a direct threat to the industry's preferred workplace relations. These statutory individual agreements had provided management with high levels of prerogative and excluded unions from the workplace. This qualitative case study analyses the strategic choices that management in the Western Australian mining industry made in response to these policy changes. It details how management set out on a strategic course of action to preserve as much of the existing practices as possible. Drawing upon the analytical construct of ` regulatory space', it is shown how organisations managed to consolidate their individualised workplace relations well into the collectivised FairWork regime. The construct brings to the forefront the significance of the intricacies of political processes in the making of legislation as well as the power relationships between regulators and regulatees.

The paper argues that the relationship is symbiotic; both parties have to understand the importance of adapting their engagement with one another, especially if they hope to produce brand work that is impactful for target audiences and highlights the value of good communications and marketing to leadership. Design/methodology/approach The views expressed in this practice paper are based on the author's extensive experience in the communications sector in the Middle East. Findings The paper highlights the importance of human creativity in communication campaigns, the need for bravery in marketing communications, and the need to adapt to technology. The best client/agency relationships combine the right degree of closeness and distance that allows agencies to be passionate advocates for the client while also being honest on stakeholder reactions. But, honesty requires courage. Telling a client what they need to hear and putting aside the fear of upsetting those who pay the bills in the search for the most effective creative idea takes nerve. Finally, the greatest change to the practice of communication is technology. Originality/value Although the relationship between clients and their communications agencies has been a topic of interest, much of the focus has been on the bottom line. This has been attributed to multiple reasons such as increased digital focus, or a belief among many brands that developing in-house capabilities provides better returns on investment. This practice paper addresses the agency-client relationship from a different perspective arguing for a symbiotic relationship built on creativity, honesty, bravery and the need to adapt to technology.

We combine approaches from Soft OR Problem Structuring Methods in a multi-methodological framework arguing that this helps to discuss, develop and implement a new departmental strategy. The proposed framework uses elements of Soft Systems Methodology; Strategic Options Development and Analysis to understand and structure the situation; Value-Focused Thinking to define the means and objectives; and Value-Focused Brainstorming to highlight the potential solutions. We conceptualise a four-phased systemic framework linking elements of the above four Soft OR approaches and apply it to a real-world case in a department where a new team leader was appointed with the specific brief to improve the departmental strategy and its performance in general. Findings suggest that combining the approaches into a framework encourages trust and participation from stakeholders which, in practice, is translated into an improved strategy for the organisation. A reflection on the multi-methodological approach is proposed. Conclusions and points for further research are suggested.

J	Achtenhagen, L; Melesko, S; Ots, M				Achtenhagen, Leona; Melesko, Stefan; Ots, Mart			Upholding the 4th estate-exploring the corporate governance of the media ownership form of business foundations	JMM-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON MEDIA MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sweden; Scandinavia; newspaper; qualitative research	NEWS; PLURALISM; QUALITY; MARKETS; MODELS	Whereas media ownership issues have interested scholars for decades, research has largely ignored the implications of specific ownership forms on the corporate governance of media companies, that is, how these companies are directed and controlled. This article attempts to address this gap by exploring the corporate governance of the ownership form of business foundations-a type of ownership that is increasing in different countries around the world. We analyze the corporate governance of three business foundations in the Swedish newspaper sector that together hold 26% of the market and outperform their industry peers. The control function, which is at the heart of corporate governance, is typically performed by companies' owners. However, foundations do not have a physical person as owner; thus, this control function is replaced by the foundation's charter, which stipulates the aim of the foundation's business activities. When steered by professional top management, the charter's long-term orientation facilitates the careful implementation of strategic directions without short-term performance pressures. We conclude the article by outlining several advantages and disadvantages of this ownership form for the media industry.

J	Ahmed, F; Kumar, P				Ahmed, Faisal; Kumar, Pravin			Toward a national participation index for developing countries in the global value chains: A graph theoretic modelling approach	JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						India; Developing countries; Global value chains; Graph theory; G-NPI	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; EXPORT PERFORMANCE; TRADE	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify factors which influence participation of developing countries in the global value chains (GVC) and to present a mathematical modeling technique to calculate a National Participation Index of a developing country in the GVC (hereinafter referred to as G-NPI). Design/methodology/approach The paper identifies 17 factors, encompassing both country-specific and firm-specific considerations that influence a developing countries' participation in the GVCs. These factors have been grouped into four sets of enablers, namely, macroeconomic, geo-economic, strategic and geopolitical. The national participation index (G-NPI) has been calculated using the graph theoretic modeling approach. Findings Besides identifying the factors of a developing country's participation in the GVC and grouping them as enablers, the paper considers the case of India as an example and assesses the level of interactions within (i.e. among various factors of a given enabler) and among these enablers (leading to a G-NPI value) using graph theory. Practical implications The findings can be used to calculate G-NPI for different countries to ascertain their potential for participation and also to find the factors(s) which may be deterring their participation in the GVCs. Social implications This paper can help in policy advocacy to enhance the competitiveness of developing countries and consequently to improve the life of their consumers. Originality/value This paper introduces the concept of G-NPI and presents a unique way of assessing a developing country's participation in the GVCs through a mathematical modeling approach.

The empirical estimates capture the upward shift in public debt growth from the onset of the Great Recession. The results also show how policy makers have managed to curb the growth of public indebtedness in Serbia between 2014Q4-2017Q4. The government should, however, put greater fiscal efforts to reduce the overall share of public debt in gross domestic product in accordance with the fiscal rules of the Republic of Serbia and the Maastricht convergence criteria.

J	Avila, O; Goepp, V; Kiefer, F				Avila, Oscar; Goepp, Virginie; Kiefer, Francois			Addressing alignment concerns into the design of domain-specific information systems	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Manufacturing strategy; Manufacturing technology; Modelling; Business performance; Business and IT alignment	STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT; BUSINESS ALIGNMENT; TECHNOLOGY; ENTERPRISE; ENVIRONMENT; INNOVATION; SUPPORT	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to find alignment concerns (e.g. requirements, restrictions and issues) and addressing them into the design and development of domain-specific information systems (ISs) supporting product manufacturing. Design/methodology/approach The approach is based on two metamodels of the Strategic Alignment Model that formalise its underlying concepts. The metamodels are used to build specific alignment models that define the elements to be aligned and the corresponding alignment sequences. The models and alignment sequences are intended to guide the design and development of an aligned domain-specific IS. An industrial case study for the manufacturing industry shows the feasibility of this approach. Findings The instantiation of the alignment models components with information about the specific-domain IS project enabled us to deal with current and future concerns into the design of ISs aligned with the manufacturing strategy and infrastructures. Originality/value IS alignment is generally tackled at a strategic level, in this paper the operational and tactical levels are also addressed.

J	Awan, TM; Li, XL; Wang, HZ				Awan, Tahir Mumtaz; Li, Xiaolin; Wang Haizhong			FACTORS AFFECTING EMPLOYEE-BASED BRAND EQUITY: EVIDENCE FROM CHINA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Employee-based brand equity; Brand management; China; Employee behavior; Competitive advantage	PERCEIVED ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT; ROLE CLARITY; DISSEMINATION; ANTECEDENTS; BEHAVIOR; ORIENTATION; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; CONSTRUCT; IMPACT	Employee-based brand equity (EBBE) has been receiving increasing attention in recent years. However, most studies focus on the construct definition and scale development, as well as the effects that EBBE may have on corporate performance. Few studies try to identify the source of EBBE, or in other words, the antecedents of EBBE. The major study of the antecedents of EBBE is King and Grace's model (2010), which is restricted to the service industry. As this research is cultural context-dependent, it is necessary to test the framework of King and Grace's model (2010) in other regions or industries. Replication studies are important for the generalizability of strategic management theories as reputed journals such as the Academy of Management Journal (AMJ) and the Strategic Management Journal (SMJ) have proposed. Therefore, this study was designed to test King and Grace's model (2010) in an eastern cultural context (China) and covers several non-service sector industries. The results confirmed King and Grace's model to a high extent, which has significant implications for firms in developing countries.

This method leads to the definition of the strategic vision of the intermediary, including its value proposition and its required competencies, assuming that actors in the value chain are prepared to revise their business approach to enable effective collaboration and knowledge sharing. The method is used to support management of public forests in the Province of Quebec, in Eastern Canada. Basically, the intermediary, referred to as the integrator-supplier (IS) in the application case, enables several stakeholders, including the government, the forest industry, regional authorities, recreation organizations, and First Nations, to communicate, to set compatible goals, and to synchronize their activities. These activities and interactions must all be effectively carried out to maximize the overall benefits of forest management. Three critical issues for successful development of the IS are identified. The results present functional descriptions of seven development scenarios for effective use of intermediation in forest value chains.

Design/methodology/approach: In order to reach this goal, the single case study method was used. Initially, it was made a bibliometric with "portfolio management" subject followed by the term "decision-making". Thus, it was possible to do an analysis about the relationships between the themes. Findings: One of the findings of this research was the migration of the portfolio management process vision, from project controls tools to a process that aims at a strong alignment with the strategic management of the organization. This is an important point to academic implication. Research limitations/implications: The main academic implications of this research were to show how it is possible to construct a model about the relations between project portfolio management and decision-making. Practical implications: Regarding the practical implications, it was verified the importance of the analysis of the portfolio for decision-making, to the detriment of the evaluation of only one project. Social implications: Thus, the companies can now concentrate its efforts in the analysis of profitability and return on investment of the projects, assisting the whole process of decision-making. Originality/value: The portfolio management influences the decision-making process.

J	Baskarada, S; Hanlon, B				Baskarada, Sasa; Hanlon, Brian			Corporate portfolio management in the public sector	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Strategic management; Public sector; Corporate portfolio management; Product-portfolio matrix; Growth share matrix	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; FUTURE; BUSINESS; ORGANIZATIONS; TOOL	Purpose - Although corporate portfolio management (CPM) has been a popular tool for strategic management of multi-business portfolios in the private sector since the late 1960s, it has received limited attention in the public sector. Accordingly, empirical research on the use of CMP in government organizations is virtually non-existent. The purpose of this paper is to partially fill that gap in the literature by highlighting and discussing some of the key points that public sector organizations may need to consider when adopting CPM. Design/methodology/approach - Rather than deductively proposing and testing narrowly specified hypotheses, this study aims to answer a broad research question, namely: What are the key points that public sector organizations may need to consider when adopting CMP? Hence, the study adopts the qualitative interpretive research paradigm. The findings are based on empirical research conducted in a large Australian publicly funded research organization. Potential application of CPM was iteratively and incrementally explored with a reference group comprising 15 middle management representatives and several members of the senior leadership group over the course of one year. Findings - Assessment criteria traditionally used in CPM (e.g. growth potential and market share) are generally not applicable in public sector organizations. This paper suggests that government organizations should instead consider past performance and future potential of individual business units, which may be operationalized via capability (a function of human capital and associated resources/infrastructure) and delivery (a function of the demand for, and the impact of, relevant business units). The paper also highlights the importance of organization-wide consultation, evidence-based decision making, and contestability. Originality/value - From a practical perspective, the paper may assist public sector organizations with adapting and applying CPM. From a theoretical perspective, the paper highlights an important and relatively neglected research problem, and suggests several avenues for future research.

To this end, this study examines roles undertaken by authors in the field of learning organizations. Identifying role typologies first requires revealing the author citation network in the field. Citation network is a matrix that summarizes citations and citation numbers between authors. To construct this matrix, articles in the local and general literature in the field of learning organizations, published and indexed between January 01, 2015 and February 20, 2017, were collected from Google Scholar by using the Java-based Selenium Library. An author citation network with 19,525 actors was created from this list. A social network analysis was conducted to identify author roles, followed by a discussion of what these roles mean for the local literature. Despite defining four typologies, observing only one type of role typology indicates that the local literature is not well integrated with the general literature. This study recommends strategic assessments for increasing the contribution ability of local literature to general one. Using this approach, it would be possible to find answers to the questions of which roles to develop via which authors and relationships, and how to remove the obstacles to development of local literature.

INTERRELATIONS BETWEEN THE REGIONAL ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PETROCHEMICAL CLUSTER (ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TATARSTAN)	AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH			English	Article						regional economy; oil and gas chemical complex; network arrow diagram of precedence	CYCLIC CARBONATES	The development of the economy of the Russian Federation in modem conditions is based on the development of the economic systems of the regions. The decentralization of political power and the denationalization of the economy that take place in the process of reforms objectively lead to the shift of the center of gravity in making decisions on key economic and social problems of the territories directly to the regions. In the economic system of each country there are always branch blocks that play the most important role in shaping the trends of socio-economic development. In Russia, they include a complex of resource use sectors, electric power industry, as well as petrochemical industry. At present, they are the basis for the development of new industries and the basis for the modernization of traditional branches of the economy. The petrochemical complex of the country, representing one of the most complex complexes of the national economy, is a strategic branch of the Russian economy since it is to a certain extent connected with national economic security, as well as with environmental protection and a number of other socio-economic indicators of the sustainable development of economic systems. One of the main features of the development of the petrochemical industry at the present time is a sharp increase in its scale. Over the past five years, the production of chemical and petrochemical products has grown more than 1.5 times. The petrochemical complex is the base segment of Russian industry, which lays the foundation for its long-term and stable development and has a significant impact on structural changes in the economy, which have a significant macroeconomic effect and affect the level of national competitiveness and the growth rate of the economy as a whole. In this regard, the task of developing methodological bases for the functioning of the petrochemical complex within the framework of effective resource use, identifying current trends in its development, is an actual scientific task, the solution of which has the most important organizational management significance for the development of the regional economy and the successful implementation of the program for Russia's transition to sustainable development. In the light of the above, a study of the issues of the influence of the petrochemical complex on the development of the region's economy is a particularly urgent and important task requiring close attention and solutions.

Human resource executives and post-IPO firm growth	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic leadership; Firm growth; Strategic human resource management; Human resource executive	ORGANIZATIONAL GROWTH; LIFE-CYCLE; VENTURE GROWTH; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; TEAM; STRATEGY; POWER; ORCHESTRATION; BUSINESS	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between human resource (HR) executive representation in top management and the growth of newly public firms. It draws upon research on strategic leadership, strategic HR management and Penrose's theory of firm growth to consider the role of HRs executives in addressing demands placed upon top managers in the pursuit of firm growth. This study attempts to extend the focus of research on the influence of HR executives on organizational outcomes Design/methodology/approach In order to test study hypotheses, this study analyses data from a sample of US newly public firms that underwent initial public offerings (IPO) during the 2007 calendar year. Study data were analyzed using ordinary least squares regression in order to test study hypotheses. Findings This study provides general support for study hypotheses. First, HR executive presence in top management was found to be positively related to post-IPO firm growth. Second, upper echelon size and the number of firm employees were found to weaken the positive effect of HR executive presence in top management on post-IPO firm growth. Research limitations/implications As a consequence of study design, the results found in this study may be limited with respect to their external validity. Therefore, researchers and practitioners are encouraged to use caution before generalizing study findings to other contexts. Practical implications This study provides implications for top management team staffing and the pursuit of firm growth. Newly public firms appear to benefit in terms of firm growth by including HR executives in top management. The benefits of doing so appear to be reduced for newly public firms as the size of their upper echelons and number of employees increase. Originality/value This study extends research on the firm level consequences of HR executive presence in top management as well as research on factors which influence firm growth.

J	Benedito, E; Corominas, A				Benedito, Ernest; Corominas, Albert			Embodying decisions on work shifts into strategic manufacturing capacity planning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						strategic capacity planning; work shifts; manufacturing industry; mixed integer linear programming; optimal decision model		In spite of the obvious impact that decisions on workforce planning have on the capacity of a production system, they are rarely mentioned in strategic capacity planning literature. This paper analyses the implications of embodying decisions on work shifts in strategic capacity planning and proposes a mathematical programming model that allows treating any type of relationship between the intensity in the use of the production equipment and maintenance and variable production costs. A computational experiment shows that the model can be solved in acceptable computing times for moderate values of the number of types of equipment and of work shifts. Using the model, the optimal solutions for diverse scenarios are presented and compared with those obtained under the assumption that the work shifts must be kept invariable over the entire horizon.

J	Black, H				Black, Helen			ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGE AND INNOVATIVENESS: ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE OR RENEWABLE ORGANIZATIONAL ENERGY?	ASIA-PACIFIC MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING JOURNAL			English	Article						organizational climate change; renewable organizational energy; innovativeness; management control system	ESTIMATING INTERRATER AGREEMENT; POLITICS SCALE POPS; TEAM CLIMATE; INDIVIDUAL CREATIVITY; MARKET ORIENTATION; BUSINESS SERVICES; FIRM PERFORMANCE; MULTILEVEL MODEL; WORK-ENVIRONMENT; STRENGTH	This paper examines how understanding the current climate for change and innovativeness in an organisational unit can inform decision making, strategic management and future change initiatives to enhance innovativeness. Specifically, this study contributes to the growing literature with a focus on using management control systems in pursuit of innovation outcomes and assesses the current climate for change and innovativeness in three organisational units. Using the data collected from a quantitative survey, this study demonstrates that intangible elements that influence change and innovation initiatives can be measured, understood and managed through decision-making and strategy development to drive future outcomes. The results show that each of the sample organisations has different strengths and weaknesses, each individual unit is unique, and analysis of the current climate highlights areas that may impede change and innovative processes. This is useful tool for managers and management accountants when interpreting performance results and/or developing strategies and future actions.

J	Borshch, V; Shchur, R; Chuvakov, O				Borshch, Viktoriia; Shchur, Roman; Chuvakov, Oleg			MOTIVATION AND STIMULATION MECHANISM OF MEDICAL STAFF IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: MAIN CHALLENGES AND WAYS OF ITS IMPROVING IN UKRAINE	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						stimulation; motivation; medical staff; remuneration of medical staff; system of grids; health care system; medical reform		The main purpose of the article is to propose the effective instruments of motivation and stimulation of the medical staff within the modern Healthcare Reform in Ukraine. In the article, the main problems and challenges of the stimulation and motivation process of the medical personnel in Ukraine are viewed. The theoretical basis of the motivation process is considered. This article analyses the approach of the differentiation of the "stimulation" and "motivation" categories. The point is stressed that motivation's main goal is a state change in the medical organization from the point of view of personnel management, and the stimulation is directed to confirming this state. So these two processes are the part of one strategic mechanism of the personnel management and should complement each other. The current situation in the labour market of the healthcare sector is examined. The main issues of this market are defined. And on the basis of the specified problems, the instruments and methods of stimulation of medical staff are proposed by the author. The system of grids as the part of the financial and monetary incentives at the medical establishment is offered with the purpose of its medical staff's activity improvement. The practical importance of the scientific research results lies in detailing the motivation and stimulation process and its detailed analysis from the point of view of the healthcare sector, which is important for the further development of the healthcare sphere in Ukraine. Methodology. The methodological basis of the article is the complex of methods, including methods of scientific cognition, analysis and synthesis, systematization and scientific abstraction. The informational basis of the conducted research is the scientific works of the domestic and foreign scientists in the sphere of management and organization of health care, the statistical data of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine, legal and regulatory documents of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine. Results. The proposed mechanism of medical staff's motivation and stimulation allows solving the problems related to the shortage of the medical staff, the quality of their activity and their performance improvement etc. Further research directions are aimed at the study of all aspects of managerial capital formation and improvement in the healthcare field.

J	Brahma, M; Tripathi, SS				Brahma, Mita; Tripathi, Shiv S.			Performance of internal corporate ventures: the effect of team interactions and the absorptive capacity of the firm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						internal corporate venture; absorptive capacity; strategic consensus; team cohesion; team conflict; venture performance	STRATEGIC CONSENSUS; ENTREPRENEURIAL TEAMS; CONFLICT; MANAGEMENT; COHESION; MODEL; WORK; EXPLORATION; LEADERSHIP; CREATION	Internal corporate ventures are launched by organisations to create value and build competitive advantage. This research investigates the effect of interactions among venture team members and the absorptive capacity of the organisation on the performance of the venture. The interaction factors investigated are task conflict, relationship conflict, process conflict, cohesion and strategic consensus. Through a survey administered to 124 executives working in internal corporate ventures across 14 industries, the research concluded that conflict has a negative association with venture performance. Cohesion and strategic consensus have a positive association with venture performance. The absorptive capacity of the organisation has a mediating effect on the strategic consensus-performance relationship. A multi-group analysis shows that for venture team members, the strongest relationship is between process and relationship conflict; for team leaders, the strongest relationship is between task and relationship conflict. The findings contribute to an understanding of determinants of venture performance.

These collaborative efforts built upon strategic leadership at government and university level, an appropriate resource base and engaged practitioners who developed and embedded research opportunities that built upon a shared commitment to research on environmental values in the source zone of the Yellow River. We highlight how a landscape framing brought together divergent mindsets, methodologies and practices in this collaborative research, providing an effective platform to share experiences, discuss perspectives and develop research outcomes.

This study aims to analyze the actors and the value chain map of catfish, problems in the value chain of catfish, and the strategies to improve the value chain. This research was conducted by survey method using questionnaire instrument. The survey was done by using purposive sampling technique to 23 catfish farmers, 7 catfish wholesalers, 5 catfish retailers, and 5 catfish processors in Bogor Regency. In this study, there are 4 channels of the value chain of catfish from the production to the consumer. The four actors who are involved in the value chain, namely farmer, wholesaler, retailer, and processor. The constraints along the value chain consist of three aspects: pre-production, production, and post-harvest. Pre-production problems include the quality of seeds, high price of feed, and lack of capital. Problems on production are the weather, fish mortality, and social security. Problems facing post-production cover price instability and lack of bargaining power of farmers. Proposed up-grading strategies to improve the competitiveness are strengthening partnership among farmers, strengthening partnerships between farmers and other strategic partners (traders, and feed companies).

We selected 269 stock public-listed firms to examine the separate and their joint effects on systematic risk. From our findings, high diversification configuration significantly leads to high systematic risk. However, systematic risk goes worse at high levels of country and region diversification. The findings led to the conclusion that the effect through "China involvement" which had co-opted and caught the strategic resources from the regions to focus its FDI policy objectives especially expands the country scope. It's important to consider how to maintain the competitiveness of their ventures in China to expand the markets overseas. The contribution is to connect the impact factors to analyze which model is beneficial for MNEs to evaluate the risk management in emerging economy. The results point out MNEs should use resource-based advantages through moderate diversification strategy and middle China involvement strategy to access to better risk management and reduce systematic risk.

J	Chen, YS; Chou, JCL; Chen, WR				Chen, You-Shyang; Chou, Jerome Chih-Lung; Chen, Wei-Ru			Long-term Strategic Development Application by a Two-stage Expert-based AHP Model for the Internet Plus Era: a Leading TFT-LCD Manufacturer Case	JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Internet Plus; Strategic Development; Two-stage Applications; Expert-based Interview; Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS; BIG DATA; ACQUISITIONS; MERGERS; FORCES	Regarding TFT-LCD industry from globalization to glocalization, manufacturer faces severe challenges and problems, such as how to enhance business model strategy for product value and quality and thus increase customers' acceptance, how to strengthen customers' purchase willingness and convenience, and how to reduce the operating cost from localization overview, for considerations of lone-term strategy. These challenges/problems are intensified while business model changes to cope with the rising trend of smart life and e-commerce in the Internet Plus era, resulting in a dramatic turbulence of demand and supply. Due to significant advances in this era, some expert-based methods like variants of AHPto solve real-world problems can improve the industry applications to understand long-term strategic development and assure product resource for different industries. Although the past decade has seen considerable progress in the business strategy development, large mergers and acquisitions (M&A) case analyses have lacked in TFT-LCD industry. Thus, this study proposes a two-stage expert-based AHPmodel to experience the best practice of a leading TFT-LCD manufacturer to explore issues of strategic development under such circumstances. In the first stage, after the in-depth interviews with strategy-makers of the case company, we orderly gained four dimensions: technical innovation, resource integration, customer service, and M&A strategy, and 18 factors for developing the long-term strategy. For the second stage, we used the expert-based AHP model to prioritize the factors and found smart application, innovative capability, customized service, and innovative business value are key strategic factors to create business value and increase competitiveness advantage.

Data were collected from a maguey pulquero cooperative society through the use of a strategic planning and investment instrument. The commercial diagnostic phases, market research and products portfolio design were considered. To obtain information for the portfolio, a productive chain analysis was conducted, considering productive links, post-harvest management and commercialisation. Market research was done in two important market centres in influential regions, where knowledge and frequency of consumption of maguey pulquero products was identified. The Boston Consulting Group Matrix was used to integrate the portfolio's products and by-products, and the Ansoff Matrix was employed to determine the product's positioning. Finally, an investment and economic viability analysis of the products portfolio was carried out. Six products were identified, with pulque and agave syrup being the investment priority products owing to the profits they generate. Penca, ixtle and paper generate complementary income. The strategies for pulque and agave syrup are market penetration, and the strategies for the remaining products are market and product development. The analysis of products include positive-tonet present value, investment return rate and cost benefit ratio.

The provision of care is still very fragmented; therefore, how to integrate care is crucial to optimise the use of resources and to improve outcomes, especially regarding value created for patients. In this paper, we identify determinants of care integration and discuss strategic and structural alternatives that encourage it. The research had two phases. First, we conducted a literature review and four initial exploratory interviews, to position the study and to ground the next steps. Then, the object of study was redefined by a more exhaustive literature review and 15 semi-structured interviews with key experts, to outline the central concepts and dimensions under study and to delimit the field of study with a view to build a conceptual model for the analysis and understanding of healthcare integration.

J	Elrod, R; Mielish, J				Elrod, Rachael; Mielish, Julia			Strategic Partnerships: Thinking Outside the Administrative Box	COMMUNITY COLLEGE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article							BOTTOM-UP; TOP-DOWN	This study examines the strategic partnership and bottom-up style of management used by Wake Technical Community College (WTCC) in Raleigh, North Carolina. WTCC uses a strategic partnership initiative called SAIL (Succeed, Achieve, Improve, Learn), which engages employees to become involved in the process of institutional improvement. In the SAIL initiative, planning and governance of proposed activities are initiated outside of administrative offices. Strategic partnerships are often used to help solve problems which is what SAIL is intended to do. The SAIL process takes place over three phases: Phase I involves topic identification, Phase II consists of proposal development, and Phase III consists of the evaluation and selection of the winning proposal. Phase I encourages all WTCC faculty, staff, and administration to be involved in addressing critical issues on campus by submitting a Request for Proposal that will contribute to institutional enhancement. WTCC used the SAIL process when deciding on their next Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP), an integral part of the accrediting process of schools accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The result was a QEP proposal that had been evaluated and chosen by all employees interested in participating. When employees are involved in initiating change, they are empowered and projects are implemented that impact staff in a meaningful way because they are the ones who initiated the idea.

Stakeholder Involvement: An Identified Invaluable Resource in the Management and Conservation of Ireland's Natural Religious Heritage Croagh Patrick: Insights and Challenges	ALMATOURISM-JOURNAL OF TOURISM CULTURE AND TERRITORIAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Heritage Conservation; Croagh Patrick Ireland; Natural Heritage Management; Stakeholder-Involvement; Sacred Site	ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT; TOURISM; COLLABORATION; PERCEPTIONS; IMPACTS	This paper seeks to explore how the concept of stakeholder involvement has been applied for the very first time in the management and conservation of the 800 years old Ireland's Holy mountain Croagh Patrick. In doing so, it explores factors that facilitate and hinder the effectiveness of this new-found partnership towards the sustainable management of this sacred natural site, which simultaneously serves as a place of pilgrimage and tourism. Crucial given scholarly demand for greater understanding of the opportunities and barriers that stakeholder involvement may entail, Woodland & Acott (2007), and even more crucial given that routes and directions for practically implementing sustainability in tourism remain unclear Walingo et al., (2013), and more importantly, the paucity of empirical research that explores the effectiveness and challenges in collaborative efforts towards the management of tourism at sacred sites, especially at holy mountains that are yet to be designated as world heritage sites within the religious and pilgrimage tourism scholarship (RPTS). Utilising a mixed-methodological approach to inquiry, and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders across a range of stakeholder groupings, revealed crucial drivers and inhibitors to the partnership, to include issues of shared ownership, power dynamics, strategic management and stakeholder marginalisation and representativeness in decision-making and planning processes. The study has implications for the conservation/management of natural religious heritages/landscapes where there is the need to understand the practicality in the formation of stakeholder groupings in the sustainable management of many such heritages.

Water source planning in arid zones using low impact development (lid) approach (case study: The Basin of Salt Lake and Central Desert, Iran)	UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Spatial strategic planning; low impact development (lid); water sensitive city; environmental sustainability; The Basin of the Salt Lake and Central Desert of Iran		Water is literally the stuff of life. A clear understanding of present and future sources of water and of strategies for the effective management of water resources is in the interest of every country. The challenge is urgent because human population demands, as well as climate change, make once secure sources uncertain. Moreover, water projects are often large and expensive and take many years to complete, so future planning is crucial. For any one person, the ecological environment is very important, it can provide for human survival and development of material basis and the necessary variety of other conditions. Inappropriate if the ecological environment, human beings can not survive and develop. We can say that human existence and development, are dependent on a suitable environment. One element of singularity of place that remains is time (and history) manifest through architecture and the constructed environment. Two views of both cities-cross-sectional and plan-reveal very different urban morphologies. The theory is that if the pre-development distribution of in-stream flows is maintained, then the baseline capacity to transport sediment, a proxy for the geomorphic condition, will be maintained as well. A popular method of mimicking the pre-development flow regime is via flow duration control (FDC). As it turns out, storage requirements for flow duration control tend to be much larger than that for surface water treatment requirements, particularly when the storm water facilities are small, distributed facilities with simple outlet structures, such as those designed for Low Impact Development (LID) Low-impact development (LID) methods can cost less to install, have lower operations and maintenance (O&M) costs, and provide more cost-effective storm water management and water-quality services than conventional storm water controls. LID also provides ecosystem services and associated economic benefits that conventional storm water controls do not.

J	Arroyo, PE; Holmen, E; De Boer, L				Ester Arroyo, Pilar; Holmen, Elsebeth; De Boer, Luitzen			Integration in loosely coupled garment supply chains: The case of a Mexican trader as switchboard operator	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC SOURCING			English	Article						Qualitative; Mexico; Industrial networks; Supply chain integration; System theory; Trader intermediaries	INTERMEDIARIES; NETWORK; IMPACT; POWER	Purpose This paper aims to deliberate about the problem of tight and seamless integration in a supply chain by conceptualising and understanding how looseness and its creation represent an effective supply chain design. Design/methodology/approach This research is grounded in system theory and industrial network research, while the case study of a textile and garment supply network coordinated by a third party in Mexico empirically illustrates how looseness in the supply chain may be created. The information gathered through in-depth interviews with critical informants at Aztex and three of their suppliers, visits in situ and secondary information, was organised with the template analysis technique and interpreted from three different but complementary perspectives, system theory, supply chain coordination modes and industrial networks, to establish the particularities of the triad model. Findings The study shows that supply chain integration may take place in a variety of forms, and that new theoretical perspectives are required to understand how the looseness in the connections among actors contributes to the flexibility and efficiency of the chain. Additionally, the analysis of the case puts forward the trader's crucial role as linking pin between suppliers and customers in the specific context of the garment sector. Research limitations/implications Additional cases and triangulation of information from traders, suppliers and customers would contribute to explore in more detail how integration takes place not only in the textile and garment industry sector but also in other industries. Practical implications A rational explanation of why establish full integration across several tiers of suppliers and customers is too difficult to attain is given to managers. They may recognise that tight couplings will be necessary and possible only with strategic counterparts; meanwhile, others are more suitable to be delegated to a third party. Social implications The economic and industrial stability and progress of low-cost sourcing countries depends on the selection of international purchasers. The advancement of triangle manufacturing facilitated by a trader may become another criterion to drive the selection towards a region. In the case of Mexico, this adds to the near sourcing advantages of the country. Originality/value The research confirms that there is no unique global mode of supplier integration and suggests that different approaches are viable as long as the objectives of operational efficiency, good customer service and flexibility are satisfied.

J	Faizova, S; Ivanova, M; Pozhuieva, T				Faizova, Svitlana; Ivanova, Marina; Pozhuieva, Tetiana			PROSPECTS FOR IMPROVING THE METHODOLOGY OF STRATEGIC ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						strategic enterprise management; Balanced Scorecard; balanced scorecard methodology; methodology of eventological analysis; analytic hierarchy process		The prospects and directions of improvement of the methodology for strategic enterprise management have been highlighted. The subject of the research is theoretical and methodological aspects of creating a strategic enterprise management system based on the concept of a Balanced Scorecard (BSC). It has been revealed that in the context of changing the concept of the enterprise strategic development toward the growth of its intellectual capital as the main factor of competitiveness, the evolution of the enterprise management and planning system from strategic enterprise management to balanced enterprise management is taking place. The balanced scorecard has been defined as the basic concept of balanced enterprise management. The purpose of the study is to outline the prospects and directions for improving the methodology of strategic enterprise management under the conditions of its evolution into balanced enterprise management. Results. On the basis of a mathematical representation of the sphere of strategic responsibility (SSR) of the enterprise as an organizational and infrastructural environment for balanced enterprise management, it has been proved that the interaction of the SSR content components results in a synergistic effect of its expansion. This, in turn, determines the necessity and possibility of distributing the company's SSR beyond its management and involving the initiative owners in the process of balanced enterprise management. Accordingly, the prospects for improvement of the strategic enterprise management methodology have been defined as an integration of strategic management systems, approaches, methods and the BSC with non-traditional eventological methods combined with the analytic hierarchy process. It has been proved that, from the standpoint of the eventology, subjective observations and the mathematical apparatus of the theory of random events allow identification of general statistical regularities of the probabilistic set distribution in various, including management, systems. From the standpoint of a balanced approach, the need for enriching the methodology of the BSC as a system of balanced enterprise management, using the eventological analysis, is being boosted by the need to take into account the growing number of random, multi-directional and seemingly unrelated factors in the management process. Methodology. The following research methods were used in the study: the expert assessment method, factor analysis - for the formation of the management panel of the BSC; the eventological scoring and analytic hierarchy process - for balancing and structuring key performance indicators (KPI), economic and mathematical methods - to analyse the SSRs of the enterprise as an organizational and infrastructural environment for balanced enterprise management; a critical analysis - to compare alternative approaches to the formation of the BSC. Value/originality. To achieve the purpose of the study, the BSC methodology has been presented as a system of balanced enterprise management. A methodical approach to balancing and structuring KPIs, using the results of eventological analysis and analytic hierarchy process, has been proposed. Its practical implications include the possibility of reaching the target balance of indicators taking into account weighing coefficients of the main indicator selection criteria, the possibility to determine the whole system balance index as the average of the balance indices of each of the indicators that characterize the enterprise performance. The ways of implementing the methods of e-scoring and analytic hierarchy process for the assessment and correction of the enterprise's strategy have been studied. Integration of e-scoring with the strategic enterprise management method and the BSC methodology provides an effective vertical communication as the basic principle of balanced enterprise management, which extends the scope of strategic responsibility to subordinate initiative owners.

J	Farrell, M				Farrell, Maggie			LEADERSHIP REFLECTIONS: ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE	JOURNAL OF LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						management; culture; change management; behaviors		Organizations function as small societies with their unique behaviors, patterns, and communication. Organizational culture describes how individuals work within libraries and the patterns, assumptions, values, attitudes, and behavior that help an organization to operate within its environment and achieve, or not achieve, its mission. Effective leaders must understand the operational framework of their libraries in order to be successful in managing or to change the culture in support of strategic goals. Changing the culture of an organization is difficult and a long-term process with a realistic understanding of the current behaviors and a determined vision for how an organization should work. There are some specific strategies that may aid leaders in transforming a library culture into a productive and effective set of behaviors that will contribute to a library's success.

Design/methodology/approach The authors led a series of discussions to develop a CDVC specific to existing HIV/AIDS services in Northern Togo. Using the CDVC framework, 28 specific gaps in service delivery were identified and integrated into a strategic QI plan. Findings At 12 months, 92 percent of delivery gaps had demonstrated improvement. The CDVC framework proved to be valuable in the following ways. First, it facilitated the first comprehensive mapping of HIV/AIDS services in the Kara region of Togo. Second, it enabled the identification of gaps or insufficiencies in the currently available services across the full continuum of care. Third, it catalyzed the creation of a strategic QI plan based on identified gaps. Research limitations/implications This case description is the authors' experience in one setting and should not be considered comparative in nature. Furthermore, the approach described may not be applicable to all initiatives and/or organizations. As described, the lack of sophisticated and comprehensive data collection systems limited the authors' ability to collect reliable data on some of the QI initiatives planned. Practical implications The operationalization of the CDVC framework is an effective approach to drive continuous QI. Originality/value Through the operationalization of the CDVC, the authors developed a new approach for assessing existing services, identifying gaps in service delivery and directing continuous QI initiatives in a strategic manner.

J	Fisher, R; Francis, M; Thomas, A; Mutter, K; Jones, O				Fisher, Ron; Francis, Mark; Thomas, Andrew; Mutter, Kath; Jones, Owen			CONCEPTIONS OF VALUE AS FAMILY RESEMBLANCES: A THEORETICAL MODEL AND METHODOLOGY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Value; family resemblances; phenomenography; conceptions; computer-aided lexical analysis; Higher Education	VALUE CO-CREATION; SERVICE-DOMINANT LOGIC; IN-SERVICE; PHENOMENOGRAPHY; SCIENCE	This paper discusses actors' conceptions of the nature of value. Value is an important facet in contemporary management paradigms and an integral part of business and education. Yet research over many years has failed to discover an essence or necessary condition of value. Consequently, the nature of value remains unclear. Recent research suggests that value is individual and experiential, and is more appropriately conceptualised in terms of family resemblances. Conceptualising value as a family supports a proposition that the nature of value may differ between people, time and place, though some aspects of it may be the same. In the context of a UK university we combine a new theoretical approach to understanding value with an adapted phenomenographic methodology and method. Thus, we are able to discover different conceptions of value while retaining the ability to build common understanding in a given context. Data are collected by means of interviews and narrative reports from actors at strategic and operational levels of a UK university, postgraduate students and prospective employers. Analysis is by means of computer-aided lexical analysis and template analysis.

Current study provides a conclusive finding as a way out of the unsolved debate among those views by testing the non-linear effects of strategic and financial control determinants of budgetary slack. Using the sample from Indonesian Business Units and thorough analyses using non-monotonic structural equation modeling we found the presence of (inverse) U-shaped relationships between those strategies on reliance on accounting performance measures and budgetary slack.

J	Geisler, E; Turchetti, G				Geisler, Eliezer; Turchetti, Giuseppe			Conduit versus content: a model of the firm's market involvement and organisational competitiveness	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						conduit; content; conduit versus content; CVC; competitiveness; market involvement; genetics; DNA; strategy; core competencies; structure	1980 GENERIC STRATEGIES; RESOURCE-BASED THEORY; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION; CORE COMPETENCE; AMERICAN DATA; PERFORMANCE; ADVANTAGE; KNOWLEDGE; VIEW	This paper proposes a new model of the fundamental makeup of the firm. The model is a typology of the firm as conduit versus content. Firms are classified in this model by their function in the marketplace and the contributions they bring to their environment. The firm as conduit has a function of intervening in a market transaction as a go-between or facilitator. The firm as content has a function as a provider of its outputs to the market. The CVC model also describes the strategic competitiveness of the firm as CVC, and the differences between how the firm as conduit conjures its attributes into a competitive architecture, versus how the firm as content behaves. The unique contributions of the CVC model to the strategy and organisational analyses are described. Examples of the explanatory power of the CVC model are given in the case of the Uber transportation company, and in the case of the failed merger between AOL and Time-Warner. Further research is suggested to empirically test the CVC model, and the paper concludes with the potential applications of the model in a variety of sectors and industries, including the area of technology management.

Although service providers necessitate systematic information regarding sustainability risks, no available management tool accounts for them comprehensively. In the context of the project NaCoSi 'Ensuring Sustainability for Urban Water Systems', a risk-based sustainability management system (RSS) was developed. This paper aims to introduce RSS and to discuss its contribution towards companies' viability and transformation in the water sector. The paper describes the comprehensive self-screening approach of RSS, which is based on a causal-chain concept and comprises steps of risk analysis, monitoring and mitigation. Results of the testing phase suggest the validity of risk analysis and its effectiveness in deriving measures. Thus, RSS can help to improve the ability of service providers by analysing challenges and communicating them.

Design/methodology/approach The population in this research was policy makers in Bali Province, in relation to the development and revitalization planning of traditional market, and traders doing their activity in a traditional market. The data analysis used internal and external strategic factor matrix (IE). Findings Key external strategic variables that pose both current and future threats are information technology, bargaining power with buyers and competitors. The key internal strategic variables which are included both present and future strengths are product quality, product variety offered, uniqueness of products offered, affordable product prices, bargaining process, strategic market location, service speed and vast parking lot. Based on the business position of the present Denpasar traditional market which is in quadrant V, while in the future it will be in quadrant II, the strategy properly applied is the proper competition strategy to be grown and built. Research limitations/implications The research was only conducted to traditional markets in Bali, thus it cannot be generalized to wider areas, and this research used the survey method where the data collection process was done in a certain point of time or cross-section, whilst the environment would experience extra quick changes. Therefore, it is important to do this research in the future. Originality/value The originality for this paper shows the comprehensively development strategies, revitalization strategies in traditional market, by using strength weakness opportunity threat and IE matrix analysis, and research location which is conducted in Bali that has different tourist condition and potentials from other regions.

J	Gillespie, M				Gillespie, Michelle			The motivations, attitudes, perceptions and skills of customer service staff working in Australian university student administration	JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Customer service; student administration; motivation; attitudes; perceptions; skills	SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY	In 2012, government changes to higher education shifted Australia to a demand driven funding model. The consequential increase in student numbers, along with greater focus on retention and student satisfaction, resulted in rising customer expectations. There are now strategic imperatives to change administrative cultures to focus on delivering service excellence. This study analyses customer service behaviours of student administration staff at one Australian university. Using a conceptual framework of motivations, attitudes, perceptions and skills towards customer service, this small-scale study suggests that staff are intrinsically motivated and have largely positive attitudes towards their student customers. A gap was identified between individuals' perceptions of their customer service delivery compared with that of colleagues, while staff learn informally from their supervisors and colleagues. Finally, this paper explores how universities might develop and embed a workforce that is student-centric, delivering outstanding customer service, while at the same time upholding governance and compliance requirements.

Collective Security Treaty Organization: Origins of the Multidimensional Mandate and Modern Means for its Implementation	VESTNIK MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGANIZATSII-INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS RESEARCH JOURNAL			Russian	Article						CSTO; CIS; Eurasian security; regional cooperation; crisis management; peace-making; international terrorism		This article examines the historically contradictory development of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) following its 15th anniversary, and evaluates its political potential from the point of view of its assigned mandate. The evolution of international stability at the beginning of the century forced the contracting parties of the CSTO to formalize their mainly declarative interactions through the creation of a valid regional security organization. This new collective security forum enriched the cooperation mandate by establishing additional areas for mutual coordination including counterterrorism activities, measures to combat illegal migration and drug-trafficking, strategies to respond to natural disasters and cyber-security. The creation of the multitasking Collective Rapid Reaction Forces was the first significant step on the way to the practical realization of the CSTO. The Collective Security Strategy for the period ending in 2025 organizes the CSTO instruments of international cooperation within the CSTO crisis management framework and thus works to reduce the fragmentary nature of the CSTO. Despite the availability of the Collective Rapid Reaction Forces and the Collective Peace-Keeping Forces, the CSTO's crisis management approach gives priority to the political approaches and negotiation. Consequently, the multifunctional mandate of the CSTO predetermines its strategic role in Eurasia and allows it to achieve its political goals related to conservation of the common military and strategic area, the creation of a constraining effect, the facilitation of cooperation among law enforcement and intelligence agencies and the ability to contribute to the settlement of regional and local conflicts.

J	Hamamura, J				Hamamura, Jumpei			THE IMPACT OF AN INFORMATION LINKAGE SYSTEM ON A FIRM'S ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE, TRANSFER PRICE, AND PROFIT	ASIA-PACIFIC MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING JOURNAL			English	Article						strategic transfer pricing; organization structure; information asymmetry; information linkage system; tax	SUPPLY CHAIN; COST	This study investigates the impact of costless information linkage systems on the organization structure, transfer price, and profit of companies. These firms typically consist of a headquarters (HQ) and downstream divisions (DD). Recent research on management accounting emphasizes the importance of a firm choosing the optimal level of internal transfer price and organization structure to maximize its total profit. The study constructs an analytical model to analyze the optimal decisions a firm that faces price competition in a product market needs to make. Our mathematical analysis demonstrates that a firm's profit declines when it adopts an information linkage system that mitigates the information asymmetry between the HQ and DD in a competitive price environment. This is a novel result, since prior management accounting research indicates that information linkages between intra-organization divisions improve the firm's total profit. The result of this study is attributed to the loss of incentive for tacit collusion between competitors. The firm has no incentive to decide on the decentralization of decision rights by adopting an information linkage system. Therefore, this research has a significant implication for management accounting practice. Firms should exercise caution when adopting an information linkage system, as - under specific economic conditions - it may not improve their profits.

To illuminate this process, what we call "falling awake," we add a microfoundations dimension that high-lights the key individuals that facilitate this process - highly visible knowledge workers. Empirically, we study the global pharmaceutical industry, where we investigate which firms are the first to make investments in biotechnology and the individuals within these firms that accelerate this investment using fine-grained performance, publishing, and patenting history data from 108 incumbent pharmaceutical firms over 34 years (1970-2003). Our findings suggest that firms adopt a more aggressive approach to investments in radical new technologies after falling short of performance expectations.

Regulatory interaction with the long-term insurance industry in pursuit of market stability and financial inclusion	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							POLITICAL-ECONOMY; GOVERNANCE; SERVICES; LESSONS	This study explores how the financial regulator through interaction with the long-term insurance industry can give effect to greater market inclusion and financial stability. It follows a qualitative approach and we interview both industry representatives and the regulator. The results show that there is a possible tension between the regulatory objectives of market stability and financial inclusion and that an unbalanced focus on either objective could adversely affect the other. It suggests that the best way to ensure this balance is for industry, the regulator and government to coframe issues, rather than being obliged to rely on the regulator to draft regulation in isolation. The entry level (base of the pyramid) insurance market may require a different paradigm to 'usual' insurance constructs and this requires a more innovative approach from all stakeholders. The findings highlight strategic measures that may assist regulators in giving effect to greater market inclusion without prejudicing the stability of the market.

J	Huang, JC; Wu, TJ				Huang, Jui-Chan; Wu, Tzu-Jung			Development trend of quantity of patents of China patent law	JOURNAL OF DISCRETE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES & CRYPTOGRAPHY			English	Article						Word; Patent Law; Number of Patents; Prediction; Grey Theory		Among fierce competition, it is imperative for industry to be dedicated to adjusting strategic planning in the related R&D activities. However patent is a defensive weapon to protect R&D achievements and an attack weapon to contain the competitive opponents. The emergence of China economy generates the establishment of many own brands one after another, facilitating that China is gradually transformed from imitator. Regarding comprehensive aspect, if decision makers can use the efficient prediction tools to conduct patent trend that will benefit the establishment of precise R&D strategy. To start from this point, the research studies the patent development trend in China for the last few years. The research applies the empirical analysis to study the model accuracy. In the selection of prediction tools, Grey theory is a prevalent prediction method that can be constructed with limited information and can provide a better prediction advantage for short-term prediction. Additionally, application of Grey prediction method featured with handling non-linear problems, insufficient information sources and small sample. In the meantime, the research adds linear regression, exponential smoothing and moving average and takes some patents in China as background to conduct selection among different prediction models. The results indicate that Grey theory is not only equipped with advantage for short-term prediction but also has considerable accuracy than the other traditional models even statistics increase and is under steady growth of trend.

Furthermore, the securitized real estate indices show a greater difference in the overall calendar effect between the three methods than the general equity indices do. This study has an implication that a certain sector of the market is riskier than the whole market.	[Hui, Eddie C.

And thus the main method to stimulate economic development is to introduce innovations. Within the functioning of national innovation systems, there is the integration of science, education, capital, and production that, on the one hand, allows creating innovations and, on the other, stimulates the development of the economy precisely due to the formation of the synergetic effect of cooperation of many participants of innovative process. The subject of research is the interrelation of innovative activity with economic efficiency and economic growth at the macrolevel. Therefore, the purpose of the research is to evaluate influence of development of national innovation systems on the economic efficiency, and a number of tasks are carried out in order to achieve it: development of integrated indicators to evaluate operating efficiency of national innovation systems, identification of relationship between the level of development of national innovation systems and the level of economic development of countries, evaluation of development of individual national innovation systems, and determination of influence of the level of national innovation systems' development on the economic growth of countries. The methodology of research of influence of development level of national innovation systems on the economic growth of countries is based on building integral indices, which are calculated by using the method of geometric average of partial indices and construction of regression models, which allow evaluating the influence of development of national innovation systems on the economic efficiency. In the paper, the author's method of forming integral indicator to evaluate the level of development of national innovation systems is developed and a method of evaluating their influence on the economy is proposed. Testing of the methodology of evaluation of national innovation systems' development is carried out based on data of national innovation systems of six countries: Ukraine, Great Britain, Latvia, Germany, Poland, and France. The work proves the existence of a close positive interrelation between the index of national innovation systems' development and the index of GDP per capita, which is peculiar for all countries under study. Also, there are built regression models according to data of calculation of the index of national innovation systems' development and its elements with a quite high reliability, which allows using them in order to forecast GDP per capita under conditions of national innovation systems' development. Moreover, the paper identifies individual features of the influence of separate directions of the functioning of innovation systems on the level of economic development of the countries under study, which provides an opportunity to conduct strategic management for separate directions of the functioning of national innovation systems.

It was analyzed the modern approaches to the functioning of business incubators in Ukraine with the purpose of ensuring the initiation of effective structural changes in the national economy. Materials and methods. The experience of creating and operating business incubators in the United States, Italy, Britain, Portugal, Brazil, China has become a material for research. Results and discussion. Business incubators play an important role in the development of national economies. The creation of business incubators will provide conditions for the development of entrepreneurship in the agri-food sector, the creation of new jobs, the effective use of innovative capacity and resources. The largest number of start-up projects is in the following areas: service - 17%, trade - 13%, industry - 9%, IT - 8%, hotel and restaurant business - 7%, transport and agriculture - 6%. Implementation of the main functions of business incubators, namely: business expertise for new enterprises and financing contribute both to the economic development of regions and increasing their investment attractiveness, and to the development of entrepreneurship, ensures the implementation of innovative ideas, creating additional jobs, and improving the welfare of the population. In Ukraine the prospects of business incubators are determined by the following factors: increasing demand of business structures for new training technologies, consulting and information support; increasing demand of potential investors that not only should firms prove their steady material and financial position but also show an ability to dispose of investments provided to them; credit policy of banks forbidding companies to take up loans to purchase fixed assets, especially buildings, office and other equipment which results in an increase of their costs and reduction of current assets; pre-final stage of market formation which increases competition and makes business spend more time on sales of goods (services), diverting their attention from issues of functional management and strategic marketing; time needed for start-ups to develop and adapt to the market under terms of the current fiscal policy. Conclusion. The study of the history of the creation of business incubators in the world made it possible to identify the main directions of innovative entrepreneurship and the prospects for its development in Ukraine.

In practice, their perception denotes the extent to which they are benefiting from opening and maintaining accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, obtaining loans, maintaining communications and ensuring financial, information, and privacy rights. The results indicate that banks are creating shared value in cases of customer rights, account opening and maintenance, and deposit/withdrawal of money. However, the banks are limiting customer shared value in obtaining SME loans. The study has identified high rate of lending, huge processing costs, unusual delay in sanctioning loans, complexity in documentation and difficulties in providing collateral against loan as the core problems in obtaining SME loans.

Yet, limited information is available on the skills and knowledge areas, which are currently lacking among the healthcare workforce employed in environments with limited resources. Aims: The aim of this study was to assess the perceived healthcare workforce needs at the management and clinical/ practice levels in Lebanon. Methods: We conducted an exploratory Delphi study involving two panels of health care professionals and a nationwide survey of hospital directors to assess the skills needed and the healthcare occupations and specialties that are limited. Results: Based on the Delphi study, the top five needed skills/knowledge areas were: professionalism, ethics, quality management and improvement, strategic planning, and communication. The need for information management and technology skills was reported by more than 50% of urban hospitals, and highlighted by the two panels in the Delphi study. Healthcare professionals reported willingness to take continuing education courses. Hospitals further indicated the availability of financial support and willingness to collaborate with educational institutions for employee training and continuing education. Conclusions: Our findings set the ground for future research investigating healthcare workforce issues in Lebanon and support evidence-based planning for health human resources. They may inform the development of national and local policies in the country, which address the human resources needs of the health care system to meet regional and national demands. Universities, professional syndicates, and nongovernmental organizations may leverage these findings to develop continuing education training and diplomas incorporating the competencies critical for the healthcare workforce.

J	Jamaluddin, A; Husin, NIM; Omar, N				Jamaluddin, Adibah; Husin, Nurul Izwah Mohd; Omar, Normah			THE ROLE OF MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING IN A TURNAROUND STRATEGY	ASIA-PACIFIC MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING JOURNAL			English	Article						Management accounting; management accounting practice; turnaround strategy		This paper investigates how management accounting (MA) was applied in a turnaround strategy to recover from a company's fragile business position. A case study at a Malaysian company, Care, that undergo a turnaround process is conducted to understand how the use of MA contributes to their turnaround process. While economic downturn is claimed to be the major causes of poor organisational performance, Care was in a financial distress situation before the economic crisis. More importantly, Care successfully recover their poor condition during the economic downturn with the use of MA techniques. This paper describes the way MA was utilised before, during and after the turnaround process. Prior to the economic crisis, MA was used merely to provide reports with no strategic focus. Failure to manage the cost and understand the change in the market has compromised their performance. It is during the turnaround phase that MA information was used to understand the company's current performance to devise a turnaround strategy, cost reduction and revenue generation. Concurrently, MA techniques which focused on quality was introduced. Consequently, better quality product at lower production cost contributes towards improving their financial performance. More sophisticated MA techniques were introduced post turnaround period to sustain their performance. This paper contributes toward demonstrating how MA facilitates the turnaround process while undergoing the economic crises. Concurrently, it helps to minimise the gap between MA theory and practice by describing the application of MA in a turnaround strategy.

In line with these researches, this research aims to exploit the results of these researches, and test them on strategy implementation. It assumes that strategic roles of middle managers could have a positive impact on successful strategy implementation and thus on the relationship between successful strategy implementation and organisational performance. This general hypothesis was tested among a representative sample of 364 large Tunisian companies involved in the upgrading program. The results of the application of structural equation methods show that facilitating adaptability, implementing deliberate strategy and championing alternatives, except synthesising information, has not only a direct effect on the successful strategy implementation, but also an indirect effect on the relationship between successful strategy implementation and organisational performance.

J	Jiang, W; Wang, LL; Chu, ZF; Ma, XF				Jiang, Wan; Wang, Linlin; Chu, Zhaofang; Ma, Xifang			How analyst recommendation change influences strategic change The moderating role of CEO power and board's informal hierarchy	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Institutional theory; CEO power; Strategic change; Analyst recommendation change; Board's informal hierarchy	FIRM PERFORMANCE; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; COMPENSATION; DISMISSAL	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how analyst recommendation change is associated with a firm's magnitude of strategic change. Design/methodology/approach - This study argues that unfavorable analyst recommendation change serves as a powerful external assessment that current strategies are inappropriate and that changes are needed. This study also incorporates the moderating roles of CEO power and board's informal hierarchy in the relationship between analyst recommendation change and firm's magnitude of strategic change. Results from a sample of 824 observations generally support our predictions. Findings - The findings of this study show that the greater the analysts downgrade for the company's stock, the larger the magnitude of strategic change will be made. This study also considers the moderating roles of CEO power and the clarity of board's informal hierarchy. In particular, the higher the CEO power, the weaker the relationship between analyst recommendation change and the magnitude of strategic change will be. The higher the clarity of board's informal hierarchy, the more positive the relationship between analyst recommendation change and the magnitude of strategic change will be. Originality/value - It extends research on the external predictors of strategic change by incorporating the role of unfavorable analyst recommendation change. In addition, it contributes to institutional theory by showing how external legitimacy pressure and internal corporate governance tool complement each other.

The effectiveness of using subterranean heat in a house in the Hokuriku region is examined by calculating heat extraction in summer and heat addition in winter. The main features of this research are as follows: (1) an earth tube system (total length approximately 125 m) is installed beside a house at a depth of 2 m to reduce excavation costs; (2) measurements are taken under the condition of a ventilation rate of 0.33times/h (ventilation air volume, approximately 260 m(3)/h), which represents a fresh air load reduction and (3) the sensible and latent heat of the heat extraction in summer and the heat addition in winter under Hokuriku climate conditions in Japan are analyzed. The thermal effect of an earth tube system in summer is larger than in winter. The peak in heat extraction by the earth tube system was -1722 MJ/month in July and the latent heat portion of -906 MJ/month has exceeded the sensible heat portion of -866 MJ/month.

Methodological and theoretical ground for the research is a systematic approach for studying social-economic and ecologic phenomena and processes under the market conditions. In order to solve some tasks, there are used several methods: abstract-logical method to determine the conception and methods of analysis and synthesis. The aim of the research is to study the models for innovation development of rural territories based on infrastructure development. Conclusions. Segregate scientific approaches to form the model of rural economy are ruralism and neoruralism. Ruralism is a way of thinking and idea representing ruralisation in the human community, the development of which is focused on securing food supply and needs of those who live and work in rural areas. Neoruralism is a multifunctional social-economic system, which is focused on broadening of powers for united territorial communities. The rural economy here is an open system, focused on securing rural inhabitants welfare. The idea that agricultural changes in terms of modern tendencies and effective models of rural development, especially in the sphere of agricultural modernization, as a ground for its sustaining power, improvement of competitive ability for agricultural production and to meet the WTO Ukrainian member requirements is proved. Strategic benchmarks for Ukrainian rural areas in accordance with the requirements of Europe 2020 strategy are smart development - balanced development of the economy and social sphere; constant development - abide by scientifically proved norms; inclusive development - taking into consideration social standards for development. Special institutions determining law institutional mechanism of innovation development are very important for the revival of rural areas and infrastructure development.

Generally, a company chooses to support a particular community according to the company's strategic topic. This top-down approach benefits the company in many ways including effective operations and communications. However, the effectiveness on sustainable development of communities is still questionable. As each strategic topic is heavily influenced by the company's reasoning, this approach often lacks in dimensions, has narrow focus, and therefore disconnects with the community real needs. This results in little contributions to the sustainability of the communities. This proposal proposes a different approach through a case study with two artisanal fishery communities. With this new approach, the company acted as a bridging organization working closely with the communities together with other stakeholders to truly understand their needs. The company, then, facilitated them in designing and implementing their own sustainable solutions. This requires changes in the company operations as well as acquiring new knowledge for its outreach team. The findings demonstrated a successful case of community development towards self-sustainable resource management. The analysis of these findings helps the company to strike a balance between "company-centric" and "community-centric" approach in the future.

J	Karabaza, I; Kozhukhova, T				Karabaza, Iryna; Kozhukhova, Tetiana			OVERCOMING CORRUPTION AS THE BASIS OF EFFECTIVE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						responsibility; corruption; sustainable economic development; society; governance		The purpose of the paper is to substantiate the means of overcoming corruption in order to ensure effective state governance and sustainable economic development of the country. Methodology. The research is based on a systematic approach to studying aspects of overcoming corruption as a basis for effective public administration and sustainable economic development of the country. The following methods are used: the method of induction (while determining the impact of corruption on society); the method of analysis (while determining the means for effective fight against corruption); synthesis (while generalizing the main causes of corruption in Ukraine), the method of hypotheses (while determining ways to support effective public administration in Ukraine). Results. The destructive effects of corruption are considered at two levels: at the state level (national level) and at the level of citizen (personal level). The state is formed by people, and their tolerance to corruption depends on their value systems and a vital position formed by society and family. The one can fight against corruption effectively, first of all, by forming the competence of "responsibility" in the citizens of the country, that is, their conscious attitude to the requirements of society, the ability to be responsible for their own lives and actions. Anti-corruption tools are investigated at the state level and at the level of personality formation. Effective governance under the influence of corruption pressure not only prevents the country from developing in a normal way, inhibiting foreign investment and reducing national wealth, but also activating the migration outflow of a responsible part of the population, the best part of the national gene pool, thereby destroying the nation. The fight against corruption at the state level should begin with the fight against corruption at the level of education of the individual, first of all, by forming the competence of the "responsibility" in the citizens of the country, that is, their conscious attitude to the requirements of society, the ability to be responsible for their own lives and actions. Practical implications. Using global experience in the fight against corruption, the following strategic measures are proposed: government data and information on tax revenues, as well as on funds from international organizations should be freely used by citizens (Ukrainian ministries' websites contains no transparent and detailed data); create an active forum for government officials, civil society, private sector leaders, and other members of "Anticorruption Initiatives", which will provide an opportunity to fight against corruption and protect interests of the population in many areas, including the most risky, such as medical procurement; publish all data on public expenditure on the Open Government Portal - the data warehouse of world-wide budgets created by the World Bank Group; to create information and technological infrastructure that will allow the widespread use of electronic services (from the payment of taxes through the Internet to filling out the prescriptions of doctors); provide the opportunity to send instant text messages from citizens' mobile phones to a specified address in order to provide feedback, submitting suggestions, or reporting a problem related to public services. Value/originality. The means of overcoming corruption are substantiated in order to ensure effective public administration and sustainable economic development of the country.

The article is devoted to the development of methodological approaches to the strategic management of the development of transport and logistics clusters, which take into account opportunities and barriers, especially the domestic economic environment, as well as the specifics of certain types of economic activity. Methods. The economic and mathematical model is substantiated using the Savage criterion, which gives an opportunity to choose the optimal strategy of transport and logistics cluster development in the domestic conditions of management taking into account the different expectations of business entities. Methods similar to the Wald, Bayesian and Savage criteria were used for choosing optimal strategies in decision making theory and optimization problems of the following types were solved: when the distribution of states of the environment is unknown and assumed to be the most unfavourable; when it is known empirical expected distribution of environmental conditions and that is the average expected performance level for each indicator's group; when it is known expected division of the priorities of the decision-making entity that is the average expected level of financial (organizational, etc.) support for a certain group of indicators. Results. Four types of "clean" cluster development strategies are identified and described, which can be used in various combinations by transport and logistics companies. The economic and mathematical model of the transport and logistics cluster performance is presented, which allows implementing a large number of combinations of types of cluster development strategy by taking economic, environmental, social and innovative measures, affecting different groups of performance indicators. The influence of all possible variants of the binary and ternary combination of different types of transport and logistics cluster development strategies on the cluster performance is considered. It is established that the greatest influence on the transport and logistics cluster performance is exerted by the combination of economic and innovative types of strategy. Practical significance. Given the interest of entrepreneurs in cluster forms of organization and the strengthening of cooperation with EU countries, present development promotes scientific approaches to modelling cluster development strategies in the economy of Ukraine. Relevance/originality. The developed simulation model increases the likelihood of implementing the most optimal combination of clean" development strategies, contributes to a more accurate prediction of cluster development and as a methodological approach can be applied to various types of economic activity.

The multiple strategic options and their evaluation are part of the management process of a telecommunications company, and they aim to maximise the effectiveness of the organisation and improve its competitive position. The different perspectives of higher and middle management employees regarding the use and the usefulness of such strategies have to be taken into account and an extra effort should be made in order to align those perspectives and increase the consistency of the organisational practices. The current study aims to detect any possible gaps and issues on the perceptions of higher and middle management employees and to suggest possible and necessary actions that can ensure the effectiveness of the application of management strategies and their effect on strategic development.

J	Khalid, W; Herbert-Hansen, ZNL				Khalid, Waqas; Herbert-Hansen, Zaza Nadja Lee			Using k-means clustering in international location decision	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC SOURCING			English	Article						International location decision; K-mean; Clustering; Machine learning; Facility location; Supply chain; Offshoring	DESIGN; RISK	Purpose This paper aims to investigate the application of unsupervised machine learning in the international location decision (ILD). This paper addresses the need for a fast, quantitative and dynamic location decision framework. Design/methodology/approach Unsupervised machine learning technique, i.e. k-means clustering, is used to carry out the analysis. In total, 24 different indicators of 94 countries, categorized into five groups, have been used in the analysis. After the clustering, the clusters have been compared and scored to select the feasible countries. Findings A new framework is developed based on k-means clustering that can be used in ILD. This method provides a quantitative output without personal subjectivity. The indicators can be easily added or extracted based on the preferences of the decision-makers. Hence, it was found out that the unsupervised machine learning, i.e. k-means clustering, is a fast and flexible decision support framework that can be used in ILD. Research limitations/implications Limitations include the generality of selected indicators and clustering algorithm used. The use of other methods and parameters may lead to alternate results. Originality/value The framework developed through the research intends to assist the decision-makers in deciding on the facility locations. The framework can be used in international and national domains. It provides a quantitative, fast and flexible way to shortlist the potential locations. Other methods can also be used to further decide on the specific location.

J	Kianous, A; Karimzadegan, H				Kianous, Atoosa; Karimzadegan, Hasan			The effect of strategic management to minimize pollution for oil refinery (the case of Tehran oil refinery)	UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						strategic management; SWOT method; oil refining processes; Tehran refinery		With increasing rates of pollution in major cities, the various concerns that arise from implementing an environmental project are on the rise, while large industries such as oil refining often have adverse effects on the environment. Therefore, the present study examines the effects of strategic management on pollution reduction caused by oil refining processes. This is a descriptive-case study. A practical purpose was conducted in year 2017. The realm of Tehran Oil Refinery Research, and the statistical population of this research, consisted of senior experts, group presidents, and refinery managers employed in the Tehran Oil Refinery, which numbered 35 people. This study, based on cluster sampling. The Delphi method was used to design and prepare the questionnaire. The questionnaires were used to identify and weigh the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The validity of the questionnaire was verified using Lavshe method and the reliability of the questionnaire was obtained using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, which was approved. Identification and analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats were performed based on SWOT. In the final analysis, Friedman test was used to determine the significance of each item. All information was analyzed by SPSS software version 18 and the best strategy was determined using a quantitative evaluation matrix. According to the findings of the study, the existence of a strategic plan in the refinery could reduce the pollution from oil refining processes in the Tehran refinery, occupational diseases due to the lack of appropriate protective equipment for Tehran refinery workers. Future development of the plans could reduce pollution from refinery processes in Tehran refinery and destruction of vegetation and land degradation. Strategic management and SWOT approach can be used by using internal capabilities and strengths to exploit foreign opportunities, eliminate internal weaknesses and avoid external threats.

J	Kloppers, E				Kloppers, Elbe			AN INTEGRATED MODEL FOR COMMUNICATING WITHIN AND ABOUT CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY	COMMUNICATIO-SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL FOR COMMUNICATION THEORY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						development communication; communication for social change; corporate communication; corporate social responsibility; corporate social responsibility communication	CSR COMMUNICATION; PUBLIC-RELATIONS; INVOLVEMENT; ENGAGEMENT; STRATEGY	Corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives have two main objectives, namely, contributing to sustainable development; and adding strategic value for organisations. These objectives imply that organisations should communicate about CSR initiatives with stakeholders to add strategic value, whilst also communicating within CSR with the beneficiaries of these initiatives to contribute to sustainable development. In the field of CSR communication, however, the majority of the literature focuses on communication about CSR, while communication with the beneficiaries within CSR is often overlooked. This article presents an integrated model for communication both within and about CSR initiatives. The constructs of such integrated communication are analysed in order to identify similarities and point out differences. The ultimate aim is to present a holistic model for CSR communication that covers the content, nature and aims of such communication. The model is based on a literature study involving the two-way symmetrical approach, the reflective paradigm, strategic communication management and the participatory approach to communication for social change. Integrating communication within and about CSR in a single model is a complex undertaking, which entails incorporating constructs of communication from diverse theoretical fields flowing from different meta-theoretical assumptions. To date, this model is the first attempt to integrate communication within and about CSR on a theoretical level.

J	Kocyigit, M; Kucukcivil, B				Kocyigit, Murat; Kucukcivil, Busra			Investigation oldie Relationship between Marketing Purpose Sponsorship Activities and Consumer Based Brand Equity: Consumer Research on a Turkish Brand	CONNECTIST-ISTANBUL UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SCIENCES			Turkish	Article						Sponsorship; brand equity; marketing; brand awareness; brand loyalty		Sponsorship activities, which are a strategic public relations practice in today's competitive marketplace where capital wars are held, are used by brands for various communication aims. These aims are in the form of public relations, advertisement, and marketing. The aim of this research was to determine whether there is a significant relationship between sponsorship activities for marketing purposes and brand equity, and the direction and strength of this relationship. In this study, the scale expressions were fictionalized based on the sponsorship of National Teams of Arcelik brand. 412 people were surveyed using a questionnaire technique on the subject of brand equity. Accordingly, the meaning and strengths of the relations between data and variables, and the underlying hypotheses were tested. Firstly, the demographic variables of the participants were explored. Correlation and simple linear regression analyses were then performed to measure the relationship and the level of effect between sponsorship activities for marketing purposes and brand equity sub-dimensions. According to the research findings, it was established that there is a significant (p= ,000) and moderate impact relationship between sponsorship activities for marketing purposes and brand equity sub-dimensions ('brand loyalty', 'perceived quality', 'brand association/awareness', 'general brand equity'). Additionally, it was confirmed that as a result of simple linear regression analysis, sponsorship activities for marketing purposes have a direct and significant impact on brand equity sub-dimensions.

J	Kornienko, G; Chabanenko, M; Leheza, Y				Kornienko, Ganna; Chabanenko, Mykola; Leheza, Yulia			ASSESSMENT OF THE ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY OF IT APPLICATION AT ENTERPRISES	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						information technologies; CIS of the enterprise; IT development trends; problems of IT introduction; assessment of IT efficiency; assessment of costs; assessment of IT application; Black-Scholes-Merton model		The article covers theoretical aspects of the necessity of information technologies' introduction and development at the enterprise. There was substantiated the importance of the introduction of modern information technologies and their influence on the effective activity of the enterprise. There were generalized the conditions and consequences of technologies introduction, the main trends of IT development at enterprises, and possibilities of modern technologies use. The composite analysis of the methods for assessing the efficiency of information technology use conducted made it possible to compile the methods into three groups (methods of financial analysis, methods of qualitative analysis, methods of predictive analysis) and to distinguish their characteristics and possibilities of use. There were considered the most popular structural modules of the corporate information and technological system (CIS) in the world.There was the generalized structural composition of the ERP-system with MRP, SRM, CRM, and CSRM modules.There were determined the main characteristics of IT systems, advantages and disadvantages of integrated CRM modules customer relationship management system, BI data analysis systems (SAP, Microsoft Dynamics AX, Oracle BI systems), communication management system with SRM providers; 1C: Enterprise 8 - system of bookkeeping and management accounting use and the possibility of their association in CIS as: CSRP Enterprise Resource Planning System (Customer Synchronized Resource Planning). Resource planning technologies are functionally related in such a system, modules of CRM strategies are integrated, interaction with buyers and customers and bookkeeping analysis and accounting are synchronized. The method of economic efficiency determination with the improvement of calculation algorithm is proposed. The main stages of assessing the effectiveness of IT introduction and application at the enterprise can be summarized in three stages: preparation - analysis and assessment of the technology selection; introduction - analysis and assessment of direct costs and substantiation of expediency; implementation - assessment of economic efficiency of application and calculation of intellectual depreciation and possible stepwise modernization of information technology in future. The multiplicity of introduction goals and sources of IT payback requires a differentiated approach to the determination of the criteria for their effectiveness assessment. There was developed an algorithm of determination of the economic efficiency of IT introduction in the activity of the enterprise. The traditional way of profit assessing from the IT introduction does not ensure full consideration of qualitative and strategic efficiency, therefore, it requires additional use of predictive methods that allow supplementing quantitative calculations. The author proposed to calculate the efficiency of introduction, modernization, and use of IT projects, use of scenarios analysis methods, which include the Black-Scholes model and the binomial model for calculating the effectiveness of real options. The author considers the application of the Black-Scholes-Merton model to be the most expedient because, in contrast to the binomial one, it is easier to use but allows obtaining a result with minimal errors, without significant time costs close to the definitions of the binomial model. The use of such a model has already proven effective not only when calculating the effectiveness of real options, but there are also positive results of the study when using them in other areas of analysis. We consider it economically feasible to use methods determined by the author to assess economic efficiency of IT use.

J	Kulander, M				Kulander, Maria			Moving later in life - preferences and opportunity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS			English	Article						Life cycle; Elderly; Demography; Social housing; Stated preference; Adapted housing	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; HOUSING DECISIONS; RESIDENTIAL-MOBILITY; PROBIT MODELS; IMPACT; DEMAND; LOGIT; COSTS; CYCLE; HOME	Purpose Statistics from Eurostat show that several European countries have an increasing proportion of elderly people, making their housing situation of increasing interest. For many years, it has been policy in Sweden to help elderly people remain in their current homes for as long as possible. This paper aims to find reasons why people want to move at different stages in life and investigate whether the pattern follows the life cycle in housing. Earlier research has been performed in the USA (Gibler and Clements III, 2011) and in China (Jia and Heath, 2016), but these questions remain understudied in Sweden. Design/methodology/approach A model of the demand for adapted houses is designed and tested on data gathered in Gavle in 2012. The method uses a binary choice model with stated preference data. Findings The results of this study show that earlier preferences and age determine the future living situation, but that senior living (rental or condominium) is most popular as a future home. Practical implications Not everyone has the economic resources to move according to their preferences; reasons include high monthly costs and taxes. Changes in the tax system may produce better moving chains and increase the supply of affordable housing. Originality/value The model in this paper could guide future studies within the area.

J	Laari-Salmela, S; Mainela, T; Pernu, E; Puhakka, V				Laari-Salmela, Sari; Mainela, Tuija; Pernu, Elina; Puhakka, Vesa			Strategic practices of subsidiary positioning in business networks	IMP JOURNAL			English	Article						Positioning; MNC; Business network; Subsidiary; Strategic practices	MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS; AS-PRACTICE; PERSPECTIVE; COMPANIES; OUTSIDERSHIP; CHALLENGES; LIABILITY; TOOLS; MODEL; MNC	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine subsidiary positioning within the dynamic business networks in the context of multinational companies (MNCs). The research question of the study is: How does the positioning of a subsidiary emerge through strategic practices in the dynamic business networks of an MNC? Design/methodology/approach The study relies on the IMP view on strategy with a focus on market positioning activity and the strategy-as-practice approach. Positioning is seen as a question of strategic practices in the interactive spheres of the subsidiaries. In the empirical part of the study, the authors examine the practices of a forest machine industry multinational through longitudinal interview and archival data on three of its sales subsidiaries in Sweden, Russia and the USA. Findings The study defines core tensions in subsidiary interactive spheres and the related strategic practices that shape the positioning of the subsidiaries. The study models the practice-based network positioning of MNC subsidiaries as a dynamic play of relationship tensions. Originality/value Prior research has focused either on the internal organizing of the MNCs or embeddedness of subsidiaries in their local environment. Less attention has been paid to the practices of positioning through which the subsidiaries deal with the inevitable tensions at the intersection of the internal and external networks.

J	Landsberg, T; Wiggill, MN				Landsberg, Tersia; Wiggill, Magrita Nicolene			RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT WITH MANAGERS OF COUNTRYWIDE OFFICES OF SEESA: A CASE STUDY	COMMUNICATIO-SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL FOR COMMUNICATION THEORY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						relationship management; internal communication; strategic communication and relationship management; national organisations; regional offices	INTERNAL COMMUNICATION; SATISFACTION	Employees are a crucial stakeholder group for organisations since they determine the degree to which they achieve their goals. It is therefore necessary to build strong relationships with the workforce to encourage employee engagement, which implies that employees' individual goals are aligned to those of the organisation. To build strong relationships, internal communication should be managed strategically. However, when an organisation has offices around the country, internal relationship management can be impeded, which adversely affects the entity attaining its goals. In this qualitative study, the case of SEESA, a national labour law organisation specialising in providing legal services to employers, was investigated to determine the way in which it manages relationships with its nationwide managers. A mixed-method approach was followed, using semi-structured interviews and questionnaires to gather data. The findings indicated that, despite studies elsewhere indicating a communication and relationship building strategy as a prerequisite for building strong organisation-employee relationships, the outcomes of such relationships can be present without a formal internal communication strategy. This can occur provided the organisation is inclined towards a symmetrical world view, has an open culture and encourages two-way communication with top management. Suggestions for managing relationships with employees in nationwide offices are made.

This study explores micro-scale spatial dynamics of the ratio for houses at the individual property level in Seoul, South Korea. We match the apartment unit sold and the one leased based on the carefully chosen criteria and apply a Bayesian multi-level modeling approach to this matched dataset. We employ the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) algorithm in order to estimate relevant parameters in the multi-level model. The ratio determinants found in the study include property age, apartment unit area, interest rate, and floor. This study also presents the importance of taking into account the hierarchical structure of apartment units, as well as seasonal and spatial variations when estimating the ratio and predicting future trends in the property market based on the ratio.

J	Lestari, F				Lestari, Febrianti			Pollution Charges and Assimilation Capacity in Tanjungpinang Bay Area, Riau Islands Province, Indonesia	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION			English	Article						Pollution load; assimilation capacity of the waters; the Tanjungpinang bay area	WATER-QUALITY; MANAGEMENT; MANGROVE; SEAGRASS	The Tanjungpinang bay at Riau Islands Province is one of coastal areas that have a high level pollution load due to the increased scale of economic activities and also rapid community activities are increased dynamically. Hence carrying out a research which aim for knowing the pollution load and the assimilation capacity determination in Tanjungpinang bay area have a very strategic position. This study is based on survey method through the observation techniques in the field for distinguishing variables with the parameters set by purposive sampling. The data were analyzed to produce the charts which describe the relationship between each parameter with the total pollution load in estuaries. The results explain the pollution load into the Tanjungpinang bay area which includes parameters of TSS, BOD5, COD, NO3, NO2, NH4 and PO4-P respectively amounted to 397.369 tons/year, 20.858 tons/year, 791 079 tons/year, 1.156 tons/year, 824 tons/year, 1.115 tons/year and 606 tons/year. While the Tanjungpinang bay area assimilation capacity for each parameter above amounted to 689 960 tons/year, 67.062 tons/year, 640.930 tons/year, -89 tones/year, -9 tons/year, 1.145 tons/year and -12 tons/year. This shows that the pollution load to the parameters COD, NO3, NO2 and PO4-P has exceeded the carrying capacity of the waters.

J	Lin, JH; Li, XL; Huang, FW				Lin, Jyh-Horng; Li, Xuelian; Huang, Fu-Wei			Insurer interest margin management, default risk, and life insurance policyholder protection	JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Finance; Banking	BARRIER OPTION FRAMEWORK; MARKET VALUE; LIABILITIES; VALUATION; CONTRACTS; POLICIES; SCHEMES; IMPACT	Purpose This paper aims to theoretically examine the effects of regulatory policyholder protection on spread behavior and default probability of a life insurance company. Design/methodology/approach The authors construct a contingent claim model for the valuation of the equity of a life insurance company. Then, they extend it to model default risk measures associated with a more appropriate behavioral mode of strategic invested asset rate-setting under regulation. Findings The findings established that the optimal insurer interest margin is explicitly modeled by a spread between the loan rate and the required guaranteed rate of the company. The effect of the guaranteed rate on the insurer interest margin is positive when the barrier is low, whereas it is negative when the barrier is high. As the barrier increases, the positive effect of the guaranteed rate on the default risk is increased, the negative effect of the participation on the insurer interest margin is decreased and the positive effect of the participation on the default risk is decreased. Practical implications Several results derived that should be of interest to investors, analysts, supervising agencies and policymakers. For example, policyholders protected by increasing the guaranteed rate may create a higher risk for the life insurance company to meet its obligations. Originality/value The authors' approach is a significant departure from the existing literature; they differentiate among path-dependent, barrier options and suggest that the life insurance company's defaults are more commonly triggered by regulatory responses than debt default.

J	Liu, GX; Ye, J				Liu, Guoxin; Ye, Jun			Intelligent selection of strategic alliance partners in automobile manufacturing industry based on DEA and grey system theory	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Strategic alliance; DEA; grey prediction model; automobile manufacturing		Since the 1980s, the number of international strategic alliances has been on the rise and the alliance has become a novel mode of corporate growth. Therefore, the selection of strategic partners has always been relevant to the fulfillment of strategic objectives of a corporation. Since the conflicts among partners' motivations can easily lead to the breakup of a strategic alliance, the pursuit of an appropriate strategic partner has become essential to the success of an enterprise. This paper mainly conducts a case study on the French auto-manufacturer Renault with the grey system theory and DEA analysis. Relevant data from Bloomberg BusinessWeek of 2015 have been studied, and the data concerns 19 auto-manufacturers including Group Renault in four consecutive fiscal years from 2012 to 2015. After the data analysis, an intelligent method of selecting appropriate strategic partners has been proposed. According to the intelligent method, among the 19 decision-making units on the list, Nissan Motor Company (DMU8) and Daimler AG (DMU3) are the most suitable strategic partners to form an alliance with Renault (DMU13).

The tendency of transport enterprises to ensure fluidity of supplies and reduce the costs of transport processes requires the use of innovative technologies, which allow companies to improve the control of transport services. Enterprises plan transport services to minimize the costs. Therefore, looking for and implementing new solutions, which have an impact on increasing the efficiency of transport processes, are driving forces for every transport company. In this article, the authors conducted an analysis of the process of providing transport services in a specific enterprise. The authors also show that transport processes may be improved through the implementation of innovative monitoring system.

J	Machacek, E; Fold, N				Machacek, Erika; Fold, Niels			Competitors contained? Manufacturer strategies in the global rare earth value chain: Insights from the magnet filament	EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Rare-earth magnets; Global value chains; Governance; Codification; EU-China	MODULAR PRODUCTION NETWORKS; ECONOMIC-GEOGRAPHY; GOVERNANCE	This paper connects the extractive industry of rare earth mining and processing with the global automotive industry in which magnets with rare earth content are key components. In the context of the hardly uncontested market leadership in rare earth mining by China, the strategies of second-tier European rare-earth magnet manufacturers warrant examination: they compete with their third-tier Chinese suppliers and aim for a favourable position with first-tier suppliers to automotive end-users. We use the governance typologies of the global value-chain framework to elucidate how European magnet manufacturers strategize and employ the 'ability to codify' variable. Codification significantly determines how global value chains are governed and who gains from access to and use of mined and processed rare earths: Our findings pinpoint the strategic use of information flows and knowledge by manufacturers to their competitive advantage in the magnet filament towards the automotive industry. Therefore we propose a focus on 'intention to codify' in exploring deliberately managed information flows for global economic restructuring processes. Such focus will provide a more holistic understanding of the global rare earth value chain and its many filaments.

The obvious relevance is topics of the scientific and technological development. The high importance of these issues for Russia is the aspects of the stated problems debatable and uncovered in the scientific literature determined our choice for research. This paper analyzes the main conceptual vectors in the strategic course of scientific and technological development of the Russian presented. Prioritized tasks have been systemized; principal directions of state policy in the scientific and technological sphere, defining the upper profile of the state strategic planning system are systematized. The factors preventing sustainable development in the context or the "science-business" model are revealed. The tools promo support of national scientific interests in the global market, mechanis of interaction and strengthening of the ties between science, business and the state based on their interdependence, are presented. The role of science and innovations in providing an effective system of building and intellectual potential as a condition for a sustainable future of the nation is considered. The importance of the popularization f science, the prestige scientists in the creation and enhancement of the country's intellectual potential is emphasized. (C) 2018 INT TRANS J ENG MANAG SCI TECH.

This requires the development of an optimized biomass procurement strategy that can adjust to new material demands at the mill. The new procurement strategy must adapt to changes in current production as well as the potential start-up of new processes to expand the firm's product portfolio. In this study, an MILP model was developed and used to evaluate the integrated procurement of both wood chips and residual materials (hog fuel) from forest harvesting operations to a pulp and paper mill. The model seeks to satisfy the mill's long-term feedstock requirements while minimizing procurement cost. It considers the wide variability of materials obtained from the surrounding boreal forest and additional partners such as sawmills operating in the same areas. It also examines the impacts of changing from existing cut-to-length harvesting systems to a better-suited full-tree system that produces both wood chips and hog fuel at lower cost. An industrial case study in an Eastern Canadian newsprint mill was used to develop and validate the model. A detailed description of results for one year of optimization is presented to validate the model with historical data. In addition, results for the evaluated 20-year time horizon are presented. The optimized solution suggests that a reduction of up to 28% in biomass cost is possible. Furthermore, the scenario where harvesting contractors exchanged their cut-to-length harvesting equipment for a full-tree system reduced biomass costs by an additional 8%.

J	Mendoza, RL				Mendoza, Roger Lee			Health risk, price efficiency, and airline seat size regulation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Aircraft; Autonomy; Nash equilibrium; Passenger health and safety; Paternalism; Payoff; Risk	COST	Purpose: Airline cost-cutting measures have led to shrinking economy-class seats ever since deregulation went into effect 35 years ago. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, along with restricted mobility, particularly during an emergency evacuation, are among the health and safety hazards seat shrinkage has created for passengers. These have led to several regulatory attempts to define and standardize minimum aircraft seat dimensions. The question for scholarly investigation is whether government can efficiently regulate how air travelers value their health, safety, and comfort (and what consequences might arise therefrom). Methods: Aircraft seat regulation is modeled as a Stag Hunt with two sets of utility-maximizing and interactive players: passengers and airlines. The strategic choices available to each one are identified and tested in the context of a single-play game. Main findings: We find two likely outcomes of passenger and airline risk calculations and mitigation strategies against a set of alternatives and their expected consequences. The tension between the payoff-dominant and risk-dominant equilibria arises when players rationally pursue either strategy, depending on what they expect the other will do. Despite the lower payoffs to either player, we predict that the second-best and risk-dominant strategy will result from players' risk calculations. Successful lobbying against airline seat regulation derives not so much from the vast resources and efforts committed to it, but from the demonstrable power of market forces to sustain it. Conclusion/value: Absent any optimal strategy to address corresponding price increases, regulatory efficacy will depend on the risk propensities of market forces. Aircraft seat pricing reflects consumer supply and demand information pertaining to it. Any information changes will be instantly reflected in the market price of aircraft seats. Game simulation thus offers empirically verifiable predictions about choices that affect the control of scarce resources, particularly when passengers and airlines compete over them under conditions of risk and uncertainty.

Our empirical results provide evidence that this scenario of superior independence has no effect on audit quality. Moreover, auditors accepting their appointment by the Mercantile Registry tend to be more permissive than the rest and did not show different attitudes towards the audited company depending on whether their appointment is made by the public Registry or directly by the firm's board of directors. We also found that auditors appointed by the Mercantile Registry show a marked tendency to issue reports with modified opinions.

FACTORS INFLUENCING THE BUSINESS SUCCESS: A SURVEY OF STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES OF MERGER PROCESS	POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Strategic Leadership; Empowerment; Motivation; Business Success		This research wants to test and analyze the impact of strategic leadership toward business success on three state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that are in the process of merging. These three companies will be merged and they will become one of the world class holding companies. The type of this research is a survey using questionnaire and interview with the key manager that can represent the company. Population and respondents are the managers of three state-owned enterprises who have direct involvement on changing program and act as the agent of change. The sampling technique uses stratified proportional area random sampling. The data analysis technique uses Partial Least Square. The result is that: (1) the strategic leadership can improve empowerment and work motivation of the manager, (2) the empowerment can increase work motivation of manager and company business success and (3) the company business will be able to increase as the manager work motivation increases. On the other side, this research finding is surprising because strategic leadership is perceived cannot affect the company business success in the future. It seems that there are excessive worries toward company business failure in the future.	[Muafi; El Qadri, Z. M.; Harjito, D.

J	Mutsagondo, S				Mutsagondo, Samson			Post-records survey inspections in Zimbabwe: Reflections on compliance and non-compliance with records survey recommendations	RECORDS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Records management; Gweru Records Centre; National Archives of Zimbabwe; Post-records survey inspections; Records surveys		Purpose This paper aims to establish public departments' compliance with National Archives of Zimbabwe (NAZ)'s records survey recommendations as well as to find out reasons for compliance and non-compliance. Design/methodology/approach This quantitative research used a survey research design and collected data using questionnaires, which were triangulated by document reviews and personal observation. A census approach was used where all 15 public departments upon which post-records survey inspections were conducted by Gweru Records Centre in the Midlands Province in 2016 were involved in the study. Findings The study revealed that many public departments in Zimbabwe disregarded records survey recommendations given by NAZ after records surveys. This was despite the fact that NAZ was armed with the National Archives of Zimbabwe Act (1986) which in principle is supposed to induce compliance by client departments. As a result, the records management situation in public departments has not improved much, and in some cases, it has become worse. Originality/value A lot has been published about records surveys in Zimbabwe, for example, by Chaterera (2008, 2013), Dewah (2010), Karimanzira and Mutsagondo (2015), Maboreke (2007) and Mutsagondo (2012). These studies have shown the importance of records surveys. However, none of them has evaluated the effectiveness of records surveys by examining the degree of compliance to records survey recommendations by public departments. This study thus scores a first in this regard. The study will enable NAZ to make a cost-benefit analysis of records surveys as well as to use results of this study to effect necessary operational, tactical and strategic decisions as regards the exercise.

J	Nastych, MA				Nastych, Maria A.			Analysis of Management Collusive Decisions on the World Oil Market	ROSSIISKII ZHURNAL MENEDZHMENTA-RUSSIAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			Russian	Article						world oil market; OPEC; collusion; stochastic cooperative game; C-alpha-core; VaR	STOCHASTIC COOPERATIVE GAMES; CARTEL; OPEC; OLIGOPOLY; MERGERS	The article examines the issue of the advantage and key conditions of collusion between the major oil exporting countries on the world oil market. This issue is explored in the paper within the framework of the concepts of stochastic cooperative game theory and the theory of industrial organisation. Namely, the concepts of game theory correspond to the conflicting interests of collusion participants. Next, the possibility of collusion between market players is considered and resolved using the theory of cooperative games. Stochastic methods of constructing and investigating the characteristic function of a cooperative game help to take into account the high volatility of the oil market. Further, the Cournot model of the theory of industrial organisation describes the strategic management of production volumes to maximize profits. The Stackelberg model takes into account the incentives to collude through the emergence of an industry leader, who first announces his management strategies. Based on these methodologies, the paper concludes that the collusion for its participants is beneficial, and the equilibrium levels of quotas for oil extraction are found.

This is seen as one of the strategic prerequisites for accelerating economic growth. The author considers it necessary to work without looking at the recipes of the "Washington Consensus" imposed from outside, noting that the practice of many developing countries has not justified the validity of such recipes. The study confirms the emergence of the basic institutions of a market economy in the SRV and identifies obstacles that hamper the work, showing their insufficient strength and effectiveness. To improve the management system, it is proposed to seek its democratization, to master modern requirements and best practices, to focus on the future. Recommendations are formulated for this work, in particular, on stimulating innovation and creating "smart cities".

J	Nohong, M				Nohong, Mursalim			The moderating effect of efficiency and non-market capability in relationship between government involvement and resources to performance of water supply companies (PDAM) in Sulawesi, Indonesia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance; Efficiency; Resources; Government involvement; Non-market capability	STRATEGY; DETERMINANTS; ENVIRONMENT; GHANA; FIRM	Purpose This paper aims to investigate the moderating effect of efficiency and non-market capability in the relationship between government involvement and resources to performance of water supply companies (PDAM) in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach This paper is explanatory in nature, i.e. it explains the relationship (causality) between the external environment variables (government involvement), internal environment variables (resources and non-market capabilities) and the performance of taps in Sulawesi through hypothesis testing. The research was conducted in six provinces in the northern peninsula of Sulawesi Island: North Sulawesi Province, Gorontalo Province, Central Sulawesi Province, Southeast Sulawesi Province, South Sulawesi Province and West Sulawesi Province. The research was undertaken from September 2011 to December 2011. The analysis unit in this research was PDAM, while the research population was the regional water company (PDAM) in Sulawesi. A quantitative approach was used for data analysis, i.e. variance-based inferential statistical analysis with structural equation modeling, known as partial least squares, with variable non-market capability acting as a moderating variable. Findings Government involvement has a significant and positive effect on the performance, indicating that the higher the government involvement, the higher the performance of a company. Efforts to reduce water loss level for PDAM is a strategic move, as they are associated with PDAM's stakeholders. Water loss will lead to poor customer service, low contribution to the acceptance of regional governments and failure to meet natural conservation programs. On the other hand, to reduce the water loss level, considerable capital is needed for investment, for example, to finance the installation and repair of pipelines, pumps, mains water meter, customer water meter, the cost of water treatment, fuel costs and the expansion of the water source. In general, PDAM in Sulawesi still has problems in terms of expansion because of the lack of funding sources; hence, the role of regional government as the owner is expected, both in the form of financial aid and the tariff adjustment. The government should be in favor of thorough development of drinking water, as embodied in the form of finance, budget commitment and the commitment to the development of PDAM. Research limitations/implications The limitations of this study are that the data used in this study are cross-sectional, so they only describe the condition at a particular time. Also, the sample was limited to Sulawesi taps; therefore, to generalize the findings, a larger sample needs to be considered. Practical implications The practical implications of this study are that development of water supply company cannot be separated from the government's involvement as one of the stakeholders to improve corporate performance, especially through financial assistance. In connection with it, a board of directors or management of PDAM in every department of a company constantly works on government involvement, especially financial aid to fund or investment fund sharing, to improve service to customers. Such activities run a company aimed at achieving efficiency with emphasis on the efficiency of production and distribution capacity by managing the leakage rate, the emphasis on labor costs by keeping the ratio of employees ideal, the emphasis on aspects of the supply and distribution through control of water resources and water meter mains and water customers and an emphasis on the use of raw materials or chemicals with attention to the quality of raw water. Social implications The social implications of this study are that government interventions are supported by the availability of resources according to the needs able to create efficiencies that have an impact on improving the performance of taps. Companies performing well can operate optimally in providing drinking water that meets health standards. In addition, the performance achieved allows the taps to embody the organization's mission as a creator of jobs and local revenue for local governments. Originality/value Originality for this paper shows the moderating effect of efficiency and non-market capability in the relationship between government involvement and resources to PDAM. The originality also includes the location of this study (six provinces in the northern peninsula of Sulawesi Island: North Sulawesi Province, Gorontalo Province, Central Sulawesi Province, Southeast Sulawesi Province, South Sulawesi Province and West Sulawesi Province) as no previous research has investigated this relationship in this geography.

J	Ortiz, B; Donate, MJ; Guadamillas, F				Ortiz, Beatriz; Donate, Mario J.; Guadamillas, Fatima			Social capital and the identification of valuable knowledge for knowledge acquisition: a case study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						social capital; knowledge identification; knowledge acquisition; absorptive capacity; case study; Immunostep; Spain	ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; FIRM PERFORMANCE; NETWORKS; VIEW; CAPABILITIES; INNOVATION; CREATION	Immunostep is a biotechnological company which has developed an external knowledge acquisition strategy based on the utilisation of its social capital and its capability to recognise and assimilate valuable new knowledge for the improvement of its innovation capabilities. The main advantages that social capital management provide to this company are: (1) the development of strong and close ties with other firms and institutions for the purposes of knowledge exchange (development of structural social capital), (2) the achievement of a high reliability in its business relationships (development of relational social capital), and (3) the establishment of compatible objectives and shared cultural values with a number of external agents (development of cognitive social capital). In turn, this case study shows that the way social capital is strategically managed by a firm is an essential aspect for the successful development of knowledge acquisition. Moreover, the success of the integration and use of the knowledge acquired depends strongly on the firm's capability to correctly identify, assess, and anticipate the potential value of such external knowledge.

J	Park, SI; Seo, JH				Park, Sang Il; Seo, Joo Hwan			Does strategic orientation fit all? The effects of strategic orientation on high versus low-performing SMEs	ASIAN JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION			English	Article						Creating shared value; entrepreneurial orientation; moderation effect; firm performance; quantile regression	ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION; FIRM PERFORMANCE; CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; MARKET ORIENTATION; KNOWLEDGE; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES; FAMILY; IMPACT	This paper investigates the effects of a creating shared value (CSV) orientation as well as market and entrepreneurial orientation on small business performance. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) lack knowledge-based resources, because of limited business history, experience, and budgets. The effects of entrepreneurial orientation and CSV are examined from a resource-based view. Empirical evidence of the moderating effect of CSV and learning orientation on firm performance is lacking, especially in SMEs in South Korea. We collected 300 samples from SMEs, and analysed the data using quantile regression, which explores the effects of covariates at various quantile levels of a conditional distribution. This differs from previous studies on SMEs, which dealt with the conditional mean (ordinary least squares). The results confirm the significant and positive effects of CSV orientation on firm performance and that entrepreneurial orientation and the moderating effects of learning and CSV orientation are more effective for firms in the mid to upper quantiles in terms of performance. We also examined whether the effects of entrepreneurial and CSV orientation differ for firms with low and high performance using quantile regression. The results indicate that strategic orientations need to be different in low and high-performing businesses. The results address the heterogeneity of SME performance in strategic orientation analyses.

J	Pedraza, CC; Pagano, JP; Pescetto, C; Prieto, L				Pedraza, Camilo Cid; Pagano, Juan Pablo; Pescetto, Claudia; Prieto, Lorena			Fiscal space for sustainable financing of health systems and universal health	REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			Spanish	Article						Healthcare financing; health systems; taxes; health equity; efficiency; Americas	PUBLIC-HEALTH; COVERAGE; MORTALITY; INVESTMENT; IMPACT; INCOME	The articles published in this series show that it is possible to create fiscal space for health in the countries. This requires specific decisions since economic growth is not enough to generate the additional resources needed. The studies analyze the benefit of reviewing the tax expenditures to identify exemptions - generally outdated and of low benefit for the countries -; arguments to increase taxes on products harmful to health; and credits and donations, which do not result in a viable source of income for governments. Fiscal efforts must be accompanied by an improvement in efficiency, and the progressive creation of new revenues is key to improving equity. It is necessary to improve the collection of fiscal resources. To this end, it is necessary to develop a research and action agenda that understands the analysis of the fiscal space inserted in the processes of transformation and reform of health systems, including the technical aspects not yet addressed and studies of the social efficiency of the fiscal space for major development objectives such as the Sustainable Development Goals 2030. In the countries of the Region of the Americas it is essential to have efficient management to do more and better with more resources, even during adverse economic cycles. This should be evident at all levels, including solidarity for achieving better health outcomes, strategic purchase of health goods and services, and strengthening of budget planning systems.

J	Phornlaphatrachakorn, K				Phornlaphatrachakorn, Kornchai			Strategic Cost Management and Firm Profitability: An Empirical Investigation of Instant Foods and Convenience Foods Businesses in Thailand	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS			English	Article						strategic cost management; cost advantage; cost efficiency; cost leadership; firm profitability		This study aims at investigating the influences of strategic cost management on firm profitability of instant foods and convenience foods businesses in Thailand through mediators of cost advantage, cost leadership, and cost efficiency. In this study, 193 instant foods and convenience foods businesses in Thailand are the samples of the study. To test the research relationships, structural equation model (SEM) as a statistical technique is employed. Based on the results of the study, (1) strategic cost management has a positive influence on cost advantage, cost leadership, and cost efficiency, (2) cost advantage is positively related to cost leadership and cost efficiency and (3) cost efficiency positively affects firm profitability. Additionally, only cost efficiency is a mediator of the strategic cost management-firm profitability relationships. According to the research results, strategic cost management becomes a valuable approach that helps firms gain sustainable competitive advantage and achieve superior performance. Thus, executives of firms need to allocate their resources, assets, competencies, and capabilities in order to develop and utilize strategic cost management successfully in the rigorous competitive markets and environments.

J	Pokataiev, P; Matviichuk, O				Pokataiev, Pavlo; Matviichuk, Oleg			DEVELOPMENT VECTOR OF INFORMATISATION OF SOCIETY	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						investments; financing; public administration		The purpose of the paper is to cover the main moments of the state program of informatisation of society and on the basis of the sources used to propose a strategic vision of the further development of the information society in the context of its financing. Methodology. The survey is based on the analysis of the development of information society in Ukraine taking into account features of state policy in the field of informatisation. Laws and regulations that influence the national program of informatisation are outlined. The scientific material, which describes the processes of financing and implementation of the informatisation program, of domestic scientists is indicated. The direction of financing of the state program of informatisation of society in the context of integration into world processes is highlighted. The formation of conclusions and schemes of the vector of development of the information society is based on the research of scientific works and on the basis of our considerations in the context of the use of the intellectual potential of the citizens of the country. Results. The positive directions of foreign investments for funding the state program of informatisation of society, such as competition, innovations, accumulation of capital are outlined. On the example of one of the regions of Ukraine, the main problems are identified, which prevent to more quickly implement the National Program of lnformatisation. The way of ensuring national competitiveness and investment attractiveness is proposed, as a result of solving certain problem issues. The algorithm of actions in the form of a vector for the development of the information society, for the improvement of the sustainable development of the information society, is formed. Practical implications. Proposals for developing the information society can be implemented in the state policy of informatisation of state authorities and the country as a whole. The main scientific achievements of this article can be used in the national program of informatisation, which determines the short, medium, and longterm development of the information society in the context of the transformation of social, economic, ecological, scientific and technical, defence, and cultural activities in society at the national level. It is also possible to propose the main content of this scientific material to be used in the future addition of the Concept of the National Program of Informatisation, regional, sectoral programs of informatisation in the context of the management of the implementation of information technologies and programs and projects aimed at improving the infrastructure of the territorial community. Value/originality. Positive and negative tendencies of informatisation of society against the background of the active introduction of the state program of informatisation of society are presented; a scheme is proposed that represents the vector of the development of the information society. The main components of the interaction and growth of the information society are as follows: the negative factors, on the basis of which there is formed the further policy of public administration, tools that can be used in solving current and possible future problem issues, directions of infrastructure development for the implementation of opportunities of the information society, the division of responsibilities between the authorities depending on their resource capacity and maximum capacity to meet the needs of citizens.

J	Pontes, JP; Pais, J				Pontes, Jose Pedro; Pais, Joana			The role of infrastructure efficiency in economic development-The case of underused highways in Europe	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE POLICY AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						total factor productivity; efficiency in infrastructure use; economic development; transport economics		In this paper, we establish a two-way causality between the phenomenon of infrastructure which is underused (the so-called "white elephant case") and the aggregate productivity level (TFP) of the economy. On the one hand, the fact that a transport infrastructure is not used as much as it could be is itself a cause of low TFP because it represents low productivity for an important item of social capital. On the other hand, low aggregate productivity makes firms' strategies founded on large scale of production and exports riskier, given the possibility that the political decision to build the required transport infrastructure may never be taken.

We present what international trends can be observed in this area. In the course of our research, we primarily sought to find out how tax and financial changes affect the management of the companies/institutions and the cafeteria plans. Secondly, we examined connections between the external factors and internal features which influence the organization's decisions in the areas above mentioned.

J	Poynter, M; Ryan, M				Poynter, M.; Ryan, M.			Leadbeater's possum and Victoria's Central Highlands' forests: flawed science and environmental activism as drivers of forest management change	AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY			English	Article						conservation; timber harvesting; Leadbeater's possum; mountain ash; environmental campaigns; flawed science; activism	EUCALYPTUS-REGNANS; FIRE; SEVERITY; BIOMASS	Aspects of the scientific discipline of forestry have endured decades of environmental activism aimed at discrediting it. Much of this activism has entailed strategic avoidance of inconvenient truths while promoting myths, half-truths and pseudo-science as though they are absolute fact. However, arguably of greater concern are more recent instances of false or unsupported claims about native forest management contained in some conservation-focussed research published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.This paper examines recent scientific literature which addresses Leadbeater's possum and broader conservation issues in the forests of Victoria's Central Highlands. In assessing its contribution to the public and political discourse on forest management we identified the following six areas where much of this research is contentious: Leadbeater's possum population estimatesThe proportions of forests respectively catering for conservation or wood productionValue of active forest management strategies for conserving Leadbeater's possumForest carbon stocksThe concept of ecosystem collapseValue of environmental services derived from native forests.This contentious research is characterised by the omission of critically important context, reliance on flawed or wrong assumptions and errant citation practices. In the past, there would have been an expectation of such problems being identified and excluded during effective peer review by appropriate scientists. That this is no longer guaranteed is indicative of broken academic protocols.We conclude that there is evidence of a disturbing synergy between some peer-reviewed science and environmental activism in fashioning and promoting a questionable case for forest management changein this instance, through advocacy of a proposed new national park that would restrict or end a range of public activities and decimate a significant and sustainable local timber industry.

J	Proksch, D; Stranz, W; Pinkwart, A				Proksch, Dorian; Stranz, Wiebke; Pinkwart, Andreas			Risk types and risk assessment in venture capital investments: a content analysis of investors' original documents	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURING			English	Article						risk; risk assessment; risk management; venture capital; new technology-based firms; new ventures	STRATEGIC RISK; BUSINESS PLAN; MANAGEMENT; OWNERSHIP; FUNDS; FIRMS	Venture capital is an important resource for new ventures with no access to the capital market. However, venture capital companies' investment decisions could be extremely risky. Assessing and managing risk is therefore a major task of venture capital companies. Despite the topic's high practical relevance, there is very little literature in this field. We aim to extend the academic discussion by investigating the risk types and risk assessment in venture capital investments. We analysed more than 500 deal documents of nine German venture capital companies, resulting in 2,452 qualitative quotes. We categorised these quotes into seven risk types, namely financial, market, strategy, technology, production, human capital, and legal risks, implying their relevance during the VC investment process. Market risk and technology risk are mentioned the most in the due diligence and the decision papers.

THE BALANCE BETWEEN FORMAL AND INFORMAL MANAGERIAL PRACTICES - MANAGING AMBIDEXTERITY IN CREATIVE INDUSTRIES	POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						ambidexterity; paradox theory; strategy; relations; CI		The main aim of the paper is to understand how managers of creative industries (CI) decide on the use of ambidextrous solutions. Managerial actions of business managers of CI enable to connect the volatility and variability of the environment with the high level of creativeness that this requires. As such, it is interesting to study how these managerial actions are decided is of utmost importance, especially in a volatile and subjective environmental context as it seems to be the one of CI (Banks et al., 2000). We aim at investigating the managerial practices that enable to find the balance between the simultaneous pressure on innovativeness and the effectiveness of the actions taken. We wanted to know the way managers deal with the paradoxes that can result. We interviewed managers of 10 companies located in a second tier group of countries, where for governments, CI are apparently strategic, but where the value they add and the jobs they can create can still be improved. Results show that there are two main paradoxes in terms of managerial actions - the priority in relations (external or internal) and the approach to strategy (flexibility or planned actions). Results also show that in what concerns strategy formality and external priority in relations there are consistencies in the degree of strategy formalization. However, in what concerns the practices used in shaping the internal relations, there is no consistency identified in our sample. Our overall conclusions are that companies are more and more moving away from the traditional option of informal approach, focused inward to a more hybrid approach in which formal focus outward is also considered. This confirms the thesis that ambidexterity is becoming a characteristic of the companies in the CI sector.

A Design of Experiments Methodology for Evaluating Configuration for a Generation Next Main Battle Tank	DEFENCE SCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Article						Configuration; Evolutionary design; Revolutionary design; Regression; Systems		Combat vehicles for generation next main battle tank requires state-of-the-art technologies to counter advanced threats both from conventional and un-conventional sources across various theatres of operation. In addition, they require strategic mobility by road, rail, air and sea. Under such conditions, the trend across the world has been to converge on configurations that are lethal, agile, modular systems and interchangeable mission based turret configurations along with higher survivability which imposes limitations on mobility as mass increases. To achieve all the user objectives as laid down in the qualitative requirements, it is prudent to focus the attention on weight management. The traditional approach of weight management is time consuming, for which an alternate approach using design of experiments is proposed in this paper. To carry out this study, two configurations are selected namely evolutionary and revolutionary design. Keeping the outer boundary as the constraint, a simple linear regression and analysis of variance are carried out with mass and volume data from various systems and sub-systems. Subsequently, the accuracy of the analysis is ascertained using a test of hypothesis using PHStat software. Although this study discusses configuration, the factors responsible for reduced system mass and volume namely technology, materials, intelligence etc have not been discussed. Finally, from the outcome of the study it is observed that the revolutionary design configuration fares better compared to the evolutionary design configuration with a combat mass of only 41 t.

A significant number of waqf institutions are also faced with recurring issues such as underdeveloped waqf properties, unproductive nature of the assets, inability to generate self-income, loose documenting system and mismanagement. Therefore, this paper aims to shed light on the drivers of the successful practice of corporate waqf of a selected waqf institution in Malaysia. Specifically, this paper examines the critical factors that continuously drive the performance of the corporate waqf institution. The framework for the case study was premised upon the tawhidic concept which stemmed from the Quran and Sunnah. In the case study, data were drawn from interviews with key informants, participant observations and reviews of documents. Data collected from multiple sources of evidence enabled the triangulation of data. The situation has enhanced the validity and reliability of the findings. NVivo software was used to code and analyze the data as well as to search for patterns and emerging themes. The results revealed that the case company successfully engaged in waqf practice as well as, sustain its performance. The essential criteria in managing and administering waqf funds at the case company can be linked to the jihad attitude, healthy mindset, an in-depth knowledge of Islamic and waqf fundamentals and strategic leadership. The findings put forth to advance the literature on corporate waqf besides provide insights for policymakers on the drivers for an effective and efficient management of waqf funds and sustainable corporate waqf performance.

The article contains selected results of the survey research conducted by the authors at logistics enterprises in Ukraine. The obtained data were used to verify the hypotheses and to evaluate the controlling system implementation at the pharmaceutical companies in Ukraine. Methodology. To substantiate the essence of management accounting tools, the authors used the method of grouping of management accounting tools, affecting the achievement of its goals. The results of the empirical study show that almost half of the surveyed logistics companies use controlling systems in business practice. These are primarily large and medium logistics enterprises regarding employment scope and annual sales revenue. The companies applying the controlling system, as well as the business entities without it actually use operational (traditional) controlling tools, e.g. traditional cost accounting systems complemented by the selected strategic method of controlling. Conclusion. The proposed classification of management accounting tools permits to organize the terminological apparatus of the management accounting system in general and at enterprises in particular.

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TOP MANAGEMENT TEAM (TMT) NETWORKING FOR ADVANCING FIRM INNOVATIVENESS	POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						top management team (TMT); networking; firm innovativeness		This research is an attempt to examine the influence of TMT networking on firm innovativeness. Firm innovativeness has been the central concern in the upsurge competitive environment. While strategic decisions, such as, innovation has been posited to be potentially derived by the top management team (TMT), network is in fact a vital medium in providing access to different resources which has been found to be a crucial factor contributing to enhanced judgment and decisions. Despite a surge of studies emphasizing the beneficial of networking as well as examining the role of TMT in explaining the firm strategic decision, there is however little empirical research investigating the influence of TMT networking "internal and external" on firm innovativeness. Therefore, the current study has attempted to fill this gap by surveying 45 TMT leaders representing 45 companies. Findings reveal that TMT internal and external networking has significant impact of firm innovativeness. The study significantly contributes to the Upper Echelon Theory. Further, the study will also benefit the TMT leaders and practitioners as it highlighted the vital contribution of TMT internal and external networking in realizing firm innovativeness.	[Salleh, S.

J	Sanusi, A; Connell, J				Sanusi, Abdullah; Connell, Julia			Non-market strategies and Indonesian SMEs: casualties of decentralisation?	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						Procurement; SMEs; Indonesia; Non-market strategies	PUBLIC PROCUREMENT; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; EMERGING ECONOMIES; TRANSITION ECONOMY; MEDIUM ENTERPRISES; INDUSTRY CLUSTERS; FIRM; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNMENT; INNOVATION	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the non-market strategies adopted by government-contracted small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in order to address the challenges they faced in the business of procurement. Although SMEs are important contributors to employment and the national economy, they demonstrated different levels of effectiveness depending on the management strategies they adopted. Design/methodology/approach Using case study methodology, data were gathered by conducting interviews with the owners/managers of Indonesian SMEs. Findings were analysed using the (ia)(3) framework developed to assist the understanding of non-market environments. Findings Findings indicated that a key characteristic of the Indonesian non-market environment was the influence of the government and Indonesian society. This led to differing degrees of dissatisfaction among SME owners and managers who reported that they had to work within a number of constraints for business survival, while simultaneously learning how to play the games demanded by the business and regulatory environment. Research limitations/implications Limitations relate to the number of empirical cases represented and the geographical area covered. Further research is recommended in order to provide the opportunity for research generalisation. Practical implications These findings illustrate the need for transparency and integrity in the procurement process in relation to Indonesian SMEs. It is proposed that SMEs in similar sectors may benefit from forming strategic alliances/industry clusters to support future knowledge sharing and promote their collective voice. Originality/value To date, studies on non-market strategies have largely focused on developed countries and large firms. Consequently, this paper goes some way towards bridging the gap in the non-market environment in developing countries concerning SMEs and potential strategies for adoption.

J	Sawng, YW; Park, Y; Jo, SH; Park, SL				Sawng, Yeong-Wha; Park, Yongjae; Jo, Seok-Hong; Park, Seung-Lak			Technology adoption and company performance: Correlation analysis with the evidence of Korean export companies' case	JOURNAL OF KOREA TRADE			English	Article						Convergence; Company performance; Technology adoption; Korean export companies; Measurement model; Radio frequency identification (RFID)	BALANCED SCORECARD; SUPPLY CHAIN; INNOVATION CAPABILITIES; IMPACT; MODEL; DETERMINANTS; MANAGEMENT; CUSTOMER; SYSTEM; CONVERGENCE	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide useful implications for Korean export companies to adopt the smart technology to improve their performance in the era of industrial convergence with the interdisciplinary study between trade and technology management. Design/methodology/approach This study followed the five-stage procedure and methods. In the first stage, measurement items were developed in four performance factors: leaning and growth, internal process, customer and finance. In the second stage, data were collected by conducting two types of surveys: first, for Korean export companies that have adopted Radio frequency identification (RFID) to test the proposed model and analyze the performance and second, for RFID experts of industry-university R&D cooperation to measure the relative importance of factors and items. In the third stage, the model was verified with structural equation modeling. In the fourth stage, AHP was used to analyze the relative importance of factors and items. In the fifth stage, post-RFID adoption performance in Korean export companies was measured by a formula for the performance index. Through these five-stage procedure and methods, the final performance improvement strategies and practical implications are presented in the conclusion. Findings The framework finds that the total score of RFID post-adoption on company performance proved relatively low, which indicates that the effect of this technology on export companies' performance is still unsatisfactory. And financial performance proved to be top priority' area, which requires the most urgent effort for improvement since its importance was higher than learning and growth, internal process and customer performancebut nonetheless its performance index was the lowest. This study finds that strategic decision making is required for adopting smart technology in the perspective of technology convergence to improve the performance of companies among heterogeneous industries. Research limitations/implications Despite the significant results of this study alone, it also has limitations. Therefore, the direction of the future study is as follows: future research should focus on finding specific impact factors enhancing post-adoption of smart technologies including RFID performance by conducting empirical studies that identify the factors affecting post adoption of smart technologies rate directly or indirectly. Originality/value In the current global market environment, not only technological convergence in the same kind of industry but also industrial convergence in the different kinds of industries are essential to manufacturing and service companies including to export companies with perspective of Innovation. This study has the value as an interdisciplinary study to actually measure the performance of a company by industrial convergence through the theme of adoption of smart technology in export companies.

PREMISES FOR ESTABLISHING A REGIONAL MOBILITY CENTRE FOR THE DANUBE DELTA AREA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						mobility management; information centre; mobility behaviour; mitigating climate change	SUSTAINABLE TOURISM	In support of the transition to sustainable mobility, a large array of strategic documents concerning sustainable development at European, national and local level set associated objectives to be met through specific instruments such as mobility remodelling projects. 2018 has been labeled by the European Commission as the 'Year of Multimodality', raising awareness on the importance of multimodality - use of different modes of transport on the same journey - for the efficiency of transport solutions. Tools for integrated mobility management will help reduce CO2 emissions and improve the quality of life of European citizens, contributing towards the Paris Agreement targets. Sustainable mobility solutions are deemed as increasingly relevant for tourism destinations, especially in natural protected areas like the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, where environmental pressures from touristic activities need to be mitigated in order to preserve biodiversity and landscape quality. Practices that aim at reducing the socio-ecological impact of visitor movement within the territory include providing visitors with the necessary support for responsible tourism, including comprehensive and up-to-date information on ecotourism alternatives and sustainable mobility options for their trips. The premises for creating a mobility information centre for Danube Delta, as a measure for increasing the quality of services provided in the nodes of an international destinations network along the Danube, have been studied in the context of the activities carried out in the Inter-reg Danube project Transdanube.Pearls. Based on a collection of best practices from comparative case studies across the European Union and an analysis of the state-of-the-art of regional mobility and tourism systems in the Danube Delta area, we conclude that establishing a regional mobility centre in Tulcea municipality, in a close partnership with relevant stakeholders, would positively impact the mobility behaviour of both tourists and inhabitants and increase mobility management capacities of local and regional authorities.

J	Shvets, V; Baranets, H; Tryfonova, O				Shvets, Vasyl; Baranets, Hanna; Tryfonova, Olena			EVALUATION OF THE CONDITIONS OF EFFECTIVE LOGISTIC STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENTERPRISE ON THE BASIS OF FUNCTIONAL AND COST ANALYSIS	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						logistic potential; logistic strategy; functional and cost analysis; situational profile; logistic costs		In the context of the current dynamic environment, the complexity of socio-economic objects stipulates the increased requirements for their analysis. The field of strategic logistic management is not an exception. The logistic potential is considered as a control object. Formation elements of the potential determine the conditions for the successful implementation of the selected logistic strategy of an enterprise. The potential of managerial logistic personnel, technological personnel, logistic infrastructure, product and technological innovations in logistics, marketing research, organizational and transfer potential are considered as logistic potential elements. Problems concerning substantiation of logistic strategy selection, determination of the internal conditions to provide its efficient implementation, as well as quantitative measurement of the conditions, are still unstudied. The purpose of the paper is to carry out functional and cost analysis (FCA) of logistic potential elements of an enterprise to estimate the correspondence of the internal conditions to the selected logistic strategy. Methodology. FCA as a method of research is used. The sequence of the FCA implementation and characteristic of its main stages are considered in the paper. Special attention is paid to expert assessments of the significance of logistic potential elements which are regarded as internal conditions for the strategic changes realization in the area of enterprise logistics. To do that, the paper applies techniques of priority ranking and pairwise comparisons. The consistency of the obtained results is proved statistically. Statistic factor of the relative range has been applied to characterize the dispersion of individual significances obtained for each logistic potential element. Results. The paper has developed a sequence of the FCA implementation with the characterization of its basic stages. There has been described preparatory, information, analytical, research, and recommendation stages. The proposed sequence matches a traditional concept of the FCA stages. However, their contents vary depending upon object specifics, identification of objectives and tasks of carrying out analysis. Value/originality. The results of the study in the form of the expert evaluation of the significance of the logistic potential elements give an opportunity to plan the costs connected with the introduction of strategic changes in the field of an enterprise logistics.

J	Singh, H; Singh, R; Kota, HB				Singh, Harjit; Singh, Ramanjeet; Kota, Hima Bindu			THE MEDIATING ROLE OF INFLUENCE, VISION AND ENTREPRENEURIAL CONTEXT	SERBIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						entrepreneurial success; entrepreneurship; innovation; leadership; management style	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS; LEADERSHIP	This research work seeks to investigate the issues that inspire an entrepreneur to be successful in his entrepreneurial journey. Mediating role of influence and vision are viewed as inevitable resources for strategic entrepreneurship. The paper sheds lights on the leadership style and analyses the issues related to influence, motivate, restructuring, and contribute to the field's growing body of work. The research study employs a case study method. The interviewees were interviewed by theme questions and secondary information was gathered to strengthen the empirical section. The findings demonstrate that a successful organisation comes in existence not only because of the efforts put in by self-motivated individual who is ready to undertake responsibility of leading and taking risks. This necessitates distinctive quality on the part of an entrepreneur who is always cognizant of the new developments and vagaries surrounding him and does not hesitate to adapt to those changes. The case presents an opportunity for burgeoning entrepreneurs and would-be managers to comprehend how leadership style and entrepreneurial context guarantee entrepreneurial success.

J	Siti-Nabiha, AK; Azhar, Z; Ali-Mokhtar, MA				Siti-Nabiha, A. K.; Azhar, Zubir; Ali-Mokhtar, Mohd-Aatif			MANAGEMENT CONTROL FOR MICROFINANCE: AN EXAMINATION OF THE BELIEF SYSTEM OF A MALAYSIAN MICROFINANCE PROVIDER	ASIAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE			English	Article						management control; belief system; informal control; microfinance; developmental financial institution	INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS; COMPETING LOGICS; ORGANIZATIONS; LEVERS; STRATEGIES; COMMUNITY; MISSION	This paper examines how the belief system of a bank that provides microfinance services influences formal and informal control mechanisms and consequently shapes decisions and the strategic direction of microfinancing in Malaysia. Using institutional logics perspective as our theoretical lens, we conducted a case study in a Malaysian developmental financial institution (DFI) responsible for providing microfinancing. The results suggest that it is difficult to achieve a balance between economic and social considerations when the banking belief system is strongly rooted in the overall banking practices. This paper highlights the dominance of the banking logic over the social logic as reflected in the DFI's management control system. Specifically, it demonstrates how its belief system underpins its microfinance activities due to a focus on risk-return considerations, which aim to minimise non-performing loans and maximise commercial profits. This consequently affects clients who have obtained microfinance products and services. This paper also demonstrates how the hiring carriers of social logic do not appear to infuse the organisation with social logic, due to the vague and compartmentalised structure of the microfinance segment and a lack of long-term social goals in both external and internal monitoring systems.

J	Sitnicki, M				Sitnicki, Maksym			FRANCHISING MODEL OF COMMERCIALIZATION OF SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES' SERVICES AT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						digital franchising; franchising model; scientific libraries; research universities; commercialization of services	GROWTH	The aim of the article is the formation of an innovative model for the commercialization of the services of scientific libraries of research universities in order to increase their financial autonomy. The methodology of the research is based on the use of methods: scientific generalization, systematization, comparison, modelling. The object of research is the activity of scientific libraries of research universities, which strive to vary in the current conditions of rapid technological development. The research results consist of the systematization of the main and secondary functions of scientific libraries of research universities. A new economic category of "digital franchising" has been proposed and characterized as a model of cooperation between the franchisor and the franchisee when the rights to use and represent the company of the franchisor in the intercontinental digital space are transferred. The franchisee has the right to use the company name, services, goods, technological processes, and software of the franchisor to create its own digital network of sub-franchisees and digital products on the basis of the conditions specified in the contract. Such kind of franchising will allow settling relations in a digital cyberspace, promptly developing and getting new, yet not completely studied forms. Comparison of traditional and digital models of franchising has allowed to show differences on ten basic criteria: costs for building a network; speed of interaction; level of managerial flexibility; updating of the system; the possibility of expanding the network; financial control; brand management; rate of return; the speed of information about new services; need for operational management. The revealed discrepancies are mainly characterized by different timeframes for implementing managerial decisions and excellent approaches to the formation and use of the necessary financial and organizational resources. The author has developed an innovative franchise model, which makes it possible to effectively commercialize the services of scientific libraries. This model is based on the use of franchising by building a broad network of digital services. The peculiarity of digital franchising is revealed, which consists in the essential optimization of expenses for organizing the activities of scientific libraries, in comparison with the traditional model, and speeding up the pace and quality of service. The practical significance of the obtained results lies in new opportunities for pushing a new wave of development of methods for commercializing the services of scientific libraries of research universities and their dissemination at the global level. Using the developed innovative franchise model will be useful for theorists and practitioners engaged in the development of strategies for the development of research universities and their scientific libraries. The main conclusion of the research is that the introduction of a developed marketing tool by talented managers with an entrepreneurial type of thinking will become a source of financial autonomy for scientific libraries of research universities they manage. Digital expansion in a strategic perspective will absorb all the major information flows that affect the development of the world. Libraries of research universities, as key centres for aggregation and translation of scientific information and knowledge, should be ready for such scenario and already experiment with new tools for the future, which is digital franchising.

J	Smerichevskyi, S; Kniazieva, T; Walid, A				Smerichevskyi, Serhii; Kniazieva, Tetiana; Walid, Atia			ASSESSMENT OF MARKETING ACTIVITY MANAGEMENT IN TERRITORIAL UNITS: THEORETICAL-METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						territorial marketing; area marketing potential; regional policy; sustainable economic development; strategic planning of territorial marketing	STRATEGY	The subject of the study is a set of theoretical and methodological aspects of the development of organizational and economic relations that arise in the process of interaction of economic subjects while shaping the potential of territorial marketing as a factor of its socio-economic development. The purpose of the study is to substantiate the methodology for assessing the integral indicator of the territorial marketing functioning. The methodology of the presented study of marketing management in territorial units is based on the multivariate assessment of various economic entities that clearly shows the priorities and unevenness in the areas'development. Area economic entities themselves are interested in the area development and determine the direction of area development. Economic entities' direct residence and economic activity conducted by them in the area should be taken into account. This makes them serious experienced experts who are really interested in the effective and rapid development of their area. Economic entities themselves determine the measurable criteria for assessing the directions that they were originally offered. The "brainstorming" is used where the experts in the area development are involved. There is a joint process aimed at obtaining the most concrete and measurable results that actual state is assessed from 0 to 10 by the process participants based on personal observations and statistics. The evaluation of marketing results is based on the multicriteria socio-economic approach. The evaluation criteria should include the economic mechanism formation. This mechanism provides an effective interaction of market institutions and business entities in the area; selection of wholesale and retail organizational and economic forms, financial and credit and business services, as well as organizational and legal forms of trade and economic interregional ties; the markets system creation that is based on the priority provision of consumers and small owners interest; the choice of the most effective channels for goods movement, transportation, warehousing, material, financial, and information flows rationalization. The methodology for estimating the integral indicator of territorial marketing functioning that is presented in the work is based on the next indicators: financial stability, business activity, profitability, technical and technological stability, social sustainability, environmental sustainability that allows monitoring the functioning of the territorial marketing system. This methodology is universal since it allows evaluating areas of different industrial orientations and comparing them in order to identify the greatest functioning stability. Methodology for marketing research of areas potential is based on the system approach, complex consideration of conceptual principles of areas' marketing potential formation and development; key features of territorial marketing allow carrying out purposeful actions for the sustainable development of area marketing potential, within the framework of which the conditions of its formation are determined, and their aggregate acts as a point of growth of market marketing component of the economic potential of the territory and is the basis for constructing the model of infrastructure of the marketing potential of the territory, used to make sound and balanced management decisions; developed a methodology for assessing the integral indicator of the functioning of territorial marketing. Research conclusion: grounded methodology of research of territorial marketing potential that is based on the system approach, complex consideration of concepts of area marketing potential formation and development. The key features of territorial marketing are distinguished that allow carrying out purposeful actions for the stable development of the area marketing potential, within the framework of which the conditions for its forming are determined, and their complex serves as a point of growth of market marketing component of the area economic potential and is the basis for the creation of the infrastructure model for the area marketing potential that is used to make substantiated and balanced management decisions; a methodology for assessing the integral indicator of territorial marketing is developed.

However, in addition to issues of internet-related insecurity issues, the neglect or malpractice of system analysts and programmers can be decisive for delivering software products that do not properly exploit the use of information security mechanisms, making attacks on information succeed. This article aims to propose an information security management framework in order to support professionals and companies that develop Web applications for them to adopt, institutionalize and train in good practices on the use of encryption, digital signature, digital certificate and access control. The adoption of this proposed framework is expected to contribute for Web applications to get higher levels of information protection.

Therefore, comprehensive planning to prevent and reduce plagiarism, or actions to internalize honesty in speech, behavior, and actions, will not only make researches worthwhile but also reduce plagiarism. Methods: In this qualitative research, eighteen faculty members of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences participated from 2015-2016. Data were collected through a semi-structured interview and analyzed by qualitative content analysis (Mayring method). Results: Effective factors in the prevention of plagiarism were extracted and presented in 23 subclasses and four themes including policy-making, legislation, an institutionalization of ethics in research, and the application of technology capabilities. Conclusion: Providing strategic and operational plans to internalize ethics in research and gradual changes in policy making and updating laws and regulations are factors affecting preventive measures. Also, with an increase in information literacy and applying information technology capabilities, it is possible to prevent informed and uninformed plagiarism.

World tendencies of the interaction of business elements are characterized by decentralized integration, in which, preserving their legal and industrial identity, small and medium business is united in economic communities, trying to withstand large monopolistic associations. The modern business environment in the dual model at one pole is represented by corporations, TNCs, MNCs, and at the other pole - by free entrepreneurs (freelancers), the number of which is steadily growing. The contradictions and shortcomings of both poles are harmonized by the intra-national integration of economic interests. New business models of economic interaction arise that require new models and forms of management, require the creation of new, adaptive formats of business interaction that involves the mandatory inclusion of standards for sustainable development (economic, environmental, and social mechanism). Such a new form of management, in our view, can be an innovative model of conglomerate management, which implies not only conglomerate mergers and acquisitions of corporations but also new mechanisms for interaction of small business structures of different economic and sectoral orientation. The terminology and the theoretical basis for studying the conglomerate as a socio-economic system that includes the basic phrase "socio-economic system" were defined. Such a form of organization of socio-economic systems, which would consolidate high competitive advantages, innovative orientation, and significant expansive potential, is proposed. On the basis of generalization of the corresponding theoretical provisions and revealed peculiarities of the formation of spatially localized systems, we assumed that emerging as local "points" of economic growth zones, individual elements or subsystems of enterprises are transformed into territorial production complexes (hereinafter abbreviated as TPC), and then - by implementing the missing infrastructure and institutional components into a variety of cluster forms, into conglomerates. As a result of the research, the following scientific substantiations and conclusions are formulated: 1. For the first time, the term "conglomerate management" was proposed as the aggregate interaction of enterprises united into a spatially localized socio-economic system and a methodological approach to managing such complex structures. 2. A terminology for investigating the purposeful transformation of society and the economy into an additive socioeconomic system is developed. Such studies are especially relevant for the modern domestic economy, which contains controversial characteristics of the deterministic and nondeterministic economic model, as well as poorly predicted agglomerate and synergistic effects. 3. A model for organizing and managing conglomerates of a new type is formed.The architecture of the conglomerate enterprise management model as an element of a socio-economic system with an innovative basis as a priority for the dynamic development of a conglomerate is proposed. 4. We also find it economically sound to create a model of developing the strategic potential of an enterprise as an open socio-economic system, to use the mathematical apparatus of studying models of the fractal type that describes the evolution of a modelled system of fractal objects. 5. A parametric characteristic of the formation of a deterministic model of conglomerate control of a fractal type as a socio-economic system was developed and brought to the form of an economic-mathematical model.

J	Staron, M; Niesel, K; Bauman, N				Staron, Miroslaw; Niesel, Kent; Bauman, Niclas			Milestone-Oriented Usage of Key Performance Indicators - An Industrial Case Study	E-INFORMATICA SOFTWARE ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						software metrics; key performance indicator; project management; case study	AGILE	Background: Key Performance Indicators are a common way of quantitative monitoring of project progress in modern companies. Although they are widely used in practice, there is little evidence on how they are set, and how many of them are used in large product development projects. Goal: The goal of this paper is to explore how KPIs are used in practice in a large company. In particular, it is explored whether KPIs are used continuously or only during short, predefined periods of time. It is also explored whether software-related KPIs are reported differently from non-software-related KPIs. Method: A case study of 12 projects at the Volvo Car Group in Sweden was conducted. The data from the project progress reporting on tools was collected and triangulated with data from interviews conducted with experts from the company. Results: KPIs are reported mostly before the milestones and the manual assessment of their status is equally important as the automated data provision in the KPI reporting system. The trend of reporting software-related KPIs is very similar to the non-software-related KPIs. Conclusions: Despite the documented good practices of using KPIs for project monitoring, it is difficult to develop a clear status-picture solely using quantitative data from progress reporting tools. It was also shown that the trends in reporting the software-related KPIs are similar to the trends in reporting the non-software related KPIs.

J	Strafford, D; Crowther, P; Schofield, P				Strafford, David; Crowther, Phil; Schofield, Peter			Enlivenment and the Gruffalo: the unfolding story of events in destination shopping centres	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EVENT AND FESTIVAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Event portfolio; Commercial events; Destination shopping; Marketing events; Shopping centre experience; Strategic events	OUTCOMES; MALL	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the growing, and multifaceted, role for events within destination shopping centres. With particular focus upon The Gruffalo experience (GE)-a three week pop-up experiential children's activation-the study offers insights and provides a conceptual framework, relating to the emerging and future role of events. Design/methodology/approach - The study emerged from a privileged opportunity to research The GE, enabling a visitor questionnaire survey (n 1/4 1,305), using a non-probability sample, and four in-depth interviews, which were extended by an additional seven respondents. Findings - There is a noteworthy role for events as "enlivenment"; attractors to increase visitation, repeat visitation and equally to impact dwell time and boost footfall and sales for tenants. The study revealed a need for a developed event portfolio, with various fundamental tensions relating to objectives, tenants, integration with wider strategy and customer experience. Research limitations/implications - By interlinking events with shopping, re-visitation intention is improved and therefore not only does it deliver short-term return but longer-term payback. The vast assortment of events, and stakeholders, means a strategic and reflective approach is required. A limitation of the study is that there is limited existing research on this topic upon which to compare the overall findings, or specifically the survey data and analysis. Originality/value - This early research study into events within destination shopping centres has revealed a prolific and advantageous, but also emerging and intricate, relationship. There is an absence of extant literature and therefore this paper makes a notable contribution to this unfolding area.

Analysis of mill data in the Herbert has successfully identified groups of farming enterprises with similar productivity over time and the major factors associated with these groupings. Timing of all operations, including planting, weed and nutrient management and harvesting, engagement with industry organisations and fertile soils with high CEC, were important factors that discriminated the small-farm-size-low producing farming enterprises from the small-farm-size high producing farming enterprises. This study has allowed Herbert Cane Productivity Services and SRA to design strategic adoption strategies for targeted audiences. Packages based on individual productivity drivers are being developed for growers whose business enterprise is greater than 175 ha. Small farming enterprises with productivity in the 75-85 t/ha will be involved in group extension activities. Growers in the target groups have been using QCANESeIect (TM) to assist in planning, managing and implementing a new variety program to minimise the risk of disease and improve productivity.

J	Sumets, A				Sumets, Alexander			MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR BUSINESS	AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS-INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC E-JOURNAL			Ukrainian	Article						strategy; business; management; development; strategic set		The paper aims to systematize business management strategies and identify their potential opportunities for the development of the competitive business advantages in transition economies. Characteristics of the features of modern business in developing countries (on the example of Ukraine) are given in the article in concise form. The relevance of the study of the relationship between strategy and business management is substantiated. Modern interpretations of the concepts of "strategy", "strategic management", "strategic set of strategies", "business" and "competitive business potentials" are presented. A generalized classification of strategies used in practice for effective business management and its development is described. Possibilities of strategies for formation of competitive business advantages in the modern conditions of market transformations are determined. The scheme of the pyramid hierarchy of a "strategic set of strategies" of a diversified organization is presented. An analog model of competitive business potential by implementing a strategic set of strategies is formalized. Directions of further research are recommended. They include: analysis of the impact of strategies on the process of business management, evaluating the effectiveness of using strategies for effective business management and the choice of priority strategies for effective business management.

J	Susanto				Susanto			Position of Investigative Audit Results on State Owned Enterprises' Property in the Criminal Proof of Law in Indonesia	JURNAL CITA HUKUM-INDONESIAN LAW JOURNAL			Indonesian	Article						Investigative Audit; State-Owned Enterprise; Evidence		Entering the era of globalization, several state-owned enterprises have improved management, particularly the efficiency of operations in order to be able to face market competition. The improvement measures taken include business restructuring, reduction in the number of employees, implementation of management control systems, and other strategic policies. State-owned enterprises that do not improve management will usually face various difficulties, especially in the financial sector. In the legal process of calculating state losses caused by mistakes of State-Owned Enterprises, an investigative audit is required, because investigative audits can be used to determine whether or not there is a Law Against Acts, mains read and abuse of authority that results in state losses as the majority shareholder in the Owned Enterprise Country. The position of the investigative audit results on State-Owned Enterprises in the Indonesian legal system of proof is; As a statement of the witness, as a proof of letter, as evidence of expert testimony, as evidence of guidance, as evidence of indicated / suspected evidence.

J	Szierbowski-Seibel, K; Kabst, R				Szierbowski-Seibel, Klaas; Kabst, Ruediger			The impact of HR outsourcing and strategic HR integration on the HR-to-employee ratio: An empirical evaluation of the HR function over the last decade	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER			English	Article						Outsourcing; Human resource management; HR-to-employee ratio; Strategic HR integration	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; SERVICES; RECRUITMENT; DEVOLVEMENT; INSIGHTS; FIRM; VIEW; LINK	Purpose Two simultaneous trends have arisen in the field of HRM: the development of the human resource (HR) function toward a more strategic, value adding unit and the trend of HR outsourcing (HRO). Opinions are divided in the field of HRM research regarding the interdependences between these two trends and whether the HR function has a positive or negative effect. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the triangular relationship among strategic HR integration, the HR-to-employee ratio and HRO. Design/methodology/approach This study analyses data from three large evaluations conducted in 14 European countries and compares the results obtained from the 2000, 2005 and 2010 Cranet survey waves. For the hypotheses, a multilevel regression design was used. Findings The results allow concluding that HRO supports the professionalization of the HR function in an effort to make it a strategic asset. Research limitations/implications This study extends prior understandings of the theoretical perspective on HRO and its organizational impact. The sample is nested within 14 European countries and influenced by cultural aspects and institutional factors. These influences could be an exciting avenue for further research. Practical implications This paper includes important implications for HR practitioners. The results support a rather optimistic view of the HR function regarding its relationship with HRO and the latter's impact on the HR-to-employee ratio and strategic HR integration. Originality/value The study answers the question: has HRO downsized internal HR staff over the past decade, and how is it related to the strategic integration of the HR function? In this context, this study analyses Cranet data to contribute to the discussion on the development of strategic HR integration and the impact of HRO on such efforts. Moreover, the study examines the influence of HRO on internal HR staff based on the theoretical framework of the resource-based view.

J	Tampieri, L; Canonico, P				Tampieri, Laura; Canonico, Paolo			NETWORK ANALYSIS FOR PERFORMANCE CONTROL IN THE GOVERNANCE OF INTERCONNECTED LOCAL TRANSPORT COMPANIES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						built environment; transport; network; ties; governance	BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS; CAPABILITIES; SYSTEMS	This paper discusses a network-analysis approach to the performance control of integrated built-environment systems based on efficiency, effectiveness, and adequacy. We apply this perspective to the governance of systems of local transport companies in built environments, which are frequently organized as networks. To this end, we propose a multidimensional grid of first- and second-order ties to locate network units and individuate the adequacy or appropriateness of network structures for performance control. In this field, issues connected to transport systems such as sustainability play a crucial role in defining structures and processes of network performance control. We empirically examine a pilot case of local public transport companies in the Forli-Cesena area (Italy), testing network adequacy and giving evidence for the optimal localization of governance among units dedicated to providing transport services. Our results also support the hypothesis that, although structural centralization was ostensibly oriented towards increasing governance, the structure actually devolved into decentralized control at the periphery of the network, diminishing the effectiveness of initiatives.

Research, theoretical and practical tasks of sustainable real estate development process were revised, particular examples presented. Different models and methods for analysis of real estate development discussed. Decision support model, encompassing extensive analysis of the global trends, best crisis management practices, assessment of the factual situation and provision of recommendations for different stakeholders under conditions of market instability presented. According to proposed model, the research was performed by studying the expertise of advanced industrial economies and by adapting such to Lithuania while taking into consideration its specific history, development level, needs and traditions. Basing on these findings, accumulated know-how, the results of previous scientific studies and practical insights of the other authors, specific recommendations to avoid crisis and minimize its consequences in macro-, meso- and micro-levels were provided. Recommendations illustrate holistic point of view and assumption that real estate development consists of creativity, research and art.

Design/methodology/approach The Academic Primary Healthcare Network (APHN) initiative was launched in 2011 in Stockholm County, Sweden and included 201 primary healthcare centres. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2013-2014 with all coordinating managers (n=8) and coordinators (n=4). A strategic change model framework was used to collect and analyse data. Findings Several factors were identified to aid early implementation: assignment and guidelines that allowed flexibility; supportive management; dedicated staff; facilities that enabled APHN actions to be integrated into healthcare practice; and positive experiences from research and educational activities. Implementation was hindered by: discrepancies between objectives and resources; underspecified guidelines that trigger passivity; limited research and educational activities; a conflicting non-supportive reimbursement system; limited planning; and organisational fragmentation. Intermediate outcomes revealed that various actions, informed by the APHN assignment, were launched in all APHNs. Practical implications The findings can be rendered applicable by preparing stakeholders in healthcare services to optimise early implementation of healthcare-academia partnerships. Originality/value This study increases understanding of interactions between factors that influence early stage partnerships between healthcare services and academia in primary healthcare settings.

Rolling the Dice: What Methodological Choices Maximize Chances for Publication in Premier Strategic Management Journals?	METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES AND ADVANCES IN MANAGERIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL COGNITION	New Horizons in Managerial and Organizational Cognition		English	Article; Book Chapter						Managerial cognition; content analysis; methodological practices; premier journals; strategy; publications	FIRM PERFORMANCE; FOUNDING INSTITUTIONS; AMJ; ACQUISITIONS; ORGANIZATION; REFLECTION; INERTIA; IMPACT; TESTS	Managerial cognition is a fundamental area informing all sub-fields in strategy, and therefore, a systematic review of the methodological choices of premier strategy publications aids cognition researchers in choosing methods. However, past studies have given little attention to the methods recently published in premier journals. This chapter both illustrates a common cognitive method - content analysis and uses it to analyze the methodological content of 573 publications from two prominent management journals. Our findings provide cognition scholars with useful information about current methodological standards. Our findings also will help students choose methods courses and will spark a healthy debate about methodological expectations.

J	Waye, VC				Waye, Vicki Catherine			The initiation and operations phase of the litigation funder - class action law firm relationship: An Australian perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Class actions; Law firms; Litigation funding	ALLIANCE PARTNER SELECTION; TRUST; RISK; FIT	Purpose Drawing on Strategic Alliance literature and qualitative research methods, the purpose of this study is to examine the initiation and operations phases of the relationship between Australian litigation funders and class law firms. The initiation phase examines factors such as complementarity between needs and assets compatibility between the funder and the class law firm goals of the alliance trust and alliance structure. The operations phase considers factors such as governance, communication and risk management and accountability. Because of its focus on the fairness of settlement, case law provides limited understanding of the drivers of the class law firm and funder relationship. An inside look of how the funder-law firm is initiated and made operational provides a more accurate picture and has important implications for the management of the ethical issues that arise during the course of that relationship. Design/methodology/approach This paper is a content analysis and contains qualitative interviews. Findings The strategic alliance between class law firms and litigation funders has evolved within an institutional climate that has acknowledged the benefits that the alliance can bring to the conduct of class actions. That same institutional environment has led to an alliance which is informal and transactionally oriented, where each of the parties maintains a demarcation in function. Although they share aspects of the strategic management of class actions, funders continue to be diligent monitors of class law firms, and class law firms continue to advance the legal rights of class members. Research limitations/implications It is observed that the size of the sample is small driven by a number of market participants. Practical implications The paper confirms that the litigation funder-law firm strategic alliance works well as a result of institutional constraints. Social implications Each of the alliance partners was keen to ensure that neither they nor their partner acted in a way which might attract judicial disapproval. Each also believed that they played a positive role in promoting class member interests, albeit that their primary motivation was to earn fees or a commission. The success of the alliance between class law firms and litigation funders has substantially improved access to justice in Australia for small claims holders. Originality/value The paper provides insight into a strategic alliance which is formed primarily for the benefit of third parties. This is one of the first papers to consider the litigation funder-law firm relationship through the lens of strategic alliance literature.

J	Wei, WH; Wan, ATK; Zhou, Y				Wei, Wenhua; Wan, Alan T. K.; Zhou, Yong			Partially linear transformation model for length-biased and right-censored data	JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS			English	Article						Estimating equations; length-biased sampling; local linear fitting technique; partially linear transformation model; right-censoring	PSEUDO-PARTIAL LIKELIHOOD; PREVALENT COHORT; NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION; EMPIRICAL DISTRIBUTIONS; VARYING COEFFICIENTS; HAZARDS REGRESSION; SURVIVAL	In this paper, we consider a partially linear transformation model for data subject to length-biasedness and right-censoring which frequently arise simultaneously in biometrics and other fields. The partially linear transformation model can account for nonlinear covariate effects in addition to linear effects on survival time, and thus reconciles a major disadvantage of the popular semiparamnetric linear transformation model. We adopt local linear fitting technique and develop an unbiased global and local estimating equations approach for the estimation of unknown covariate effects. We provide an asymptotic justification for the proposed procedure, and develop an iterative computational algorithm for its practical implementation, and a bootstrap resampling procedure for estimating the standard errors of the estimator. A simulation study shows that the proposed method performs well in finite samples, and the proposed estimator is applied to analyse the Oscar data.

J	Yaremko, Y; Shykova, L; Syvolap, L				Yaremko, Yurii; Shykova, Liliia; Syvolap, Larysa			METHODS OF EVALUATION AND CONCEPTUAL-STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS OF ECONOMIC SECURITY OF AGRICULTURAL ENTERPRISES	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						economic security; agricultural enterprise; methodology of evaluation; concept; strategy		The purpose of the paper is to identify an effective method for assessing economic security and to formulate conceptual and strategic directions for raising the level of economic security of agricultural enterprises operating in conditions of instability and uncertainty. Methodology. In the process of research, general scientific and specific research methods were used. In particular, the method of statistical analysis was used in determining the dynamics of the number of agricultural enterprises. The methods of synthesis and analysis were used to identify the negative trends that affect the activities of agricultural enterprises. Using from abstract to specific methods, an algorithm for assessing the level of economic security of agricultural enterprises and the formation stages of the enterprise economic security concept were determined. Results. The article defines the main modern functioning tendencies of agricultural enterprises. It is suggested to use such means as financial, human resources, legal, informational, organizational to ensure the proper level of economic security of agricultural enterprises. The article states that the methodology for assessing the level of economic security consists of two approaches: qualitative and quantitative determination of the level of economic security. The authors systematize the indicators for assessing the level of economic security of the agricultural enterprise. The basic features of the economic security concept of agricultural enterprises are determined. The general strategies of the enterprise are described, which can be used both for agricultural enterprises and for other companies of different branches of the economy, in accordance with the level of economic security. Practical meaning. The article provides materials that give an understanding of the algorithm for assessing the level of economic security of an agricultural enterprise. The authors present the systematization of components and indicators for assessing the level of economic security, which in practice allows the most effective and reliable determination of the level of economic security. The detailed description of the company's general strategies allows us to identify and implement precisely the strategy that will maximize the level of economic security of the enterprise. Strategic directions improved by authors for the formation of economic security of agricultural enterprises provide the opportunity to identify the necessary tools, with the help of which it is possible to achieve the maximum level of economic security of the enterprise. Value/originality. The paper analyses the methodology of evaluation and conceptual-strategic directions of economic security of agricultural enterprises, which proves the urgency and necessity of the considered issues. The presented results of the research and the propositions on the strategic improvement of the economic security level of agricultural enterprises can improve the efficiency of the enterprises of the agrarian sector. Taking into account the significant contribution of agriculture to the country's economy, the research allows improving not only the performance of individual enterprises but also the effectiveness of the national economy as a whole.

KEY DRIVERS OF BRAND LOYALTY AMONG MALAYSIAN SHOPPERS: EVIDENCE FROM A JAPANESE FASHION RETAILER	ASIAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						brand evidence; brand hearsay; brand loyalty; Japan; retail clothing	SELF-IMAGE CONGRUENCE; SERVICE BRAND; PERCEPTIONS; SATISFACTION; CUSTOMERS; IMPACT; PERFORMANCE; INTENTIONS; ASSORTMENT; MODEL	Due to the uncertain, changing landscape and challenges in the fast-moving fashion retailing market, fashion retailers have to find their way to stay competitive and survive in the market. One of the ways is through effective use of branding. Focusing on a currently-leading, Japanese fast fashion retailer (Uniqlo), this research sought to determine the branding attributes which could lead to the formation of brand loyalty among customers. The Service Brand Verdict Model (SBVM) served as the basis for this study's research model. Through the partial least squares (SmartPLS 3.2.6) analysis on 309 Uniqlo customers, the results showed that merchandise, value-for-money, feelings, self-image congruence and uncontrolled communications are significant aspects that contribute to building brand loyalty among customers. In building intense and active loyalty among customers, both tangible and rational aspects of a brand as well as the imagery and emotional aspects of it need to be integrated in strategic branding decisions.

Global threats were evaluated and defined as dangerous processes, phenomena, and situations that cause harm to health, safety, well-being, and the lives of all humanity, and require to be eliminated. The essence of global risks was defined. These risks were identified as events or conditions that may cause a significant negative effect for several countries or spheres within a strategic period if they occur. Global problems were conceptualized. These problems were defined as phenomena, matters, and situations that are not completely understandable, interesting, actual, require solving and regulation, and in addition do not have unified solutions. Current global challenges were analysed, defined as strategic guidelines that cause transformational changes and are receiving attention from humanity. Global trends were defined as courses of social development.

J	Zachosova, N; Babina, N				Zachosova, Nataliia; Babina, Nataliia			DIAGNOSTICS BY FINANCIAL REGULATORS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PREPAREDNESS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY MANAGEMENT	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						management; economic security; financial institutions; regulation; financial market; economic security management		In the conditions of the financial system destabilization in Ukraine, caused by such negative phenomena as military actions in the East, the economic downturn, political and financial crises, population disappointment in the institution of power and loss of the people's confidence in power structures and so on, market mechanisms are not able to ensure the restoration of the national financial market and to encourage its professional participants to use mechanisms of protection their own assets and the assets of their clients from external and internal threats actively. State interference in the functioning of financial institutions is necessary, especially for those of their types, whose bankruptcy may have fatal consequences for the welfare of the population and cause the liquidation of economic entities of the domestic economy. Among them are: banks, insurance companies, credit unions, and other institutions of credit co-operation, investment companies, in particular, joint investment institutions (unit and corporate investment funds), non-state pension funds, leasing, factoring, and other financial companies, pawns, etc. Therefore, it is expedient to consider the possibility of the influence of state regulators in financial services markets on the state of their participants' economic security. However, the study of the realities of the financial market of Ukraine development has made it possible to assert that for a number of financial institutions, the concept of economic security is something abstract, and the understanding by their top management the importance of economic security management, taking into account the negative market trends, is completely absent. So, the purpose of this study is to diagnose the level of financial institutions preparedness for the implementation of economic security management into their common system of management. The high level of financial market participants' readiness for safe-oriented management will allow regulators to rapidly implement in their practice a list of recommendations that will minimize the threat of bankruptcy and liquidation of domestic financial institutions. Methodology. In the process of preparing a scientific article, a great number of literary sources was considered. Some of them were developed using the method of theoretical generalization and the monographic method. The theoretical results presented in the research materials were obtained on the basis of the study of works of such scientists as Amadae S. M., Baily M. N., Elliott D. J., Ismail Z., Johnson K. N., Mirtchev A., Nelson J. A., Raczkowski K., Schneider F., Sidek Z. M., Ula M., Whalen C. J., Wierzbicka E., Yong J. To confirm the reliability of the scientific results presented in the article, the authors used the Delphi method and expert evaluation. The list of indicators for assessing the level of financial institutions readiness for the implementation of a mechanism for managing economic security in the following five areas is formed. These areas are: the availability and condition of the economic security system, the state of information and analytical support for the adoption of management decisions in the field of economic security, the state of intellectual and personnel management provision of economic security, reserves of financial support of economic security, the level of external influence on the state of economic security (state regulation and supervision). In May 2018, representatives of the top management of various types of financial institutions, scientists, researchers, and analysts who were interested in the issues of economic security management of the financial sector were interviewed. Their answers were analysed and the level of readiness for managing the economic security of the most common types of financial institutions in the financial market of Ukraine was determined. Using the graphical method, the obtained scientific results are presented in a convenient and understandable form for the perception of all interested persons. Results of the survey. The necessity of carrying out diagnostics of the readiness to manage economic security at the level of state regulatory bodies and at the level of top management of financial institutions in the near future is substantiated. A large-scale analytical work was carried out on determining the parameters of financial institutions readiness for the continuous and professional economic security management, which should be carried out with the use of a systematic approach. Based on expert opinions, a preliminary assessment of the various types of financial intermediaries' readiness to integrate security-oriented management into the financial institutions' common management system was made. Practical implications. The proposed methodological approach for assessing the level of financial institutions readiness to manage their own economic security should be used by the state regulators of the financial market, in particular, by the National Bank of Ukraine and the National Commission, which performs state regulation in the field of financial services markets, to monitor the activities of professional financial market participants in order to conduct advisory and consultative work with their owners and managers, as well as for the development of strategic guidelines for the provision of the state financial security. It is desirable to implement into the practical activities of financial intermediaries our proposals for increasing the readiness for implementation of the economic security management mechanism in the existing systems of management. Value/originality. For the first time, a scoring methodology was prepared for assessing the level of financial institutions readiness for the implementation of economic security management as an independent direction of management, and not as one of the tasks of other types of their management activity. At the theoretical level, the substantive interpretation of the notion of the readiness of financial institutions to manage their own economic security is proposed. The reasons for the impossibility of the modern financial institutions to manage their own economic security effectively are identified, and a few suggestions to minimize their number in the near future were made.

The results show that the overseas market-oriented strategy affects the investment performance and it is also indirectly adjusted by the access path. The investment performance of the M&A firms that adopt the domestic-oriented strategy is better than that of the newly established ones. The investment performance of M&A is particularly prominent. The investment performance of newly established firms that adopt the export-oriented strategy is better than that of the M & A ones, and the investment performance of newly-built wholly-owned enterprises is particularly prominent. This conclusion provides theoretical support for Chinese enterprises entering overseas to match the appropriate market strategy and mode of entry.

J	Zheng, M				Zheng, Mo			THE EFFECTS OF REDLINING IN SINGAPORE'S RED-LIGHT DISTRICT	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						redlining; housing market; hedonic regression; mortgage financing; empirical analysis	COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT; DISCRIMINATION; PRICES; POLICY; PLACE; CITY	There are cities or regions with legal red-light districts in both developed and developing countries, but there are also regions or countries with no clear rules regarding prostitution. Financing issues in red-light districts represent another aspect rarely examined in the academic world. Most research studies about redlining are focused on racial or poverty levels, but this paper investigates it in relation to moral issues concerning vice activities. The objectives of this paper are to firstly analyse the red-light phenomenon in relation to sales prices and rent prices, secondly to test the redlining effect on property markets. This paper contributes to the current academic literature. The research setting of this paper is Geylang, Singapore, a place known for its centralized location, 24/7 stores, historic locales and prostitution-related business. The results indicate that the existence of Singapore's red-light district has a negative effect on both residential purchase prices and rent levels. The results also indicate that there exists a redlining effect since the home prices have a much higher discount than rents.

Because many sensor nodes access a channel, co-channel interference limits the number of nodes who can access it. To suppress co-channel interference, a frequency spectrum (or channel) is required to obtain large diversity and spreading gains. Cognitive radio with transmit power control exploits available channels because, in this approach, the co-channel interference on the primary system is suppressed and spectrum sharing between the primary system and a secondary system is possible. Prolonging a node's life is also important in wireless sensor networks. However, in simultaneous data gathering, the power consumed by the relay station (cluster head) is quite high. In this article, a method for constructing a cluster head selection and rotation that is optimal for increasing the number of available channels and prolonging the life of the node is proposed. In simultaneous data gathering, the link with the minimum number of available channels is the bottleneck. Our proposed technique achieves the maximum number of available channels and extends the life of the nodes because of the cluster head rotation. In addition, the optimal number of clusters is also determined.

However, results depend largely on the specifics of the knowledge problem and, in particular, on the ability to produce high-quality benchmarking corpora that may support the training and evaluation of automatic prediction systems. Annotation tools enabling the flexible and customizable production of such corpora are thus pivotal. The open-source Markyt annotation environment brings together the latest web technologies to offer a wide range of annotation capabilities in a domain-agnostic way. It enables the management of multi-user and multi-round annotation projects, including inter-annotator agreement and consensus assessments. Also, Markyt supports the description of entity and relation annotation guidelines on a project basis, being flexible to partial word tagging and the occurrence of annotation overlaps. This paper describes the current release of Markyt, namely new annotation perspectives, which enable the annotation of relations among entities, and enhanced analysis capabilities. Several demos, inspired by public biomedical corpora, are presented as means to better illustrate such functionalities. Markyt aims to bring together annotation capabilities of broad interest to those producing annotated corpora. Markyt demonstration projects describe 20 different annotation tasks of varied document sources (e.g. abstracts, twitters or drug labels) and languages (e.g. English, Spanish or Chinese). Continuous development is based on feedback from practical applications as well as community reports on short-and medium-term mining challenges. Markyt is freely available for non-commercial use at http://markyt.org.

Accordingly, it is required to consider and calculate their roles in implementing strategies. In terms of employees' role in the organization, they have managerial (goal setter) and/or non-managerial (non-goal setter) role. We are looking for a strategic performance measurement method to involve both roles. Since there was not a pervasive method in the literature to cover both roles properly, this research introduces a method that measures and calculates the strategic performance of employees based on two main parts: Project effectiveness (for managerial roles) and project efficiency (for non-managerial roles). This method tested on a sample of employees in Hormozgan Cement Company. Results show a significant difference between employees who participated and those who did not participate in implementation of strategies in their performance value. Achieved values are tangible and traceable; therefore, employees can have a proper sense and reaction to outputs of this method.

Rice Production in the Flood Plains of River Benue, Nigeria: Prospects and Challenges	MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article						Food security; land evaluation; Nigeria; rice		There exist opportunities to increase rice production in Nigeria as currently rice production is low and consumption level is high. The floodplains of river Benue offer great potential for sustainable large scale rice production. Twenty-five thousand hectares of land bordering river Benue were selected to assess the fertility, texture and drainage status of the soil for rice production, and to suggest possible soil management practices for optimising rice production. Standard field sampling methodologies and soil laboratory procedures were employed. The soils of the area were found suitable for rice production but with certain identified constraints. Apart from the low soil nutrient status of the floodplain, which could be easily mediated with fertiliser application, the most critical limitation related to poor drainage and flooding. To avert this problem, it is recommended that a proper drainage network be designed and executed along with the construction of strategic embankments to prevent flooding of the river Benue.

Selected factors that influence successful strategic planning in South African higher education	INDEPENDENT JOURNAL OF TEACHING AND LEARNING			English	Article						strategic planning; sustainability reporting; Higher Education Institutions (HEIs); Business Intelligence (BI); monitoring and evaluation; leadership; management		The objective of this investigation is to examine selected factors that contribute to successful strategic planning in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in South Africa. Organisations, including HEIs, that wish to achieve their objectives in the current fast-changing operating environment should formulate and implement strategic plans. The King III Report on corporate governance stresses the need for leaders to take responsibility for defining the strategies of their organisations. Existing literature has identified some factors that influence the success or failure of strategic planning. However, the extent to which these factors influence-if at all-strategic planning in South African HEIs remains unclear. The importance attached to these factors in South African universities is compared with their international counterparts. In carrying out this investigation, online questionnaires were completed and returned by 108 participants comprising Registrars and Information Managers at 23 South African HEIs and Information Managers in selected international higher education institutions. Data analysis entailed both descriptive and inferential statistics. Correlational analysis of the results confirmed that factors such as management buy-in and the availability of Business Intelligence (BI) reports were positively related to effective strategic planning and vice versa. Similarly, a strong correlation was observed between the presence of reporting guidelines and strategic planning. Other factors that strongly emerged as being positively related to successful strategic planning include: consultation during the strategic planning process as well as visible and strong leadership.

J	Ciobanu, OM				Ciobanu, Oana M.			Media, medical intelligence and hybrid war	ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF MILITARY MEDICINE			English	Article								Contemporary hybrid war is a novelty in that it is taken to populated conflict zones, with the participation of the population, under the eyes of the international community. Thus, according to many authors, the most serious threats to the United States, including to its NATO dimension and to its partnership with Europe, would come from extremist groups and their ideology, fueled by poor urban areas of the world, where youth faces great economic and social problems, and is militating for a change. These unconventional actors can operate beyond state control by circumventing international borders, norms and agreements. Some of these belong to global terrorist networks, and others cooperate with criminal elements to destabilize certain areas. The hybrid confrontation with these groups will become "a clash beyond the physical elements of the conflict, in which media manipulation, the use of the internet and the integration of information operations with strategic communication programs are as important as weapon systems on the battlefield." Crises generated in the context of a hybrid war are events characterized by low probability and important consequences that threaten an organization for its most profound purposes. Because of their low probability, these events defy any interpretation and require a sustained effort to understand and adapt the reactions. Crises affecting social groups differ in their causes and duration. Obviously, because of the multitude of types of crises, human reason can only play a limited role in their development. However, they trigger human action, which can turn small deviations into major crises. Crisis and conflict management involves very complex systems of political, diplomatic, social, economic, cultural, international, military and other actions. Such a system could be structured on political, diplomatic, social, economic, informational, military, psychological and cultural components and could include the following types of action: on the causes; on effects; on the phenomenon; on value systems; on crisis-generating strongpoints (critical areas); on vulnerable sites; on the leaders.

The relevance of the considered subject is determined, first of all, by the fact that in our rapidly changing world only the countries that can effectively develop talented youth have strategic advantages to use its potential. Empirical research data are presented in this article, theoretic-methodological approaches to a phenomenon of "talent" have been analyzed that allows us to define talented youth as the phenomenon characterized by a combination of abilities, successfully used for self achievement of good results in certain areas. So features and the prospects of development of talented youth in modern conditions are defined here. The results of studying the factors and features of development of talent and talented youth can be useful for the key directions of the state youth policy.

The Restructuring Energy Companies	MODERN JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE TEACHING METHODS			English	Article						restructuring; a restructuring method; arestructuring model; a scenario approach		In this article authors offer an advanced method of restructuring the company with use of a scenario analysis method. This method considers many economic events and processes, unlike traditional approaches to restructuring which not always allow us to analyze and adequately react to the changing environmental conditions. For this reason by search of modern methodology which could analyze and consider adequately economic processes, it is offered to pay attention to the changes management theory. This theory is used in the method of restructuring the company offered by authors, namely, in article one of the main categories of the changes management theory - restructuring is considered. Authors suggest using the scenario analysis within strategic planning. It allows to predict possible alternative conditions of economic system and to consider volatility of the external environment for a certain period, to consider various events in the economic environment. In this article the offered technique is considered on the example of JSC Generation Company which realizes activity in the field of power system of the Republic of Tatarstan. On the example of JSC Generation Company the technique of restructuring the enterprise, with use of a scenario method is described.

J	Donaldson, WJ; Pauceanu, AM				Donaldson, Walter James; Pauceanu, Alexandrina Maria			MARKETING CHALLENGES FOR SOUTH AFRICAN PUBLIC SECTOR BUSINESS INCUBATOR	JOURNAL OF COMPETITIVENESS			English	Article						business incubators; economic development; entrepreneurship; sustainability	MANAGEMENT; ENTREPRENEURS	Entrepreneurship and innovation form the cornerstone of economic development in many developing countries. Through this, rather ideal combination employment can be enhanced, communities can be uplifted through education, and growth can be increased through discretionary purchasing power. This cycle has positive spinoffs which can alleviate poverty and decrease famine. Recent local research suggests that more than eighty percent of entrepreneurs, start-ups and Business 'Incubatees' don't make it through their first year of establishment after leaving a Business Incubator programme. This paper tries to identify some of the marketing challenges faced by Business Incubators, and indeed BIMs in the Public Sector environment in South Africa. Identification and highlighting the possible drawbacks for 'incubatees' may assist them with success or meeting competitive challenges when they depart from the security of the relevant programmes. This study examines some of the skills, knowledge and attributes required for BIMs in this sector and what is required to meet the business and marketing challenges faced to remain sustainable. The survey was aimed at the largest, focused segment of South African Business Incubators affiliated to the industrial public sector and the hypothesis was to prove that strategic marketing information, acumen and knowledge is a key differentiator towards the growth and sustainability of Business Incubators in that sector. It is notable that these marketing challenges may also compare favourably with several other public sector segments in relevant countries of the southern African region as similar macroeconomic challenges are faced.

J	Gabriel, DS; Anindityo, AW				Gabriel, Djoko Sihono; Anindityo, Albertus Wahyu			DEVELOPMENT OF STAKEHOLDER ROLES IN SUPPORTING MATERIAL VALUE CONSERVATION OF PLASTIC PACKAGING USING BRAIN-WRITING AND INTERPRETIVE PROCESS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Brain-writing; Interpretive process; Material value conservation; Mechanical recycling; Plastic packaging; Stakeholder role	INVOLVEMENT; WASTE	According to the material-value-conservation paradigm, all material should not be considered to be marginal material, but rather to be valuable resource of which its value should be conserved. Degradation of material value may be prevented by designing for material value conservation that will support easier and faster processes for mechanical recycling; this will produce better quality of product and improve its financial viability. Therefore, it supports resource conservation schemes for plastic materials, reduces material waste, and also promotes a new method of environmental protection. A material value conservation implementation needs appropriate and strategic stakeholder roles in order to optimize the line of sight among stakeholders. Brain-writing and interpretive-process techniques of analysis were implemented in this research by interviewing competent resource persons representing every category of stakeholder (including government institutions, such as the regulator and law-enforcement agencies; plastic-packaging producers; plastic-packaging purchasers; plastic-waste collectors, and plastic recyclers), and then analyzing their responses to determine the appropriate strategic roles. Results of the two methods suggest a list of stakeholders with their strategic roles being to support the material-value-conservation aims in the context of quality and value of plastic-waste improvements, as well as increasing the quantity of waste accepted by plastic recyclers. Stakeholder roles provided valuable information and directions for implementing management of plastic materials and plastic packaging products, as well as its post-consumer materials as valuable waste. The new paradigm, which is supported by the appropriate roles of stakeholders will have a broader impact and provide more benefits through optimizing plastic-waste utilization, especially for regions with high density of people and high consumption rate of plastic packaging products.

Today's rapid advance in applied science and technology has not only removed problems of daily activities such as transportation, communication, information exchange etc, but also has greatly improved our comfort and lifestyle. Despite such major benefits brought by globalization, mankind is facing higher levels of competition and the struggle for success is becoming intense in almost all professional fields such as research, medicine, commerce, management, production technology and intellectual property rights to name a few. As a result, our progress can be obscured by normal human tendencies to quickly achieve the desired results in short time, thus sacrificing on quality and other values that inevitably lead to failure and frustration due to possible conflicts. This paper sheds light on ancient Hindu philosophy, namely the Bhagavad-geetha (popularly known as the Bhagavad-Gita), and attempts to correlate certain successful strategic decisions and guidelines made in the past - with the modern day human activity management by expounding the similarities in both situations. Such profound knowledge of the 'Geetha may not necessarily be restricted solely to religious grounds, but also applied as insights to the modern-day human interaction, perception and behavioral transactions to not only achieve success but primarily to eliminate personal differences and conflicts.

J	Li, YQ; Su, Y				Li, Yinqi; Su, Yi			Dynamic Credibility Evaluation on High-tech Enterprise Partners in Knowledge Collaboration Using a SPA-Markov Model	EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						high-tech enterprises; knowledge collaboration; credibility; dynamic evaluation	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; TRUST; SELECTION; INDUSTRY; UNIVERSITIES; ATTRIBUTES; ALGORITHM; BEHAVIOR; FIRMS; RISK	An evaluation on high-tech enterprise research and development (R&D) is of great necessity for boosting innovative economy and high-tech industry in the era of knowledge economy. However, high-tech enterprises cannot fully understand their partners' R&D capabilities and cooperative tendencies due to information asymmetry. Driven by interest, opportunistic behaviors might emerge, reducing trust and affecting efficient R&D cooperation. To explore R&D partners' credibility and avoid opportunistic behaviors, this study establishes an evaluation index system on the credibility of high-tech enterprise partners based on literature extraction and law relationship. The SPA-Markov Model has been adopted to dynamically evaluate the credibility in knowledge collaboration. Finally, HS, the China FAW Tooling Die Manufacturing's partner, is case-studied to verify feasibility of the model. The results are as follows: (1) Social environment, partner competence, partnership and collaborative potential are key indexes measuring partner credibility. (2) The SPA-Model Model could figure out changes and trends of the credibility. (3) The credibility of high-tech enterprise partners might fluctuate in collaboration. According to the study, the SPA-Model Model is feasible for assessing the credibility, which makes up for static evaluation and provides novel ideas on evaluation and optimization of high-tech enterprise partners.

Toward a Process for Engineering the Army Training System	IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						Enterprise systems engineering (ESE); process; systems engineering; training; training management	SCIENCE	Training is a fundamental human activity practiced by corporations, governments, and the Army. In today's military, training management is based on processes developed in WWII. Training is managed as a collection of similar activities, much the way it has been done for over 60 years. However, military training is more than a collection of activities, it is an enterprise system. This paper uses the emerging field of enterprise systems engineering (ESE) to develop a model that emphasizes the systems aspects of the training enterprise, while verifying the linkage from the strategic and operational goals of the Army to producing trained soldiers with the necessary skills. ESE includes the socio-economic-politico-technical context of complex systems while maintaining the rigor of systems engineering analysis. The result is a structured framework that highlights the importance of well-articulated training requirements and linking of those requirements to the implementation of training through the fundamental systems activities of systems analysis and training design.

J	Rahmatdin, MN; Abdul Rahman, NSF; Othman, MK				Rahmatdin, Muhamad Nasir; Abdul Rahman, Noorul Shaiful Fitri; Othman, Mohammad Khairuddin			An Empirical Study on the Current Feeder Shipping Network Patterns among Malaysian Feeder Service Providers	ASIAN JOURNAL OF SHIPPING AND LOGISTICS			English	Article						Feeder Network Design; Feeder Route Pattern; Maritime Studies; Empirical Study; Maritime Economy; Malaysia Feeder Industry	DESIGN	Route network patterns have been investigated globally by many researchers, with the majority of studies only focussing on the liner shipping industry for long-distance services, and with less attention paid to the feeder services industry. The feeder services industry is important to enhance the economic sustainability and viability of feeder service providers and trade partners. The primary objectives of this paper were to study the focal economy points of feeder services in Malaysia and to demonstrate the type of network patterns practised by Malaysian feeder service providers. Accordingly, an empirical study was conducted through the cooperation of eight Malaysian feeder service providers via face-to-face interviews and port visits to understand the patterns of each shipping route deployed. Moreover, to demonstrate the network patterns of each feeder service provider, a route network model was designed. The main finding from this study found that Port Klang was the primary feeder hub port and focal economy point in Malaysia due to the highest number of feeder vessels entering the port. Furthermore, the type of route patterns applied by Malaysian feeder service providers were determined and categorised based on three models: 75 % (basic model), 17.5 % (butterfly model), and 7.5 % (chain model) collected data consisting of 40 service routes. This paper will assist future and existing feeder service providers in their planning and execution of the optimal service routes regarding their efficiency in servicing existing and future customers and promoting strategic and tactical allocation of shipping services to specific ports.

This paper examines the relationship between bidding behavior and equilibrium excursion. We analyze a uniform price auction mechanism based on a rationing strategy and common value information. In this uniform price auction mechanism, bidders (strategic and non-strategic) participate in an auction simultaneously, and the auctioneer rations the strategic bidders after observing their bids. The conclusions drawn suggest that a rationing strategy can effectively limit the strategic bidders from manipulating the auction, and the Nash equilibrium may not be unique (i.e., there exists an equilibrium excursion). As the number of bidders increases, or when the quantity that can be allocated to the non-strategic bidders is unconstrained, there exists asymptotically a unique equilibrium price which is the highest price the auctioneer could obtain. Based on these conclusions, we provide some strategies and suggestions on how to induce the equilibrium excursion state to a desired unique equilibrium state.

J	Trovao, S				Trovao, Susana			From Vagrancy Heterotopias to the Proximity of Homelessness. A Historical Ethnography of the State's Moral Dilemmas in the Management of Unease	JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL SOCIOLOGY			English	Article								This paper discusses the tension between the criminal justice system and the welfare state as expressed through practices focused on populations who are perceived as being at risk' and constituting a danger' to society, therefore challenging the national governance of social precariousness and public (in)security. The analysis of a paradigmatic institution of Portuguese Fascism has brought to light how the contradictions between the long-term subjectivation of vagrancy processes and the uses of anti-vagrancy policies promoted by the dictatorial state to arrest and punish a significant part of his citizens may justify the moral dilemmas underlying the current Portuguese State's response to homelessness and urban marginality.

J	Vieira, LC; Amaral, FG				Vieira, Leticia Canal; Amaral, Fernando Goncalves			BARRIERS AND CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS APPLYING CLEANER PRODUCTION: A SURVEY WITH BRAZILIAN SPECIALISTS	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Pollution prevention; Stakeholders; South America; Principal Components Analysis	MANAGEMENT; PAY	Cleaner Production is an initiative seeking for achieving sustainable development goals. Yet, it has not been satisfactorily disseminated in Brazilian industries. The purpose of this article was identifying the barriers and critical success factors, considering both the external and internal Brazilian environment. A survey was conducted among the professionals involved with the subject of Cleaner Production in Brazil, reaching 185 respondents. Data was analyzed using the Principal Component Analysis. The results indicated that the main success factors concern the organization characteristics, and are related to culture, strategic planning and resources for the implementation of Cleaner Production. In the case of barriers, it can be highlighted the inadequate vision and culture of organizations, followed by the lack of support from the external environment. Contrary to other studies, economic aspects did not seem to be crucial in the opinion of respondents. When measures that can be taken for a more effective dissemination of CP in Brazil are approached, it can be perceived that a repositioning of the external environment (government, other companies, academia, and consumers) is necessary, acting as a strong incentive and support for applying CP.

J	White, B; Cossham, A				White, Bruce; Cossham, Amanda			Partnerships or parallel lines? The contributions of practitioners and academics to library and information research	INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Research Applications, Information and Library Studies (RAILS)	DEC 06-08, 2016	Wellington, NEW ZEALAND	Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Informat Management			FACULTY STATUS; COLLABORATION; SCIENCE; CULTURE	Introduction. Academic libraries are seeking to extend their roles beyond traditional document provision and knowledge discovery into such areas as strategic research support, research data management and scholarly publishing. Consequently, more academic librarians will need to develop a robust understanding of the scholarly research process as experienced by academics. This paper examines a sample of recent articles in established library and information studies (LIS) journals to identify the comparative contributions of librarians (practitioners) and academics and the extent of collaboration between these groups, based on jointly written articles. Method. Journals were drawn from the Scimago Library and Information Sciences list and an algorithm was used to identify authors of individual papers as practising librarians or library and information studies (LIS) academics, or both (joint authorship). Keywords were extracted and aggregated by author category to identify the subject interests of these two groups. Analysis. Keywords were manually clustered, and filtered using Excel, to determine the topics of most interest to the different groups of authors. Results. Analysis of keywords highlights the different spheres of interest each group has, and questions the degree of alignment between the scholarly literature and the widely-recognised preoccupations of the field. The results indicate striking differences as well as broad areas of common interest. Conclusion. Currently, the two groups (practitioners and academics) are running on parallel, or even diverging, lines in their respective approaches to the practice of research within their shared discipline.

An analysis of existing articles shows that the research of talent development mainly relates to the following aspects: cultivating objectives, cultivator, cultivation way, and evaluation criteria. In recent years, with the continuous improvement of education system in China and the increased awareness of talents, the talent construction of key discipline in science and technology has been greatly improved. With the actuality and circumstance analysis of the talent construction of key disciplines, a talent planning model is proposed to the key disciplines in science and technology. The proposed model is III-level tree structure, of which there are 2 I-level indexes, 8 II-level indexes and 23 III-level indexes. The Analytic Hierarchy Process is employed to determine the weights of talent planning indexes. This research will make the more scientific, systematic, strategic talent planning, and adapt to the development needs of key disciplines.

J	Yusgiantoro, P				Yusgiantoro, Purnomo			Developing Indonesia's Basic Defense Forces	KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS			English	Article						basic defense forces; threat; strategic environment; budget; defense cooperation	SOUTH CHINA SEA; WAR	The national resources of Indonesia have a major influence in developing the nation's basic defense forces. The state's capacity to provide budgetary and human resources is a major determining factor in building the nation's basic defense forces. Indonesia is currently not able to leapfrog into the development of ideal defense forces directly due to constraints on national resources. Thus, the first step is to focus on developing basic defense forces until the national resources are sufficiently able to support the development of ideal defense forces. Basic defense forces should be able to counteract not only fundamental threats (e.g. open warfare), but also increasingly non-traditional threats, current and potential, to the nation. An assessment of these non-traditional threats, namely terrorism, cyber attacks, maritime security and internal disturbances, is important in order to design basic defense forces, and it begins with a look at the dynamics of the strategic environment that results in changes in the shape and spectrum of threats. A key geopolitical concern is that the development of basic defense forces is not meant to bring the region into an arms race situation. Rather, pursuing multilateralism and building regional security architecture through international bodies such as ASEAN are crucial to designing basic defense forces to successfully eliminate non-traditional threats, as these are increasingly racing to the forefront of not just national, but also regional, security concerns. This paper will explore how Indonesia builds its basic defense forces with a focus on countering common non-threat traditional threats. In order to build basic defense forces, the strategic environment, the state's budgetary constraints, the progress of regional defense cooperation and the anatomy of common threats must be understood first.

Rather than handling these two problems separately, we formulate them into an integrated system. A real-coded genetic algorithm is applied to minimize the estimated transport time in terms of distance, and the disparity between resource supply and demand. A set of scenarios is simulated and analyzed to provide insight for policy makers. Further, the simulated results can be used for future post-disaster medical assistance training.

Social network analysis (SNA) methodology was used to examine networks in three sectors, which were found to differ in terms of centrality measures and substructures. In the private sector network, centrality values of network members were related to their respective positions in the organisational hierarchy. In the politics network, centrality measures values of members were influenced both by hierarchy and by the number of same-party members. In the NGO network, all members had high centrality values. Substructure sizes were low in the private sector and high in the NGO sector; in the politics network, they were dependent on the number of same-party members.

The Strategic Analysis of Driving Forces Determining Success for a Console Manufacturer in the Console Market - the Positioning Strategy of Nintendo	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Strategy Management	SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT; INDIA; BANGLADESH; COAST	Though the console market is steadily growing, the competition is very fierce. A variety of key factors get involved in the successful survival in the console market, including branding, cost, exclusive games, innovation, online feature, price, reliability, third parties support, technology, and timing. However, it is not easy to sustain the competitive advantages in an extremely fierce console market with other strong competitors for a long time, if there is not any change to console manufacturers. In addition to keep the original strength, Nintendo applies the most appropriate strategy to sustain its competitive advantages in the next generation.	[Lee, S.

J	Shen, B; Ke, YW				Shen, Bo; Ke, Youwei			Causes analysis and risk control of firm knowledge loss	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge loss; Internal factors; External factors; Risk control	TURNOVER; MODEL	With the globalization of the knowledge economy, knowledge management appears especially important for firms, and has been applied in more and more companies. Knowledge resource has become the key point of the firm's core competence, while knowledge loss is the problem that can be easily ignored, and has a great effect on firms. In this paper, we define the concept of knowledge loss, the main risks of the firm faced in knowledge loss at first, and then analyze the causes of firm knowledge loss from the internal factors and the external factors. The internal factors include employee turnover, internal staff changes, performance evaluation and salary structure. The external factors consist of the external imitation, corporate strategic alliance and social environment. And finally we put forward corresponding risk control strategies.

Educational goals are generally transcendental, ideal, and useful because the educational system intends to educate those who have a social, scientific and ethical development, and have the skills to play a proper role in society. Hence, teaching in educational institutions in an effective manner will not only affect the performance of the institution, but also affect the performance of individuals at all levels. In this research, the relationship between effective teaching components and organizational performance will be investigated. This research is descriptive survey and in terms of its purpose. Measurement of strategic performance in four years (financial, learning, stakeholder, and internal process).

Under heavy competitive environment and political/economic uncertainties of countries, it is possible to say that it becomes a necessity to have strategic plans in order to overcome possible obstacles, set competitive advantage and achieve corporate goals. Due to their crucial position with the managerial team, corporate communication departments of organizations play a key role during implementation of strategic plans in various phases. Aim of this study is to understand the role of corporate communication units during different stages of strategic plans in top level companies. In this study, after giving brief information about strategic planning and its advantages to organizations, role of corporate communication departments in strategic management process will be discussed. Later, strategic planning practices of city of Kayseri's companies that were in the top 1000 in Istanbul Chamber of Industry list in 2015 will be focused in terms of corporate communication axis. Only 16 companies accepted to participate in the study although 28 companies existed in the list. Study showed that besides its various benefits, companies found strategic planning as a bureaucratic and time-demanding activity. Most of the companies didn't share their strategic plans in their corporate web-sites. Meetings and e-mails were the most popular tools while communicating shareholders in every stage of plans. Majority of the companies had crisis management, social responsibility and corporate reputation strategies in their plans; however, only a small group had sponsorship strategies.	[Gorkemli, H.

J	Iqbal, S; Khan, N				Iqbal, Shahid; Khan, Nawar			Effectiveness and Future Prospects of Telemedicine/Remote Health Care Management Applications in Pakistan	MEHRAN UNIVERSITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Engineering Management; Operational Assessment; Medical/Health Care; Health Services Management; Public Hospital in Pakistan	ACCEPTANCE	Medical/Health care system is spraining in Pakistan because of innovative technology, activities and services as per their financial cost (position) which is increasing day by day. This research is intended for the assessment of Telemedicine/Remote Health Care Management practices (system), which encompasses usability, acceptance and impact in public/private hospitals. To improve the existing remote health care/telemedicine practices in Pakistan by using EM (Engineering Management) based approach. It has been widely and successfully implemented and is considered as a strategic and operational tool. In the 21stcentury due to the Technological advancements the mode of operation of service and business sector have been changed drastically. In the same way the health sectors activities also have been altered, new methods and techniques have also been devised for the treatment of the patients that were never even thought before. In the health sector Telemedicine/Remote Health Care Management is one of the development which was experienced lately. Telemedicine/Remote Health Careistaken exactly,"medicine at a distance". Therefore, hypothetically, some procedures performed with medication which does not take place "face-to-face" and "in person" which can be considered as Telemedicine/Remote Health Care. In the industrialized world telemedicine is being used in full capacity to provide the health care services to remote and un-accessible areas. But Telemedicine/Remote Health Care Management is not very popular and admired in Pakistan; few applications are being functional presently.

The data consists of 16 locations for the period from 1957 to 2012. But some of observations are missing for some locations. Thus we propose a heuristic method to impute the missing values. It is a modified EM algorithm with robust estimation of conditional expectation. The method takes account into the spatial dependency between locations of weather stations. After the estimated missing values are included to complete data, we fitted stationary and non-stationary Gumbel and GEV distributions. Among these models, the best model is selected based on the likelihood ratio test for each station. Using the selected model, return values for several return periods are obtained and contour plots are drawn. A cluster analysis is conducted based on the estimated return levels. The information obtained from our study is useful for the agencies involved in water management in terms of strategic planning and the prevention of flood, related to public safety.

J	Kulkki, S				Kulkki, Seija			Cities for New Growth and Socio-Economic Dynamism? The Case of Smart Cities and RDI-Driven Participative Democracy and Governance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE DIGITAL AGE			English	Article						Democracy and Governance; Participative RDI; Smart Cities; Socioeconomic Development	KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE	The article argues for a strategic role for cities and regions in renewing the social and economic foundations of societies, locally and globally. The cities offer an opportunity to develop - through their own strategic RDI - new human-centric social and economic dynamism for the wellbeing of human beings and the Nature. The article elaborates on sources of growth, value and wealth creation that are based on strategic RDI of cities and city-regions with firms, public agencies and citizens. This RDI may bring about new social and economic activities and means of solving major societal challenges. The article discusses (1) how to design for transformative RDI, (2) what are the forms of participative RDI and their impact on participative democracy, (3) what are the new mechanisms of governance that reflect the central role of cities in societal renewal, and (4) what is the impact of cities on overall entrepreneurial spirit, economic efficiency, and wealth creation?

As part of the initiatives for that, the procurement division has been practicing green purchasing since 2001. This involves ensuring product compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and providing support for clients with their environmental activities. Specifically, we request our suppliers to have an environmental management system (EMS), and ensure the products we deliver contain no regulated chemical substances. We also request them to have a chemical substance management system (CMS). In keeping with a global awareness of environmental issues, our environmental activities also encompass the reduction of CO2 emissions, protection of biodiversity, and conservation of water resources. This paper describes the performance of the procurement division in the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan (Stage VII) and our efforts to mitigate CO2 emissions across the supply chain, which is one of the goals set forth in the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan (Stage VIII) that started in FY2016.

J	Rexwinkel, T; Haenen, J; Pilot, A				Rexwinkel, Trudy; Haenen, Jacques; Pilot, Albert			The validity and reliability of the cross-national comparison of degree programme levels in European countries. What have students learnt?	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION			English	Article						Bachelor's degree programme; Cross-national; Validity; Reliability Factor analysis; Quality assurance	QUALITY-ASSURANCE; HIGHER-EDUCATION; MANAGEMENT	A cross-national comparison of degree programme levels became relevant when the borders of European countries opened for students and graduates, and higher education institutions were restructured into bachelor's and master's programmes. This new situation foregrounded the questions of what students are learning in the degree programmes of European countries and how to compare their achievements. Therefore, we conceptualised a valid and reliable 'level' construct that included a cognitive ('disciplinary thinking') and an affective aspect ('professional attitude'). The main research question for our exploratory study was: 'What procedure can lead to a valid and reliable cross-national comparison of degree programme levels?' To achieve this comparison, we designed a Three-Step Procedure, in which level was operationalised (step 1), measured and analysed (step 2), and compared cross-nationally (step 3). The study was conducted in collaboration with four bachelor programmes in Hotel Management from four European countries; a total of 783 participants were involved. Four themes were generated to operationalise the concept of level: professional management, hospitality business research, leading management, and strategic management; their respective learning outcomes were measured with a questionnaire. Principal component analysis identified the conceptualised themes and measured their components with eigenvalues ae<yen>1, which explained 66 % of the variance. The reliability of the components exceeded a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.70. Analysis of the components and of the single samples showed strong validity and reliability for the learning outcomes. Thus, we believe this study has produced a rigorous means to compare degree programme levels across countries.

However, what has not been studies is how some of the new models have relied upon international business alliances in order to improve the public services provided. A qualitative analysis, based on case studies of alliances between Colombian and Spanish companies, have been performed to help address this question. The results indicate that the changes in local policies have not only improved the public services but, with the agreements signed, a strong and agile partnership has been achieved.

In the same time it is. big future challenge, considering that waste problems could be transferred into benefits by using its potentials. Skopje is a capital and the largest city of Macedonia. Despites some improvement in waste management, particularly in a part of waste infrastructure, the situation is far from satisfactory. The level of primary municipal waste selection and collection is still very low and. big portion of waste is collected as. mix waste stream. The system of sustainable waste management is not established yet. This produces a slow growth of recycling and other forms of recovery. In the area of commercial waste, the conditions in terms of primary waste selection and collection are slightly better. However the most portion of waste ends to the landfills without a pretreatment. Additionally private and informal sectors are not included in the system. The determined objectives from the strategic and planning documents and regulations adopted by central and local government are not realized. In the future it should be undertaken a wide set of short term, midterm and long term measures and activities for establishing sustainable waste management. A main goal of this paper is to analyze and to research the various aspects of waste management in Skopje and to give some recommendations for its improvement.

This stresses the need for efficient ways of integrating these data in a coherent description of biological systems. In many cases, biological data needs organization before integration. This is not seldom a collaborative effort, and it is thus important that tools for data integration support a collaborative way of working. Wiki systems with support for structured semantic data authoring, such as Semantic MediaWiki, provide a powerful solution for collaborative editing of data combined with machine-readability, so that data can be handled in an automated fashion in any downstream analyses. Semantic MediaWiki lacks a built-in data import function though, which hinders efficient round-tripping of data between interoperable Semantic Web formats such as RDF and the internal wiki format. Results: To solve this deficiency, the RDFIO suite of tools is presented, which supports importing of RDF data into Semantic MediaWiki, with metadata needed to export it again in the same RDF format, or ontology. Additionally, the new functionality enables mash-ups of automated data imports combined with manually created data presentations. The application of the suite of tools is demonstrated by importing drug discovery related data about rare diseases from Orphanet and acid dissociation constants from Wikidata. The RDFIO suite of tools is freely available for download via pharmb. io/project/rdfio. Conclusions: Through a set of biomedical demonstrators, it is demonstrated how the new functionality enables a number of usage scenarios where the interoperability of SMW and the wider Semantic Web is leveraged for biomedical data sets, to create an easy to use and flexible platform for exploring and working with biomedical data.

The company has seized this opportunity to renew its vision in order to increase its social impact and generate new sources of earned and contributed income. During in-depth discussions at the board level, executive director Alain Dancyger demonstrated that the company's growth was limited by its dominant position in a stagnant market and a lack of growth potential in its core business, both at home and abroad. The company needed to renew its vision by enriching the customer experience and using dance as a tool to promote health and well-being. The board agreed that the renewed vision would have a positive impact on the company's brand image. The authors describe how an arts organization can introduce new services and increase its earned and contributed income by doing social good.

The research was conducted with a sample of 306 respondents comprised of owners, pharmacists and customers. We sought to assess the extent of gaps regarding competitive, strategic and operational dysfunctions, checking which are significant and the results of the service provided in relation to competitive factors valued by customers. The data collection instrument was a questionnaire validated model as SERVQUAL, published by Parasuraman et al. (1988). The statistical analysis used the software BioEstat v.05. The results demonstrate that there is a strong adhesion of the samples obtained and the quality dimension that stood out was reliability. In relation to the dysfunctions researched, the results pointed to a perfect interaction between agents which led us to accept that, as part of the pharmacies researched, there is no significant competitive dysfunction.

J	Hayduk, TM				Hayduk, Theodore M., III			The Case for a Complete Model of Strategic Resource Utility in Sport and Entertainment Management	JOURNAL OF APPLIED SPORT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic management; resources; sport; entertainment	SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; VIEW; FIRM; SPONSORSHIP	A complete model of strategic resource utility can be useful for managers in the sport and entertainment industry. In recent years, this industry has been characterized by rapid evolution, high fragmentation, and ubiquitous digitalization, which all highlight the importance of making rapid and informed strategic decisions. Thus, the complete model will help managers quantify their firm's resource bundle and use a common language during the strategic decision making process. Two industry-specific examples are given to facilitate interpretation of the complete model.

J	Kim, HJ; Kim, BK				Kim, Hwan-Jin; Kim, Byung-Keun			Risk-based perspective on the choice of alliance governance in high-tech industries	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & ORGANIZATION			English	Article						alliances and joint ventures; risk perspectives; governance; transaction cost economics	JOINT VENTURE; INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS; BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY; CORPORATE PERFORMANCE; COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; PARTNER SELECTION; TRANSACTION COSTS; BARGAINING POWER; COOPERATION	This paper examines the influence of risks on alliance governance modes in high-tech industries. The extant literature has devoted little attention to the preferred governance mode based on the risks surrounding alliances. In this paper, we examine why risks are key factors in the alliance governance decision and investigate the choice of alliance governance mode in high-tech industries. Hypotheses are formulated based on risk perspectives; these hypotheses are empirically tested using data on 3,228 alliance records generated over the past 5 years in high-tech industries. The results suggest that risk perspectives provide an effective rationale for choosing an alliance governance mode in a high-tech industry. In the conclusion, we discuss critical issues in the current debates on predicting alliance governance modes.

A new health policy was also envisaged. Further impetus was provided by the emerging challenges, particularly those pertaining to high out of pocket expenditure and catastrophic expenditure on health. At the same time, global opportunities such as the adoption of Sustainable Development Goals combined with local positives such as the robust growth of healthcare industry in India and better fiscal capacity of the government also drove this ambition. The new National Health Policy 2017 is now adopted by the country and has been driven by the spirit of 'cooperative governance' and 'participatory approach'. This article details these background processes involved in the development of National Health Policy 2017 for India.

J	Lien, HH; Huang, CC; Huang, CS				Lien, Heng Hui; Huang, Chi Cheng; Huang, Ching Shui			A retrospective comparison of two-, three-, and four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomies	FORMOSAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						Cholecystectomy; laparoscopic; port	BILE-DUCT INJURY; 2-PORT	Purpose: A total of 1276 laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LCs) using two-, three-, and four-port methods were analyzed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of two and three-port LCs in management for acute or elective gallstone disease when compared with four-port LC. Materials and Methods: A between-group comparison was performed on the difference of operation time, postsurgery admission days, postsurgery daily pain score between acute or elective surgery or different procedures. Results: Proportion of four-port LC was significant high in acute then in elective surgery (93.3% vs. 79.0%; P = 0.001). In elective surgeries, difference among mean operative time of two-, three-, and four-port LC (36.76, 34.72, and 27.32 min, respectively) was statistically significant (P = 0.001). Three-port LC showed a significant lowest mean pain score (1.887; 1 to 10 point pain score) on the first-day post-LC.(P = 0.04) Difference on the mean post-LC hospitalization of two-, three-, and four-port LCs (2.158, 2.141 and 2.412 days, respectively) were significant in elective (P = 0.001) while not significant in acute surgery (two-, three-, and four-port LCs: 2.75, 2.778, and 3.097 days, respectively; P = 0.237). Conclusions: Four-port LC was the procedure of choice in acute surgery. The operative time was the shortest for four and longest for two-port LC. Three-port LC could be adopted using strategic selection (elective surgery) and conversion (with adding port) as safety guard for the benefits of less wound pain, decreased post-LC admission days.

Perceptions of the impact of an advanced training programme on the management skills of health professionals in Gauteng, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION			English	Article								Background. South Africa's health sector spans the private and the public sectors. Within the sectors, health managers take on strategic leadership roles without formal training in management or leadership - a trend more common in the public sector than the private sector. Health managers are selected based on their clinical skills rather than their leadership or management skills. Objective. To compare self-rated competencies in management and leadership before and after training of the participants; to assess participants' experience of the training programme; and to evaluate the management and leadership skills of the participants after training. Methods. A cross-sectional, descriptive analytical method and 360 degrees interviewing were used in this study. Participants were evaluated 18 months after completion of the training programme. A 360 degrees evaluation (360 degrees E) of six of the similar to 12 leadership/management competencies was done with the supervisors, colleagues, and subordinates of the participants. Results. All participants rated themselves as improved in 12 managerial and leadership competencies. The 360 degrees E affirmed five of these competencies as improved, with the ability to create and implement a marketing plan rating poorly. Conclusion. Training in management leads to improvement in both leadership and managerial skills of health professionals.

J	Sabeti, SM; Moghaghenia, H				Sabeti, Seyed Moayed; Moghaghenia, Hamed			Behavioral Pattern in the United States in the Face of Upheavals of Arab Countries	TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH			English	Article						United States; Security; Arab world; Stability; Middle East; Foreign policy; Power; Arab Countries; Arab spring; Hegemony		Conditions and upheavals, by their characteristics, including people opposition with governments and alteration in regional order, have challenged the US strategic interests in the Middle East region and forced the authorities of Washington to manage and strategize upheavals. The type of US encounter with the trend of upheavals, approach of the ruling regime, the future of people movement and available alternative, interests, and security of Israel and contradiction between strategic interests and democratic principles were amongst the most important issues facing the United States. The present article is seeking to find the answer to this question that what sort of relationship does exist between United States policies in the Middle East from one hand and recent upheavals in Arab countries on the other hand? The assumption of the article is that in the past two decades the one sided role of the US in forming the upheavals of Middle East has changed into a bilateral relationship and the behavior of this country in the process of recent upheavals, affected by the presence of the people of Arab countries in internal politics of their own country in numerous cases has changed into a reaction behavior. Finally, it should be said that contrasts between society and government in Arabic Middle East, is considered as one of the prominent challenges of the US in decision-making process and management of region unrests.

Flexible pipes for the reduction of tsunami wave load acting on oil and gas tanks are firehose-like pipes on a much larger scale that can be inflated with compressed air to form long vertical pipes when a tsunami occurs. These pipes can reduce the wave energy of the tsunami by energy dissipation similar to natural tsunami countermeasures such as mangroves and giant kelps. We developed flexible pipes by mimicking such biologically inspired tsunami protection mechanisms. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the development of flexible pipes and present the effectiveness of our pipes through experimental results. We designed the dimensions of the full-scale pipes. Then, we carried out laboratory-scale experiments in the tsunami wave flume using 1:100 scale pipes and an oil tank model and long-period tsunami-like waves. We measured the reduction of momentum flux carried by this wave behind our flexible pipes and the hydrodynamic forces acting on the oil tank model reduced by the flexible pipes in a direct manner. The experimental results suggested that around 50% of maximum momentum flux could be reduced behind the flexible pipes whereas 40% of maximum hydrodynamic force in inflow direction could be reduced compared to the case without flexible pipes. The difference is attributed to overflow of water above the model oil tank in the no pipes case.

J	Ying, C				Ying, Chen			International Debate Over Geoengineering and Geoengineering Governance	CHINESE JOURNAL OF URBAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES			English	Article						Geoengineering; carbon dioxide removal (CDR); solar radiation management (SRM); international governance		In the face of the severe challenge of global climate change, all countries find it difficult to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, let alone 1.5 degrees C. In recent years, geoengineering has gained increasingly more attention from the international community as an unconventional option to deal with climate change, and it has also provoked heated debates. This paper attempts to sort out related concepts, the focus of controversies and the research progress in terms of geoengineering, analyzes the international background of heated debate over geoengineering, probes into the governance of geoengineering under the framework of coping with climate change, and offers some suggestions for China to make strategic plans for geoengineering development.

THE EMERGENCE OF HEALTH TECHNOLOGY FIRMS THROUGH THEIR SENSEGIVING ACTIVITIES AND COMPETITIVE ACTIONS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Innovation in health; legitimacy; reputation-building; prominence; neo-institutional theory; actors; competitive actions; institutional pressures	REPUTATION; ORGANIZATIONS	Few studies have examined the process by which health technology innovators must socially construct their firm and share their ideas with economic and health system actors. To fill this gap, we intended to provide insights into the differences characterising the health technology startup (HTS) among other startups and test a conceptual model by characterising press releases and media coverage emanating from five firms (three HTS and one well-established firm, and one non-health information technology). Using a multiple case study design, with three embedded units of analysis composed of the startups' sensegiving intentions, its competitive actions and its strategic responses to pressures, we observed marked difference in the use of marketing and symbolic actions as well as recourse to prominent actors. Besides, health startups were the only ones relying on cognition rather than actors' self-interest or moral judgments. There were also differences depending on the startup status and the number of actors resulting in different response patterns to pressures. The findings are paving the way to further research on innovators and actor's inner thinking, which may contribute to shaping business development programs targeted specifically for health tech startups, and may help emerging entrepreneurs compare their evolution to health and non-health tech startups.

The concept of strategic political communication refers to an organization's purposeful management of information and communication to achieve certain political goals. In this article, we focus on the role of the individual political party in developing election campaigning. The empirical material covers the 2002, 2006, and 2010 Swedish national election campaigns and illustrates how political parties lead and follow each other in the development of strategic political communication. By exploring party agency, this article contributes to the understanding of how ideas and practices of strategic political communication emerge and develop over time in election campaigning.

The availability and access to private BDS providers is essential for MSMEs to learn and acquire new operations, marketing, management, resourcing, technology, and innovation skills. The research objective involves understanding BDS challenges and corresponding strategic actions adopted by BDS providers while serving the MSMEs. A qualitative multicase-based research methodology is applied to data collection and analysis. The experience of BDS providers studied here helps gauge provisioning across all countries. BDS challenges involve environmental complexity, lack of awareness and identity, decisions on the types of service offerings, scarcity of resources, and ethical dilemmas. The corresponding strategic actions are identified and mapped to the challenges faced by BDS providers.

J	Jereme, IA; Siwar, C; Begum, RA; Abdul, B				Jereme, Innocent A.; Siwar, Chamhuri; Begum, Rawshan Ara; Abdul, Basri			Food wastes and food security: The case of Malaysia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article						Food wastes; Food insecurity; Food security; Households; Sustainable food waste management	HOUSEHOLDS	Wasting foods is an affront to those in food insecurity. While thousands of these groups are in dare need of nutritious edible foods, households and restaurants alike are dumping large volumes of edible food wastes into waste bins on daily basis. The objectives of this study are to understand the need to use these large quantities of edible food wastes generated on daily basis by households, restaurants and hotels to reduce food insecurity among the poor households, the homeless and its other social impacts in Malaysia. This is because according to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Malaysia (MHLG), households food wastes volume alone is up to 8,745 tons/per day amounting to 3,192,404 tones/per year. These represent more than 38.32 percent of all total wastes generated: while restaurants generate 941,608 tones/per year, 23.35 percent. However, despite this wastage in Malaysia, previous studies on food security have shown that people in urban low-income households indicated prevalence of overall food insecurity at 65.7% to 66.6% respectively than 58% reported in the rural low-income communities. It is therefore imperative to the channel these foods through the establishment of food banks in some affluent and strategic location in the cities to reduce food insecurity and its environmental and social impacts on the society. Wasting foods have social, environment and economic impacts, and at the same time negates the effort towards sustainable food consumption which has for the last two decades becomes everyday discussions of societies at large.

We address the question of whether an operator should enter the mobile TV market and, if yes, how and when to do so. We perform a capacity and QoS analysis that shows that Mobile TV is not a simple added-on service but requires new planning strategies that need heavy investments. We consider two possible settings: a competitive mobile TV network where a digital video broadcasting (DVB) operator and a cellular network operator build their independent networks and a cooperative setting where the TV network is mainly relying on a DVB infrastructure whose coverage can be complemented by a cellular network. Two main issues alter the investment decision of the stakeholders, namely, the market uncertainty and the competition or the willingness of cooperation betweenthe main technological players. We define a game theoretical real options framework and propose a novel bi-level dynamic programming algorithm that solves the underlying profit maximization problem. Our numerical results illustrate the optimal investment decisions of both actors and the impact of the system parameters as well as the degree of uncertainty on the investment dates.

BSC (Balanced Scorecard) can be considered superior to previous approaches of strategic performance management that focus only on financial measures. Balanced Scorecard includes both financial and non-financial measures that drive future financial organization performances. The research questions, which this work provides answers to, is concerned by the level of awareness of 37 surveyed managers of small, medium and large companies in the Republic of Serbia with the BSC, then identifying the degree of BSC implementation in these companies, as well as the reasons for not adopting the BSC and tests which use similar performance measures	[Slavica, Tomic; Ljubica, Komazec] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subot, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Jelena, Jevtic] Higher Med & Business Technol Sch Appl Studies Sa, Sabac, Serbia		Jelena, J (corresponding author), Higher Med & Business Technol Sch Appl Studies Sa, Sabac, Serbia.	jelenajevtic@vtssa.edu.rs					[Anonymous], 2015, CRITERIA CLASSIFICAT; Arsic L., 2010, BIZINFO BLACE J EC M, V1, P1; Bean L., 2002, J CORPORATE ACCOUNTI, V13, P55; Bostan I, 2011, ROM J ECON FORECAST, V14, P178; Busco C, 2015, CONTEMP ACCOUNT RES, V32, P1236, DOI 10.1111/1911-3846.12105; Campbell D, 2015, J MANAG ACOUNT RES, V27, P39, DOI 10.2308/jmar-51209; Domanovic V., 2013, EKONOMSKI HORIZONTI, V15, P31; Domanovic V., 2011, NAUCNO DRUSTVO EKONO; Figge F, 2002, BUS STRATEG ENVIRON, V11, P269, DOI [10.1002/bse.339, DOI 10.1002/BSE.339]; Giannopoulos G., 2013, INT J BUSINESS MANAG, V8, P1; Gonzalez-Padron TL, 2010, BRIT J MANAGE, V21, P967, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8551.2009.00634.x; Kadarova J, 2014, PROCD SOC BEHV, V143, P168, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.07.381; KAPLAN RS, 1992, HARVARD BUS REV, V70, P71; Kotler P, 2006, MARKETING MENADZMENT; Krstic B., 2007, UPRAVLJANJE PERFORMA; Kunz RE, 2016, J MULTI-CRITERIA DEC, V23, P225, DOI 10.1002/mcda.1572; Lipe MG, 2000, ACCOUNT REV, V75, P283, DOI 10.2308/accr.2000.75.3.283; Madsen DO, 2015, ADM SCI, V5, P90, DOI 10.3390/admsci5020090; Nielsen S., 2015, ADV DECISION SCI, V2015, P1, DOI DOI 10.1155/2015/213758; Ruan L, 2015, ACTA OECON, V65, P87, DOI 10.1556/032.65.2015.S2.7; Schaltegger S., 2011, SOC EC, V33, P15, DOI [DOI 10.1556/SocEc.33.2011.1.4, DOI 10.1556/SOCEC.33.2011.1.4]; Shaik MN, 2014, COMPUT IND ENG, V68, P87, DOI 10.1016/j.cie.2013.12.008; Sharma B, 2011, AUST J PUBL ADMIN, V70, P167, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8500.2011.00718.x; Speckbacher G., 2003, MANAG ACCOUNT RES, V14, P361, DOI [10.1016/j.mar.2003.10.001, DOI 10.1016/J.MAR.2003.10.001]; Tadic J., 2015, ANALI EKONOMSKOG FAK, V51, P111; Tomic S, 2016, ACTA POLYTECH HUNG, V13, P107, DOI 10.12700/APH.13.6.2016.6.6	26	0	0	0	9	ASSOC INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & SCIENCE	NOVI PAZAR	HILMA ROZAJCA 15, NOVI PAZAR, 36300, SERBIA	2217-8309	2217-8333		TEM J	TEM J.

J	Tsur, Y				Tsur, Yacov			Bounding reasonable doubt: implications for plea bargaining	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Reasonable doubt; Conviction threshold; Plea bargaining; Perfect Bayesian equilibrium	ECONOMIC-APPROACH; BAYESIAN EQUILIBRIUM; PLAYERS; CRIME; GAMES; PROOF; LAW	A bound for reasonable doubt is offered based on the cost of type I and type II errors. The bound increases with the punishment, hence its use as a conviction threshold may leave too many offenders of severe crimes at large. Plea bargaining addresses this limitation but introduces strategic interaction between concerned parties. Considering strategic interaction between defendants and judge/jury, it is shown that to any plea offer there corresponds a unique equilibrium. Moreover, all equilibria share the same conviction threshold, given by the reasonable doubt bound. The latter property ensures that the plea bargaining procedure is consistent with the 'equality before the law' principle. The former property (that to any plea offer there corresponds a unique equilibrium) bears implications for the design of plea bargain schemes.

Ethical perceptions of employees in small retailing firms: A case of indigenous-owned fast-food outlets in Zimbabwe	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES			English	Article							SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; BUSINESS ETHICS; PERSPECTIVES; SATISFACTION; CSR; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; PERFORMANCE; STANDARDS; FRAMEWORK; BEHAVIOR	Background: Although the subject of ethical business practices has a well-established tradition in large corporations where shareholder value maximisation is largely dependent on such entities' conduct of good business ethics, its investigation in small businesses in agile, economically depressed economies such as that of Zimbabwe has targeted business owners and managers but excluded their employees. Given the middleman role that employees of emerging indigenous-owned retail firms play in the distribution chain from manufacturers to the consumers, the ethical perceptions of these employees are critical to the leveraging of businesses' strategic orientations. Employees are the coal face of the firm, withering intense competition from these firms' rivals and achieving the firms' strategic orientations (profitability, market share, business growth and survival). In order to meet stakeholder expectations simultaneously largely depends on the ethical conduct of such employees. Aim: The overall aim of this study is to contribute to ethical theory and literature by demonstrating how employees' ethical perceptions and behaviour shape the strategic orientations of the business. To achieve this aim, the study sought to: (1) establish the typical ethical dilemmas that employees of these retail firms faced in their daily tasks, (2) assess how they responded to these ethical challenges, (3) ascertain whether demographic factors such as age, level of education, gender and their position in the organisational hierarchy influence their reaction to ethical dilemmas; and (4) determine these employees' overall perceptions of ethical issues within their organisations. Setting: The study was conducted on employees of an indigenous-owned fast-food firm operating in two cities in Zimbabwe. Methods: A survey was conducted on 108 employees working in two cities. A structured questionnaire was developed and administered to the employees. Results: The results suggested that a majority of the respondents were ethically conscious and could make ethical choices. In addition, most respondents deemed the ethical scenarios presented to them as morally wrong, suggesting that the surveyed employees wished to engage in ethical behaviour. However, while the respondents were deemed to be ethically astute in their individual capacities, they seemed to lack an in-depth knowledge of the ethical policies of their organisation. Conclusion: The study concludes that owners and managers of small firms should provide interventions to cascade ethical policy to the lower ranks of the organisation to enhance the ethical perception amongst employees of these firms. The study implication is that an institutional top-down approach is critical to embedding ethical sensitivity into employees without which employees may continue to speculate about the business ethics of their organisation.

This research revisits the issue in the context of Malaysia where employers find it difficult to motivate employees due to corporate culture. Tenets of the motivation theory, stakeholder theory and Business/IT alignment form the theoretical basis for this investigation. Contrary to expectations, Malaysian quality certified firms showed high operational performance, attributed primarily to the qualities of aligned IT systems and business processes driven by high internal motivation of IT stakeholders. Business stakeholders had high external motivation focused on exploitation of the ISO logo, which had insignificant impact on operational performance but had significant influence on business performance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

J	Canyon, DV; Burkle, FM; Speare, R				Canyon, Deon V.; Burkle, Frederick M.; Speare, Rick			Health Security in Hawaii by 2050: The Physical Effects of Climate Change	JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						climate change; disaster risk reduction; Hawaii; health security; preparedness	HEAT-RELATED MORTALITY; PUBLIC-HEALTH; UNITED-STATES; GLOBAL CLIMATE; CASE-CROSSOVER; VOLCANIC ASH; IMPACTS; TEMPERATURE; EVENTS; DUST	The World Health Organization defined climate change as the most important issue for the 21st century. In 2014, the State of Hawaii called climate change "a matter of security" that directly threatens " economic systems-food, water, energy, biodiversity and health" and has called for " actionable information for local decision making." According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the burden of human morbidity attributable to climate change is relatively small although not well quantified. Nevertheless, generic climate change impacts are often used to justify actions without adequate supporting local evidence. This paper analyzes Hawaii's health risks in relation to air pollution, heat extremes, ultraviolet radiation, and weather extremes and finds that Hawaii's natural geography, robust water, and sanitation infrastructure render the islands less vulnerable to many of the often-mentioned climate change threats. It concludes that the health security threat posed by climate change effects on Hawaii's physical environment over the next 35 years is slight in most areas and moderate with regard to ecosystem health. Because all global communities tend to be both discrete and unique in their vulnerability, it recommends the collection of grassroots, community-based resilience data to reveal local vulnerabilities that can inform strategic statewide planning.

J	Khalid, KM; Wei, JLS				Khalid, Khadijah Md; Wei, Jason Loh Seong			THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES IN BILATERAL COOPERATION DURING THE MAHATHIR AND ABDULLAH YEARS	JEBAT-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY POLITICS AND STRATEGIC STUDIES			English	Article						Mahathir Mohamad; Abdullah Badawi; Southern Provinces; Bilateral Cooperation; Autonomy	THAILAND DEEP SOUTH	Malaysia's relations with Thailand can be described as paradoxical. On the one hand, bilateral ties had been the least 'problematic.' On the other, the situation in the Southern Provinces had constrained relations and this could be seen during the administrations of Mahathir and Abdullah which became preoccupied with finding solutions. In 'aggregating' these two polar states together (`superposition'), one could construe or amplify bilateral relations within a broader range of so-called overall 'benign neglect' that to a certain extent -characterised the approach of successive administrations of both countries. The objective of this paper as conditioned by archival sources as well as interviews seeks, therefore, to highlight the under-appreciated and overlooked role of the leadership factor in bilateral relations. This is in turn co-related to developments in political contestations and reconfigurations centred in Bangkok ("national politics") which whilst promising little hope on the resolution for peace and stability in the Southern Provinces contributes to the (unchanging) broader narrative. In short, directions in bilateral relations have been - to a critical extent - determined, influenced and constrained by the inability to achieve a breakthrough to the situation in the Southern Provinces.

Some hospitals have already invested substantially in real-time location system (RTLS) technology, a specific type of Internet of Things (IoT) application for indoor positioning, to manage mobile clinical devices. Objective: This paper investigates the reuse of RTLS systems to monitor patients and their assigned devices and to manage their connectivity automatically, in real time. Method: A system called Real-time Patient-Device Association and Disassociation (RPDAD) is designed, implemented, and tested in a hospital room and in a university laboratory. Results: RPDAD helps manage patient-device associations through a tablet application, with accurate suggestions for closest devices and automated detection of unexpected disassociations, resulting in real-time alerts. Conclusion: RPDAD offers a usable means of managing associations that does not depend on bar-coding technologies. It also helps amortize investments in RTLS.

J	Ahmad, B; Adnan, G				Ahmad, Basheer; Adnan, Gazanfar			Strategic Alignment between Competitive Strategy Dimensions and Supply Chain Strategy Dimensions	FWU JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES			English	Article						competitive strategy; supply chain strategy; strategic alliances; business performance; supply chainperformance; wireless technology	FIT; INTEGRATION	Pakistani service sector is growing rapidly, however there is a scarcity of empirical investigation related to supply chain issues in wireless internet services in Pakistan. This Study provides a strategic perspective for devising the supply chain strategies (SCS), in coordination to the competitive strategies (CS), targeting the desired performance objectives. The strategic fit/alignment between CS and SCS in Pakistani wireless internet industry was explored and the influence of these alignments on the performance was investigated. An adapted survey questionnaire was used and 77 respondents from 8 companies in Pakistan participated in the survey. General Linear Regression Model (GLM) was used to extract and interpret results. Major findings show high correlations between competitive and supply chain strategies alignments. It is also found that choice of combination between CS and SCS affects business and supply chain performance. Implementation of supply chain management (SCM) practices in Pakistani wireless industry are mainly stalled by "Traditional Practices" (mostly ranked top), "Leadership", (drops the organizational performance) and "Time Constraint", "Low Budget & Expenditure", and "Resources" (boost the organizational performance). A convenient sampling technique is used to collect the information through the adapted questionnaire. Supply chain managers can opt the best combination of CS and SCS dimensions in the presence of hurdles; he/she is facing before implementation of new business strategy to improve the organizational performance. Identification of the best alignment of CS and SCS dimensions is expected to lead the organization towards a productive within organizational culture that ultimately leads to better organizational performance.

J	Canales, JI; Caldart, A				Canales, J. Ignacio; Caldart, Adrian			Encouraging emergence of cross-business strategic initiatives	EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Corporate strategy; Multi-business corporations; Autonomous initiatives; Cross business strategic initiatives	CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT CONTROL; M-FORM; PERFORMANCE; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; INTEGRATION; DELIBERATE; DIVERSITY; INDUSTRY; LINKAGE	We explore how strategic initiatives emerge at the business unit level in the context of multi-business firms. Findings show that such initiatives create cross-business synergies in the absence of any direct intervention from the headquarters. Four factors appeared to foster the development of autonomous cross-business collaboration: a sense of urgency at the level of the firm, the existence of a few broad but strong corporate strategic guidelines, the existence of a set of cross-business integration mechanisms, and an organizational culture promoting collaboration. Our findings suggest that, in addition to developing and enforcing top-down cross-business initiatives, headquarters would benefit from acknowledging the importance of business units' local knowledge by creating an organizational environment characterized by the four conditions identified in this paper.

J	Degato, DD				Degato, Demissie Damite			INNOVATION AND PATHS TO SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY	RISUS-JOURNAL ON INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Innovation; qualitative comparative analysis; sustainability; Fuzzy assessment	GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORK	The traditional approach to innovation assessment has mainly focused on the economic outcomes and failed to capture the ecological and social dimensions of sustainability. By giving high attention to the role of specific kind of innovation (technological innovation), there is little empirical work on whether combining different kinds of innovation leads to progress in social-ecological sustainability in developing countries. The sustainability orientation in the assessment of innovation performance becomes increasingly important for achieve successful transformation towards sustainability. The research question of this study is under what condition or combination of conditions the intervention for innovation reconciles the trade-offs between socioeconomic and ecological performance and thus improve progress towards sustainability in poor countries. Combing concepts and methods from literature on strategic corporate social responsibility (CSR), value chain upgrading, sustainability, and technological capability, this study identifies different mechanisms and conditions for building innovation capacity and then empirically evaluates the relationship between the degree of innovation capacity and the progress towards social-ecological sustainability by taking four cases from Ethiopia. The data for this study is collected using key informant interviews, focus group discussion, and biodiversity and innovation scorecard questionnaire. Mixed methods combing comprehensive fuzzy evaluation, biodiversity scorecard and qualitative comparative analysis are used for analysis. The study found that combing value chain innovation and green governance innovation either with technological upgrading or innovation platform learning are sufficient conditions for achieving social-ecological sustainability. We also found that innovation in green governance and in value chain are necessary conditions for sustainability. By developing and applying fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model for measuring innovation capacity and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis for identifying necessary and sufficient conditions for sustainability, this study made an important methodological contribution to existing literature.

J	Emrick, C; Khorana, A; Shivdasani, A; Ventouras, P				Emrick, Craig; Khorana, Ajay; Shivdasani, Anil; Ventouras, Peter			The Keys to Success in Spinoffs	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CORPORATE FINANCE			English	Article								Corporate restructurings accomplished through spinoffs have long been a key tool for management to unlock shareholdervalue. In 2016, global spinoff volume reached $117 billion, and spinoff activity continues to unfold at a similar pace in 2017, with Hilton, Xerox, Alcoa, Johnson Controls, and Danaher all recently completing major transactions. Spinoffs are often designed to increase strategic focus and discipline in the allocation of capital, enabling companies to respond more effectively to opportunities that create shareholder value, including transformational M&A. And intensifying shareholder activist pressure, along with favorable debt market conditions, has provided significant momentum to spinoff activity. In fact, almost 20% of the companies that announced spinoffs in the past five years were subject to some form of prior activist engagement. Moreover, part of the impetus for such activism can be traced to the record M&A volume of the past few years, which has added to investor demand for many acquisitive companies to consider shedding businesses that are no longer a strategic fit. But even with all this M&A activity, opportunities for unlocking value through spinoffs have not been as abundant or readily identified as in the past owing to the general reduction in corporate business diversification that has taken place during the last decade or so. And perhaps reflecting this development, the average longer-run shareholder returns from spinoffs have actually turned negative during the past five years, while the dispersion of spinoff returns has increased, representing greater downside risk for restructurings undertaken without an effective strategy and rationale for increasing efficiency and value. Nonetheless, more than half of all spinoffs over the past five years have generated share price outperformance despite the overall decline in spinoff performance. The authors devote the second half of the article to identifying several key characteristics of the post-separation entities that indicate the potential for such a restructuring to deliver share price outperformance. The main attributes of value-increasing spinoffs are size and organic growth, and increases in business focus and capital efficiency; but such transactions have also produced companies that maintain the financial flexibility to pursue M&A along with a dividend policy that is both attractive and sustainable.

Exploring the impact of firm- and relationship-specific factors on alliance performance: Evidence from Turkey	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							STRATEGIC ALLIANCE; PARTNER SELECTION; SUCCESS FACTORS; TRUST; RESOURCE; CAPABILITIES; COOPERATION; MANAGEMENT; COMPLEMENTARITY; ORIENTATION	This study investigates the impact of firm-specific (i.e., alliance orientation and partner selection criteria) and relationship specific (i.e., strategic fit, cultural fit, and organizational fit) factors on alliance performance and assesses the mediating role of trust in the relationship between relationship-specific factors and alliance performance. Partial least squares analysis is applied to a data set of 106 strategic alliances, including both equity alliances (joint ventures) and non-equity alliances (contractual alliances). The empirical results reveal that alliance orientation and strategic fit lead to superior alliance performance and that cultural fit is positively related to partner trustworthiness. The results have managerial implications regarding how to maximize the positive outcomes of an alliance.

J	Ho, JKY; Lee, Q; Lam, JCH; Tang, KS				Ho, Jasperine Ka Yee; Lee, Quinnie; Lam, Jaden Chun Ho; Tang, Kam Shing			Managing serious clinical deterioration in a tertiary hospital in Hong Kong: from indicators development to multiple measures in reducing the rates	JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article						benchmarking; clinical governance; patient care	MEDICAL EMERGENCY TEAM; CARDIAC ARRESTS; NEW-ZEALAND; MORTALITY; CARE; CARDIOPULMONARY; IMPLEMENTATION; ANTECEDENTS; IMPROVEMENT	Rationale, aims and objectives Timely detection and management of acutely deteriorating patients can save lives. Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH), a 1800-bed acute tertiary hospital serving more than 1.06 million populations in Hong Kong, is exploring to quantitatively monitor serious clinical deterioration (SCD) and uses it to guide patient care improvement initiatives. Methods Literature review on definition and measurement of SCD was conducted. Monthly SCD rates of TMH were first calculated according to the published methodology and benchmarked against those of international centres. A refined composite clinical indicator good for local use was compiled. In the second phase, p-control charts of SCD have been plotted based on cumulative data. Results TMH's performance was comparable with that of international centres. SCD on p-control charts has been plotting since January 2013. There were peaks in all 4 SCD rates during the winter surge period in 2013-2014. In the third phase, multiple measures have been taking to reduce the SCD rates including targeting the 3 main factors of winter surge situation. We are delighted to observe that the pattern did not repeat in the rate of cardiac arrest without do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DNACPR) and rate of death without DNACPR in the same period in 2014-2015. Conclusions SCD becomes a clinical governance tool to monitor the performance of clinical teams in treating acutely deteriorating patients in TMH.

Koufu: Fortune of an Entrepreneurial Singapore Hawker	ASIAN CASE RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article								This case traces the rags-to-riches entrepreneurial journey of Mr Pang Lim in building his Koufu food court business empire over the past decades amidst the changing landscape of the food and beverages industry in Singapore. After dropping out of school at 13 years old, Mr Pang started work as a dishwasher in the 1960s. However, his entrepreneurial acumen enabled him to seize strategic opportunities and adapt to changing environmental forces to become the owner of Koufu, a leading food court chain in Singapore. When Koufu was founded in 2002, the food court business in Singapore was already dominated by other major players such as Food Junction and Kopitiam. Yet, through astute management, clearly defined market segmentation strategies, and a significant focus in brand-building, Koufu grew into an international food court empire. By 2012, it consisted of 54 food courts in Singapore, one food court in Macau, and annual revenue of $152.7 million. Koufu also grew to become one of Singapore's most established F&B brands with many sub-brands in its stable. This case is suitable for use in Marketing Strategy and Strategic Marketing courses. Key marketing and branding theories and concepts illustrated in this case include macro-environment and micro-environment analysis; segmentation, targeting and positioning strategies; and branding architectures (i.e., house of brands, branded house, house brand).

Self Help Group: A Strategic Tool for Women Empowerment	PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES			English	Article						Empowerment; Self Help Groups; women	INDIA	In a patriarchal society, like India, women live a very underprivileged life. In order to improve the condition of women, the government of India has adopted the strategy of Self Help Groups(SHGs). In this study, an attempt is made to analyse the role SHGs play in the empowerment of Indian women. The SHG is the association of 15-20 members of the same socioeconomic background working collectively to solve problems on the principle of self-help, harmony and mutual coordination. In this study research was conducted on 125 respondents from SHG group and Non-SHG group to facilitate comparison. The results indicate that SHG strategy helps in the empowerment of women.

J	Pathak, AA; Singhal, M				Pathak, Atul Arun; Singhal, Manish			Fiamchi: Fishing in Troubled Waters	ASIAN CASE RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article								Abhijeet, Amit, Alok and Saumitra met recently while attending a six-month residential course on entrepreneurship at a leading management institute in eastern India and decided to start a business venture together. They formed a partnership firm named Fiamchi, and explored the opportunity of producing the Pangasius breed of catfish in either open tanks or using the cage farming method. The opportunity looked attractive. There was good demand for fish locally. Also, technical and financial support was available through various government schemes. The cost-structure was such that their venture had a good chance of making profits. However, social issues peculiar to Jharkhand state, the region where they were planning to start their venture, made their decision to go ahead a tough one. A largely uneducated, poverty stricken, nature worshiping, tribal population lived in the area. There was a possibility that the local population would oppose the project due to their social and religious beliefs. Also, the region was affected by Naxalite violence. The entrepreneurs were concerned about the impact that the social unrest and violence would have on their venture. More importantly, they were also worried that the local population would initially allow them to commence their business but cause a "hold-up" at a later stage when the investments were already made. For a business dealing in the production of a rather fragile and perishable product, this sort of a 'hold-up' would have serious negative implications and lead to large losses. The case discusses four strategic alternatives that the entrepreneurs need to evaluate. They can either buy peace; collaborate in government projects in the region; approach local population through a not-for-profit or non-governmental organization; or seek corporate support through the corporate social responsibility activities of a large company active in the region.

J	Pruszkowski, T				Pruszkowski, Tomasz			Deficiency Judgments as a Mortgage Pricing Factor	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						deficiency judgment; recourse and non-recourse mortgages; mortgage pricing policies		The subject of the deficiency judgments has been poorly examined due to a lack of relevant data and the complexity of the issue. Some comprehensive studies have explored whether allowing deficiency judgments decreases the likelihood of strategic defaults in the U.S. mortgage market. Little, however, has been done to determine whether there is any direct correlation between legal standing allowing recourse and loan pricing. Hence, additional work regarding this subject is needed. This study seeks to fill this gap by exploring the impact of allowing deficiency judgments on mortgage pricing policy in various U.S. states. Seven distinctive mortgage types in two groups of states were compared. We conclude that there is no statistically significant difference between recourse and non-recourse states in terms of mortgage pricing, regardless of mortgage type.

The development of a speed monitoring system with a long term effect on the progress of road safety, makes it necessary to identify its strategic goals, main functions and system components. The strategy should investigate current speed management methods, regulation framework of road signs, tendencies represented by statistics, enforcement campaigns, control equipment, and last but not least the penalty system. Assessment of the applied speed enforcement practices and framework should involve the revision of the recently operating institutional, legal and technical framework of speed enforcement structure.

J	Yamamoto, T; Takaya, S; Miyagawa, T				Yamamoto, Takashi; Takaya, Satoshi; Miyagawa, Toyo			Influence of Corrosion Distribution on Estimation of Flexural Loading Capacity of Corroded RC Beams	JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH			English	Article						reinforcing steel corrosion; distribution of corrosion; flexural loading capacity; Kriging interpolation method; corrosion crack width		A load carrying capacity of the reinforced concrete (RC) member is degraded by the corrosion of reinforcing steel bars due to chloride ion ingress. A lot of researches on the effect of corrosion in the longitudinal tensile reinforcing steel bars on the load carrying behavior have been available up to now. Accurate and quantitative estimation of capacity, however, is often difficult, because of the non-uniformity of corrosion in the member. Thus, a relationship between the spatial distribution of corrosion in the reinforcement including its scatter and the flexural loading capacity of RC member with such distribution of corrosion should be clarified so that the flexural capacity of corroded RC member can be estimated accurately. On the other hand, in case of the practical RC member under the corrosive environment, it should be considered that the flexural capacity often have to be derived from not a large number of inspection data on cross sectional areas of corroded reinforcements. So, in this study, a flexural loading test was performed by using RC beam specimens with the corroded tensile reinforcements provided the distribution of sectional areas. An estimation method of the flexural capacity of corroded RC beam was also shown, considering the distribution and its scatter in sectional areas of corroded reinforcements under the limited inspection data. Furthermore, the estimation of the longitudinal distribution of the cross sectional area of corroded reinforcement was performed by the spatial interpolation using Kriging method. Test results showed the yield and maximum load capacity in the corroded RC beam decreased as the corrosion rate increased. The failure mode of rupture in the reinforcement was shown in the large corrosion. The proposed estimation method was able to lead the safe evaluation of those experimental flexural capacities, determining the appropriate longitudinal characteristic value of the cross sectional area of corroded reinforcement. The flexural capacity can be also safely calculated using the characteristic value of diameters estimated by the corrosion crack width on the surface of the concrete, while the ratio of the experimental flexural capacity to the estimated one decreased as the corrosion loss increased. The distribution of bar diameters in the corroded reinforcement was able to be roughly estimated by using Kriging method.

J	Mallaby, SJ; Price, G; Hofmeyr, K				Mallaby, Stephen J.; Price, Gavin; Hofmeyr, Karl			The transition to general management in South Africa	SA JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article							LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT; IDENTITY	Orientation: Understanding the nature and challenges of making the transition from a functional role to a general management role in South African organisations. Research purpose: The objective of this study was to gain insight into the obstacles that affect the transition from functional to general management and identify steps that may be taken to overcome these challenges. Motivation for the study: One of the most difficult crossroads for a manager is making the shift from being a functional specialist to becoming a general manager. New competencies and behaviours are required, as well as a more strategic mind set. If the transition is not made successfully, the manager and the organisation suffer. Research design, approach and method: A qualitative design was used consisting of in-depth, semi-structured interviews, with 19 senior business leaders who had successfully made the transition. The interviews were used to gather insights into the challenges they faced during their transitions, and how these were overcome. Main findings: To make the transition successfully, functional managers need to gain relevant experience to prepare them for the broader scope of a general management role. They need to develop appropriate skills, attitudes and personal characteristics. Mentoring is an effective development process. Newly appointed general managers need to learn to let go of control while maintaining ownership, build relationships and strike the right balance between strategic thinking and execution. There are unique aspects of being a general manager in South Africa, such as dealing with Black Economic Empowerment and challenges of race and identity, given the country's history. Practical and managerial implications: Specific interventions are suggested which are directed at both aspiring general managers and organisations seeking to assist middle managers to make the transition to general managers. Contribution: This study contributes to knowledge concerning the skills and attributes required by potential general managers, and the practical steps to be taken by South African organisations to facilitate the development of general managers.

Within the scope of the study, data has been collected via survey method from 165 line managers who are working in ten hotel establishments located in Antalya. The data obtained from line managers has been examined by the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, correlation and hierarchical regression analysis. Based on the findings, it is observed that organic organizational structure has positive and significant effect on line managers (leadership, policy implementation and coaching) management styles and it is found that mechanic organizational structure has positive and significant effect on line managers (policy implementation and coaching) management styles. However, it is observed that human resource department strategic roles have a positive and significant effect on line managers' management styles. Moreover, it is found that human resource department strategic roles have a partial mediating effect in the relationships between organic organizational structure and line managers' managements styles, whereas human resource department strategic roles have a full mediating effect in the relationships between mechanic organizational structure and line managers' managements styles.

The research was quantitative and a non-probabilistic survey was performed with 60 TBI EBTs operating in technology parks in the southeastern region of Brazil. The results showed that the investigated ICT EBTs assumed born globals characteristics, since (a) they presented accelerated internationalization for the commercialization, development and customization of products; (B) a relevant fraction of total sales came from commercial activities carried out abroad; (C) have adopted more flexible and active forms of entry into the international market to enhance innovation, such as strategic alliances and licensing; And (d) coordinated the activities of the value chain between different countries.

J	Weko, C; Zhao, YP				Weko, Charles; Zhao, Yunpeng			Penalized component hub models	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Social network analysis; Regularization method; Finite mixture model; Hub model	STOCHASTIC BLOCKMODELS; PREDICTION; ASSOCIATION; REGRESSION	Social network analysis presupposes that observed social behavior is influenced by an unobserved network. Traditional approaches to inferring the latent network use pairwise descriptive statistics that rely on a variety of measures of co-occurrence. While these techniques have proven useful in a wide range of applications, the literature does not describe the generating mechanism of the observed data from the network. In a previous article, the authors presented a technique which used a finite mixture model as the connection between the unobserved network and the observed social behavior. This model assumed that each group was the result of a star graph on a subset of the population. Thus, each group was the result of a leader who selected members of the population to be in the group. They called these hub models. This approach treats the network values as parameters of a model. However, this leads to a general challenge in estimating parameters which must be addressed. For small datasets there can be far more parameters to estimate than there are observations. Under these conditions, the estimated network can be unstable. In this article, we propose a solution which penalizes the number of nodes which can exert a leadership role. We implement this as a pseudo-Expectation Maximization algorithm. We demonstrate this technique through a series of simulations which show that when the number of leaders is sparse, parameter estimation is improved.

J	Diedericks, M				Diedericks, Melvin			Challenges in reporting on predetermined objectives to the Auditor-General: The case of Limpopo provincial departments	TD-THE JOURNAL FOR TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IN SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article								Limpopo provincial departments like all other South African government departments are required to report on performance against predetermined objectives in terms of Section 40 of the Public Finance Management Act 1 of 1999, read in conjunction with Section 5.1.1 of the Treasury Regulations. The purpose of this article is to report on a study that was undertaken to establish the challenges faced by the Limpopo provincial departments in reporting on performance against predetermined objectives to the Auditor-General (AG). Reporting on predetermined objectives has been a challenge over the past financial years and this is evident in the AG's reports, in which Limpopo provincial departments continued to receive qualified audit reports. The literature review carried out for purposes of this study revealed that performance management is fundamental to enhancing organisational performance. A qualitative research design was used to collect and analyse data. Key findings of the study included that management should prioritise strategic planning, performance reporting, monitoring and evaluation to enable it to be in a position to make a determination as to whether what was planned by the department was actually realised. It is also of paramount importance that performance reporting is highly prioritised at strategic, tactical and operational management meetings to ensure more effective and efficient organisational performance.

The main purpose of this paper is to establish a theoretical model through the literature review, that should consider the relationship between the transformational leadership among company staff (Avolio, Bass and Jung, 1999) and the empowerment of the rest of employees (Thomas and Velthouse, 1990 Spritzer, 1995) upon the achievement of an increased capacity for organizational learning in the implementation of the BSC in companies (Easterby-Smith & Araujo,1999) from the following perspectives: financial, customer, business process, learning and growth in major companies in the hotel sector, specifically in four and five-star hotels. The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is a strategic management model (Norton & Kaplan, 1992) that allows the measurement and control of the tangible and intangible objectives based on the company's mission and vision statements. The implementation of BSC has a great influence on the predisposition, training and motivation in middle as well as executive management through empowerment and leadership, hence the importance of the analysis of these variables by means of the BSC.

The objective of this paper is to identify positive and negative aspects involved in realization of SP, PE and PM in HEI, through a literature review in online data bases, which allowed to conduct an exploratory and descriptive study. It was seen that HEI are considered complex systems in which results has implications on SP, PE and PM execution. During the literature review process, some barriers have been identified for its implementation, such as decentralization, departments autonomy, heterogeneity in the departments operation, data stored in places that cannot be accessed by everybody, bureaucracy, change resistance, dissociation between planning and management, as participation lack of university community in planning process. However, there were also found ways to overcome these barriers using mainly the organizational commitment among high management, clear strategy, wide communication and also through the participation of all stakeholders.

THE EFFECTS OF DEVELOPMENT CONSTRAINTS ON FOREST MANAGEMENT AT THE URBAN-FOREST INTERFACE	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Development moratorium; forest management practices; minimum lot size; open space conservation; urban growth	PUBLIC OPEN SPACE; LAND-USE; POPULATION-GROWTH; HOUSING GROWTH; UNITED-STATES; ROTATION; PRIVATE; TIMBER; POLICIES; TAXATION	This article develops a model of a forest owner operating in a small, open-city environment where the rent for developed land is increasing concave in nearby preserved open space and is rising over time, reflecting an upward trend in households' income. Within this framework we examine how changes in nearby preserved open space and alternative development constraints affect an individual private landowner's decisions regarding both regeneration harvests and conversion dates. We also examine how such policies affect development density once conversion from forestry to residential use occurs. We show that when residential rents change over time, the nature of the timber problem at the urban-forest interface changes because it forces us to allow for the possibility of changes in land use from timber to residential use. As a result, the traditional Faustmann setup is not suitable to study forest management decisions at this interface. We also find that in the presence of rising income, increases in permanently preserved open space hasten regeneration and conversion cuts of a neighboring parcel currently under forest use and leads to lower density development once conversion takes place compared to the case where income is constant. We also find that both a binding development moratorium and a binding minimum-lot-size policy can postpone regeneration and conversion cut dates and thus help to protect open space, even if only temporarily. However, the policies do not have the same effects on development density of converted forestland. While the former leads to high-density development, the latter encourages low-density development.

Organizational performance and management constraints of sheep and wool producers' co-operatives in Karnataka	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Co-operatives; Constraint quotient; Performance; Sheep and wool producers		Co-operatives are democratic institution which brings together people across all section of the society having common economic and social interests. However, majority of the co-operatives failed to perform their basic roles and look towards government patronage. The present study was undertaken to examine the issues of performance and constraints of primary sheep and wool producers' co-operatives in the state of Karnataka. A sample of 50 randomly selected primary sheep co-operatives was studied in the Mysuru and Bengaluru region of Karnataka. The results revealed that sheep co-operatives were poor performers in providing service to members, cooperative production and market linkages. However, their performance was moderate in the domains of planning and administrative procedures, human resource management, financial management and membership strategies. Overall performance of the co-operatives although average but was more close towards red line of poor performance. Sheep co-operatives performance was constrained by so many endogenous as well as exogenous factors viz. lack of resource, poor market participation, lack of income, poor management, lack of communication etc. Thus these primary co-operatives have failed to perform effectively which was evident from the findings of the study. In order to make them function as viable and sustainable institutions, these co-operatives need to concentrate their energy to increase their market presence in near future and in long run they can also federate at the state level which provides them strategic advantage in mobilizing resources using this statewide network for the wellbeing of their members and larger community.

J	Mazzeo, G				Mazzeo, Giuseppe			PLANNING ASSIGNMENTS OF THE ITALIAN METROPOLITAN CITIES. EARLY TRENDS	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Metropolitan city; Strategic planning; Territorial planning		The last stage of the process of establishment of the Italian Metropolitan Cities, which took place in 2014, follows of a few decades the start of this institutional reform. In 1990, in fact, the Act 142 (Local Autonomies Reform) had planned metropolitan areas as the administrative organization more suitable to provide these territories of structures for the management and the strategic development alike the best international models. The paper proposes to analyse the first activities taken by the Italian Metropolitan Cities in the sector of territorial government, three years after the enactment in 2014 of Act nr. 56. Focal point of the analysis is the jurisdiction in the formation of two plans (the Strategic Plan and the Metropolitan Territorial Plan) and the following relationships among them, in the logical assumption that between them a necessary and strict consistency there should be. In the first part, the paper analyses some factors characterizing the metropolitan areas and the functions that the law assigns to the new institution in the territorial government sector. The second part outlines the updated situation with regard to the formation of the sectoral tools (Strategic Plan, Territorial Plan and homogeneous zones). The third part analyses the progresses in three Metropolitan Cities taken as sample (Milan, Genoa and Bologna) and, in general, to those of Southern Italy. In the last part, the paper exposes some considerations regarding the issues raised in the article, particularly about the innovativeness of the tools and the timeline for the implementation of the act.

J	Poblet, M; Fitzpatrick, M; Chhetri, P				Poblet, Marta; Fitzpatrick, Mari; Chhetri, Prem			Microtasking: redefining crowdsourcing practices in emergency management	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper examines the roles, types and forms of virtual microtasking for emergency information management in order to better understand collective intelligence mechanisms and the potential for logistics response. Using three case studies this paper reviews the emerging body of knowledge in microtasking practices in emergency management to demonstrate how crowd-sourced information is captured and processed during emergency events to provide critical intelligence throughout the emergency cycle. It also considers the impact of virtual information collection, collation and management on traditional humanitarian operations and relief efforts. Based on the case studies the emergent forms of microtasking for emergency information management were identified. Opportunities for continuities, adaptations and innovations are explained. The contribution of virtual microtasking extends to all supply chain strategic domains to help maximise resource use and optimise service delivery response.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			6th International Conference on Life Cycle Assessment in Latin America-CILCA 2015, Lima, Peru, July 13-16, 2015 Abstracts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT			English	Article								A Brazilian agrochemical company agreed to conduct an initiative to further evaluate the environmental impact caused by its product SC50. This agrochemical is obtained from thiophanate-methyl, an active ingredient produced in Brazil as well as in Japan, where another industrial plant of the same corporation is located. The initiative evaluated the environmental performance of the SC50 life cycle so as to provide the company's private management with information to influence stakeholders in the sector. The working method comprised five steps. Step 1 established the impact profile associated to the SC50 life cycle. The diagnosis was obtained by LCA from a 'cradle-to-grave' approach. Step 2 identified the stages causing significant environmental impacts throughout the entire life cycle. In Step 3, improvement actions were proposed in order to mitigate, reduce, or even minimize the effects detected. Step 4 comprised the modeling, in which specific scenarios and their environmental impacts were analyzed. The synergistic effect was checked by successive additions of improvement actions, characterizing each scenario. Step 5 analyzed the results, comparing impact profiles of each scenario with the original diagnosis (as a baseline scenario) and verifying the individual effect of each action. The results indicate relevant contributions of the dispersion from the SC50 life cycle in terms of global warming, terrestrial ecotoxicity, human toxicity, and eutrophication. Regarding to the manufacture, the use of diesel has great influence in the impacts of SC50, and its performance as eutrophication is conditioned to the low efficiency of the wastewater treatment. While the company decided not to implement improvements in the dispersion stage fearing market losses, five alternatives based on cleaner production principles were proposed to improve performance: to review the instrumentation systems in the plant, to adjust wastewater treatment, to stop importing thiophanate-methyl from Japan, to install an energy cogeneration system, and to substitute renewable glycerin with a fossil counterpart. All scenarios led to improvements from baseline. The use of LCA determined the impact profile associated to SC50 in soybean pest control. Because of strategic reasons, the company decided not to propose improvements in the most significant stage of this life cycle. Among the improvements, we highlight the replacement of imported thiophanate-methyl by a Brazilian equivalent and the installation of a combined cycle for energy recovery. For both these cases, however, the appropriate organizational measures must be taken before implementation.										0	0	0	0	7	SPRINGER HEIDELBERG	HEIDELBERG	TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY	0948-3349	1614-7502		INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS	Int.

Study Results	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION-CENTRAL EUROPE			English	Article						strategic management; strategic information; farm management		Purposes: The main goal of the paper is to determine the significance of selected sources of strategic information, used by Polish farmers in decision making. In addition, an attempt was made to determine the factors impacting the evaluation of those sources among the traits of the farmer and his farm. Methodology: Data was gathered using the questionnaire method and analysed with standard tools of descriptive statistics. Findings: The farmers deemed personalised sources of strategic information the most important, especially agricultural advisers, input suppliers and buyers of agricultural products. From among institutional (non-personalised) sources, local government and the chamber of agriculture were significant. Business information agencies and survey companies are the least important sources for farmers. The characteristics of the surroundings of the farm - specifically, its geographic location and the size of settlement where it is located proved to have the widest impact on the evaluation of the sources included in the study. From among the organisational factors, only farm size has a significant impact. Research limitations/implications: The study was confined to a representative group of farmers in Poland. A closed list of sources of strategic information was used. Originality/value: The study results contribute to the knowledge on the functioning of Polish agriculture and may also be used in comparative studies, characterising this sector's diversity within Europe. They can in turn contribute to properly focusing on supporting the policy of balanced agriculture development in the EU.

J	Jayasuriya, MPF; Cheng, GP				Jayasuriya, M. Prasad F.; Cheng Guoping			FACTORS WHICH STRATEGICALLY EXPLAIN THE COMPETITIVENESS OF A TOURISM DESTINATION: EVIDENCE FROM SINGAPORE AND SRI LANKA	RISUS-JOURNAL ON INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Developed and developing countries; Competitive factors; Position and competitiveness of a tourism destination; Model of strategic evaluation of tourism destination		Globally tourism industry has experienced rapid growth in the last 25 years, a trend predicted to continue in future and as such, the field of tourism has emerged as an area of theoretical and practical interest. Although the competition among countries engaged in tourism has increased, the world travel and tourism competitive index (TTCI) reveals striking disparities among developed and developing countries as tourism destinations. This paper is an attempt to examine the elementary reasons for such disparity through identification of competitive factors which strategically explain the position and competitiveness of a tourism destination. For clarity and better understanding the study was conducted with evidence from Singapore and Sri Lanka. Data collection was carried out adopting a survey instrument with purposive sampling and structured questionnaire to examine fifteen factors illustrating tourism destination competitiveness based on responses received from the two countries - 70 from Singapore and 66 from Sri Lanka. The analyzed data were used in a model of strategic evaluation of tourism destination to diagnose the strengths, weaknesses as well as the competitive opportunities of the two countries through the review of 15 competitive factors. The results strategically explained the competitive positions of both tourism destinations, while findings on factors provided guidelines to achieve greater destination competitiveness. Further, the model of strategic evaluation first tested in Spain for tourism destination competitiveness, was extended for pertinence in other tourism destinations and situations.	[Jayasuriya, M.

For this study, 15 publicly traded U.S. airlines and information on 194 TMTs were used. Panel feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) was selected as the main analytic method. The results show that TMTs' tenure, education, and share ownership play a significant role in airlines' strategic risk-taking decisions. Shareholders and boards of directors can use background information when selecting agents to achieve the desired outcomes. Investors can also use this information to assess the potential risks of airline stocks.

They provide a brief overview of the importance of turnover research in the organizational sciences, highlight the role of performancerelated turnover rates research, and outline general theories and findings that appear in the Western and English-language literature. This evidence is compared with a dearth of studies using samples of Chinese organizations and in Chinese-language journals. They conclude by calling for additional theory and empirical studies on turnover rates.

J	Yousefifar, S; Riahi, A				Yousefifar, Shahram; Riahi, Azam			A Historical Study of Immigration Phenomenon in Undeveloped Societies: Study of Economic Reasons of Immigration during Pahlavi I Period in Zahedan	TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH			English	Article						Immigration; Zahedan; Pahlavi I period; Undeveloped societies		During the reign of Reza Shah, policy of magisterial modernization was done on the basis of society modernization by importing products, civilization manifestations, modern management, monopolizing political power and governmentalizing economy. Social structures, under the influence of integration in global system and the effects caused by two world wars, as a semi-periphery region, did not stay away from unpleasant consequences of the situation such as immigration inside the borders of Iran and immigration among the political borders of Iran especially in eastern borders. Because of special geographical situation (border region) and economic situation (silk trade route), eastern borders had an important role in Iran's exterritorial immigration system and were receptive to resident ethnics in neighbor countries (Hazara in Afghanistan, Sikh, etc.) and were also the entry gate of immigrants to eastern cities of Iran. In this research, emphasizing on Iran's situation in global system, immigration and its causes on Zahedan have been studied. The results suggest that the strategic location of Zahedan was a predisposing factor of preliminary foundations such as railway for economy growth of the city and a small group of Hindus' immigration for employment in this part. Gradually, central government actions in customs section and transportation development, turned Zahedan into a suitable region for trade that resulted immigration and habitation of many citizens of neighboring countries in order to work in economic fields. Because of disability in adaption to new conditions and lack of proficiency, many native inhabitants immigrated to the other regions.

J	Marques, B; Ricardo, M				Marques, Bruno; Ricardo, Manuel			Synchronization of application-driven WSN	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Wireless sensor network (WSN); ContikiRPL; Nodes synchronization; EWMA	MAC PROTOCOL; SENSOR	The growth of wireless sensor networks (WSN) has resulted in part from requirements for connecting sensors and advances in radio technologies. WSN nodes may be required to save energy and therefore wake up and sleep in a synchronized way. In this paper, we propose an application-driven WSN node synchronization mechanism which, by making use of cross-layer information such as application ID and duty cycle, and by using the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) technique, enables nodes to wake up and sleep without losing synchronization. The results obtained confirm that this mechanism maintains the nodes in a mesh network synchronized according to the applications they run, while maintaining a high packet reception ratio.

J	Arunagiri, S; Mathew, M				Arunagiri, Srigowtham; Mathew, Mary			Exploring Technology Evolution Using Patent Classification: A Case of Cochlear Implant Technology Patents	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Technology evolution; patent classifications; cochlear implant technology; network analysis		Understanding technology evolution through periodic landscaping is an important stage of strategic planning in R&D management. In fields like that of healthcare, where initial R&D investment is huge and good medical products serve patients better, activities of periodic landscaping become crucial for planning. Approximately 5% of the world's population has hearing disabilities. Current hearing aid products meet less than 10% of the global needs. Patent data and classifications on cochlear implants from 1977-2010 show the technology evolution in the area of such an implant. We attempt to highlight emergence and disappearance of patent classes over a period of time indicating changes in growth of cochlear implant technologies. Using network analysis technique we explore and capture the technology evolution in patent classes by showing what emerged or disappeared over time. Dominant classes are identified. The sporadic influence of university research in cochlear implants is also discussed.

Data show that within 12 years there has been a decline in forest area in Indonesia amounted to approximately 20 million hectares, or an average of 1.7 million hectares per year. Other data show that between 1990-2010, Indonesia forest area shrank from 118 million hectares to 94 million hectares in 2010, whether caused by changes in the function of forest, forest fires, or unsustainable forest management, with the deforestation rates 450,637.1 ha/year. Sustainale forest management has been known to be effective in absorbing carbon emissions through increased in-growth and productivity of natural forests, and maintain its biodiversity and environmental functions. Currently a decline in production of natural forest area, which is caused by various factors such as a poor investment climate. The research method is based on qualitative research, ie in-depth interviews, Focus Group Discussion (FGD), SWOT Analysis, and Business Model Canvas (BMC). Result of the research shown that: 1) Business Model Canvas date suggests that customers Kaltim forest resources consist of domestic and foreign companies, universities, foreign tourists and domestik. Service to customers who want environmentally friendly wood enhanced by selling certified wood; (2) The results of a SWOT analysis indicates the certainty area (land dispute), the low to the high Law enforcement of illegal logging, not an institutional one door, timber prices are low, holder IUPHHK make messy collapse of the forest industry; (3) The Strategy of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) through BMC improved is the element key partnership in the form of governance of institutional fixed, protecting customary rights, provide incentives for IUPHHK, while the element Key activity in the form of certified HR forestry, and the elements of Customer segement is a green marketing strategy.

J	Abreu Pederzini, GD				Abreu Pederzini, Gerardo David			The senior management sensemaking paradox	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Leadership; Complex adaptive system; Complexity; Senior management; Paradox; Complexity leadership	DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; STRATEGIC CHANGE; ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSE; HOSPITAL REGULATION; COMPLEXITY THEORY; UPPER ECHELONS; LEADERSHIP; SCIENCE; TOP; ROMANCE	Purpose - From a complexity leadership theory perspective, leadership stops being seen as residing in an individual, and come to be conceived as emergent from the myriad interactions among organizational members. However, in spite of this reconceptualization, organizations still have senior managers (e.g. the CEO) who are supposed to be leading, and thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore, then, who are these senior managers and what challenges emerge for them under a complexity leadership perspective. Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews first the literature on complexity theory and leadership, and then, conceptually develops an understanding of the challenges that senior managers might face under complexity. Findings - The main finding and focus of the paper is that, from a complexity perspective, a paradox emerges regarding senior managers. On the one hand, senior managers might need to make sense of their limitations and the unowned essence of the processes that surround them. On the other hand, their subordinates might still insist on portraying senior managers as final causes of all success or failure. Originality/value - This paper presents a novel way to re-conceptualize senior managers, under a complexity perspective, where they come to be perceived as trapped in a paradox of contradictory sensemaking processes: as they come to find out all that is outside of their control their subordinates insist on making them responsible for everything as if they had control.

Resistance of Annual Ryegrass against Acetolactate Synthase-Inhibiting Herbicides in Wheat Fields: Field Evaluation and Molecular Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Annual ryegrass; Base pair substitution; Ecosystem; Herbicide resistance point mutation	LOLIUM-RIGIDUM GAUD.; CROSS-RESISTANCE; WEEDS; IDENTIFICATION; POPULATIONS; SITE	Resistance to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibiting herbicides in annual ryegrass has evolved widely in Saudi Arabia but mutations conferring resistance have never been reported. In survey of 91 fields, representing seven ecological regions in Saudi Arabia four (57%) populations had resistance; whereas two (29%) populations had tendency of resistance development against ALS-inhibition herbicides. Use of ALS-inhibiting herbicides provided up to 73% control of ryegrass. Ten base pair substitution evolved in public sphere by the alignment of ALS cDNA sequence. Phenotypic alteration found in five mutants subsequently induced changes in amino acid. The Pro-197-Thr and Pro-197-Gln in Tabouk and Harad population, respectively present at earlier reported location with novel changes in amino acid threonine was unreported. Novel ALS-allele represented by Lys-98-Met mutants had methionine amino acid observed in whole Saudi population except resistant one with lysine. From Asp-185-Tyr novel allele was identified, aspartic acid in all Saudi population as well as in resistant allele and transformed into tyrosine. There exists resistance in ryegrass against ALS-inhibiting herbicides, which suggests use of alternate herbicides and/or development of integrated weed management strategies for wheat in Saudi Arabia.

Hence, there is a need to proactively address strategic weaknesses in measures directed at protecting the built environment (BE). The purpose of this paper is to examine stakeholders' role in the frameworks on disaster risk reduction (DRR) in the context of fire hazards within Lagos metropolis. Analysis is based on findings of research carried out on vulnerability, resilience assessment and guiding principles from three recent frameworks. Design/methodology/approach - Mixed research design was adopted using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. In all, 165 BE professionals in the construction industry, state/federal emergency management and local/national government agencies were randomly selected. Findings - Findings show that stakeholders believe prevention, preparedness and mitigation of disasters are the most important; however, BE professionals in the construction industry do not play active roles in the mitigation of fire risk despite wide publications on guidance for fire hazard mitigation. These stakeholders urgently need to adopt fire hazard mitigation strategies, especially in the pre-construction phase of a building's life cycle which is identified as the most critical stage in the construction phase. Research limitations/implications - The paper looked at fire occurrence in Lagos from the perspective of the BE with the view to fill knowledge gaps for adopting fire hazard mitigation strategies. Originality/value - The findings brought to bear the need for stakeholders, especially BE professionals in the construction industry, to be better involved in DRR as regards fire occurrences.

Strategic steps for Nigerian hospitality human capital development	WORLD JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Human capital productivity strategies; Improved employee productivity; Tourism; hospitality; and leisure industry; Workplace policies and procedures	QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; PRODUCTIVITY; TOURISM; TECHNOLOGY; INVESTMENT; INDUSTRY; RETURN; COMPENSATION; PERFORMANCE; EDUCATION	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore human capital (HC) productivity strategies used by the tourism, hospitality, and leisure (THL) industry business leaders in Nigeria which improved the employee productivity. Design/methodology/approach - The participants in this research study comprised randomly selected Southern Nigerian business leaders with specialist expertise in the THL industry. Individual interviews were undertaken with participants to gain both an insight and understanding regarding which strategies are best suited to improve employee productivity. A further analysis of workplace policies and procedures provided additional insights related to the application of such workplace practices toward productivity improvements. Findings - The findings of this study identified that recruiting persons with essential social capital, inducting them into high ethical standards, providing in-house training, motivating employees with reward and recognition, and the adoption of affordable technologies are key industry strategies to build a productive employee workforce. Practical implications - Implementing the findings from this study may help develop a new type of THL professionals, especially in the hotel and restaurant sub-sectors that will enhance the attractiveness of the THL industry and encourage patronage. The opportunity to interact with new people in THL businesses and locations may promote social interaction and integration that are invaluable to an ethnically and religiously diverse country such as Nigeria. These benefits are valuable and are essential positive social changes. Originality/value - A structured HCD program might deliver a net benefit to the industry. To the employees, there may be improved remuneration, increased self-esteem, and job security. To the industry, there may be a reduction in employee turnover, improvement in productivity, improved attraction of graduates, and reduced engagement of illegal workers. The government could also experience increased gross domestic product.

J	Arai, K				Arai, Koki			Ex-post examination of mergers: effects on retail prices	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING & ECONOMICS			English	Article						competition policy; expost examination; merger	ECONOMETRICS; INDUSTRY; COMPETITION; GASOLINE; MARKET; CON	Merger control can be assessed simply by observing price movements of the product in question. In this study, three ex-post merger evaluations show statistically significant price increases. Thus, in each case, the change in market power is analyzed in terms of changes in market sales and market share. The analyses indicate that market sales values increased but market share decreased significantly. Although several studies showed the market price situation before and after a merger, this study is the first to analyze the appropriateness of merger control in terms of market sales and market share. In addition, one of the merging parties was likely to reposition its production lines, indicating that mergers and acquisitions may be used as a tool for strategic product differentiation. That is, under such merger regulations, leading examples of a merging party developing a marketing strategy are indicated.

J	Axelsson, R; Axelsson, SB; Gustafsson, J; Seemann, J				Axelsson, Runo; Axelsson, Susanna Bihari; Gustafsson, Jeppe; Seemann, Janne			Great expectations - introduction of flow managers in a university hospital	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						reorganization; patient flows; flow managers		A major reorganization of a university hospital included the clinical structure as well as the administrative structure of the hospital. The focus of the reorganization was to improve the coordination of patient flows through the hospital. An important part of the organizational change was the introduction of flow managers. The aim of the article is to describe and analyze the challenges of the flow managers in the implementation of the reorganization. The description is based on a number of individual and focus group interviews with professionals and managers on different organizational levels. The analysis is guided by a broad conceptual framework, focusing on the processes of change in a professional organization like a hospital. The results show that the flow managers started with a lot of uncertainty regarding their responsibilities. There was also a lot of resistance to the reorganization, which the flow managers came to personify. They proceeded by building relationships and shaping their role and tasks. They tried to balance proactive and reactive strategies of change. There were some positive results, but they felt that that the expectations placed on them had been unrealistic. The introduction of flow managers in a university hospital has touched upon many elements of the conceptual framework. There were a number of structural, cultural, financial and strategic barriers influencing the change process. The main conclusion of the analysis is that the flow managers need more power and legitimacy in the organization to deal with these barriers. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The new "Territorial Authorities of the wide areas" will need to take and actualize the Strategic Metropolitan Plan with a territorial planning looking more closely at infrastructures, coordinated management of the public services, development of mobility and viability systems and structures, coordination of urban planning, promotion of economic and social development, strenghtening the information and digital systems. The Metropolitan City of Bari is a wide area with a strong polycentric weave constituted by 41 municipalities, some of them having a significant dimension, placed around the regional capital and organized in two coronas supplementary to the open spaces of the country side, sometimes compromised with a situation of sprawl and land consumption, due to the tendence of the urban center to join together.

J	Bagorka, M				Bagorka, Mariya			METHODOLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS FOR FORMING THE MARKETING STRATEGY OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION ECOLOGIZATION	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						marketing strategy of ecologization; agrarian production; strategic categories; strategic analysis; marketing researches; ecological-economic mechanism		The purpose of the article is the investigation of the nature, objectives, and strategic categories of ecologization marketing strategy, development of algorithm of this strategy and determination of environmental, economic, and ecological instruments of implementation of this strategy in the agricultural sector. Methodology. The basis of the formation of a marketing strategy for the ecologization of agrarian production is the systematic approach, which is based on the existence of implementation mechanisms that ensure system consistency, its purposefulness; interdependence; and complexity of its elements, which determines the integrity of the system; all tasks that execute individual elements of the system are interconnected; system elements and their associated actions have a certain subordination that builds a hierarchy; the system changes under the influence of specific factors, which determines its dynamism; the ability of the system to adapt to the variability of the external environment, while not losing its own individuality. Methods for strategic analysis of macro- and micro-environment factors were used to form the marketing strategy of ecologization. This process involves an analytical evaluation of the parameters of the external and internal environment with the help of general scientific and applied methods of strategic analysis. Results. The article explored the ecologization strategy, presented its objectives in the field of agriculture, the basic categories of strategic directions and implementation of ecologization marketing strategies. An algorithm of environmental marketing strategies in agricultural production is developed, environmental, economic and environmental and economic tools to implement them are determined. Practical implications. It is determined that marketing strategy of ecologization of agrarian production is a strategy of innovative development that can solve problems of economic growth, an increase of competitiveness of the agrarian industry, provide a high quality of life, national security, environmental protection, and high technical level of agricultural production in Ukraine. Value/originality. This marketing strategy is capable of ensuring the principle of unity for economic and ecological processes in the management of agricultural production and promoting radical restructuring of the relationship of the production process from the environment.

Methodology: There has been used the analytical model SWOT to analyze the findings and to determine the suitable strategy and the network analysis process (ANP) to prioritize the strategies. Also, there have been used the interviews, library, and field studies, previous researches and the comments of the strategic council members included the faculty members and the sports officials of the university in order to gather data and then three questionnaires made by the researcher have been used. Results: In first questionnaire, the effective internal and external factors have been identified. The validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by the experts and its reliability was confirmed by Cronbach's alpha test (0.86). There has been determined the intensity factor and the coefficient of the importance of each item by second questionnaire and strategic sessions. At these stages, due to particularity of the statistical population, the questionnaires have been completed by 20 persons from the faculty members and the sports officials of the university. According to the findings and results of the calculated weight of the super matrix and the opinions of the members of the strategic council, there have been suggested the operational planning including the codification of the regulations and guidelines for public sport tours and championship tours and identification and development and guidance of the sports students in the public classes of the physical education and sports to attend in internal and external competitions.

Learning starts from individuals and ultimately forms the basis of organisational learning. In the present paper, interrelationship of variables related to effective organisational learning has been studied using interpretive structural modelling. The model aims to identify the strategic and performance variables so that their role dominance can be identified. Further these variables have been categorised according to their driving power and dependence.	[Bansal, Mani; Nayyar, Ruchi] NorthCap Univ, Sch Management, Gurgaon 122017, Haryana, India; [Vij, A.

We measure this by building a composite indicator able to monitor over time the contribution of the different manufacturing sectors to the overall economic performance of China. In particular we define the strategic significance of the different manufacturing sectors according to their ability to stimulate entrepreneurship, generate employment, generate capital accumulation, meet market demand, generate profits, and produce fiscal revenues. Results suggest a good and stable contribution of the health-industry filiere to the Chinese economy. They also point to a relevant and increasing contribution of specific sub-sectors, including traditional Chinese medicine and proprietary Chinese medicine.

J	Bereznyakov, DV; Kozlov, SV				Bereznyakov, Dmitry V.; Kozlov, Sergey V.			PROJECTING THE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OF THE EURASIAN ECONOMIC UNION THROUGH THE PRISM OF THE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS' ALLIANCE THEORY	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY			Russian	Article						alliances; EEC; international relations; hegemonic power; strategy of constructive partnership; strategy of coercive partnership		Rapid changes in the structure of international relations in the 21st century have led to the emergence of alternate centers of power claiming a "great power" status. Their strategic behavior on the international stage requires theoretical conceptualization reflective of current transformations in international relations. Drawing on methodologies of the international relations' alliance theory the article seeks to define a possible direction of Russia's strategic behavior as a dominant actor in the EAEU. The alliance theory argues that stable functional alliances in world politics are defined by assymetric statuses of their participants and by the exclusive role of a hegemonic power in providing security. In the course of the emerging post bi-polar structure of international relations hegemonic powers find themselves competing to recruit "minor" alliance members. The stated aim of the article is pursued by applying key principles of the alliance theory to the study of Eurasian integration, by identifying certain key elements of the geopolitical context for the EAEU's expansion and development, and by defining meaningful distinction criteria for the EAEU and the EU as alliances with different historical, economic, and political foundations. When evaluating the strategic context for the formation of the Eurasian Economic Union, which defines actor behavior of the former republics of the Soviet Union, it is necessary to take into account both the evolved role of the United States as a global hegemonic power and the precipitous increase in the geopolitical weight of China as an alternate power center. Furthermore, a major factor shaping the behavior of post-Soviet states is the growing role of Islam which casts doubt on the secular legitimacy of these polities. Institutional weakness of these states as legitimate power monopolies and the ageing of their elites increase uncertainty risks and drive post-Soviet states to seek partners in order to form alliances, which could ensure stability in their macro-region. In this case uncritical borrowing of the experience of European integration could play a negative role since the formation of the European Union and the formation of the Eurasian Economic Union occurred in different historical conditions. The European Union was formed as a union of stable nation states in the bi-polar structure of international relations with the United States assuming the role of the military resource security provider for that alliance. The Eurasian Economic Union, however is made up only of actors with post-Soviet experience of state building whose elites have been mostly shaped in the political and cultural space of the Soviet era. In the course of this research study, the authors came to conclude that stabilizing the post-Soviet space in the EAEU format requires from Russia as an alliance leader to develop a mode of strategic behavior that would create long term planning horizons, both for Russia and for other alliance members. Such strategy could be defined as "constructive partnership", which means at its core that Russia will be assuming main costs of maintaining security and coordinating projects of reindustrialization and reconstitution of a shared economic space.

J	Biswas, M				Biswas, Malay			When not investing in formal R&D, how do they manage innovative capacity? Evidence from Indian manufacturing firms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND LEARNING			English	Article						Indian manufacturing; innovative capacity; strategic choices; in-house R&D; contract R&D; licensing; joint venture	TOP MANAGEMENT; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; UPPER ECHELONS; MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS; DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; JOINT VENTURES; FAMILY FIRMS	Drawing upon multiple theories, our research attempts to examine the role of various organisational characteristics that potentially influence distinct strategic choices for management of innovative capacities of firms. We use data from the World Bank with a sample size of 2,206 Indian manufacturing firms across industries collected from 20 industrial hubs. We examine how various organisational characteristics influence strategic choices and subsequently how these strategic choices affect the innovative capabilities of the firm. Results indicated that organisational characteristics play a significant role in its strategic choice for innovation. Our research contributes to the existing discourse on market entry strategies, technology transfer arrangements, and innovation management. Our research inherits a number of limitations such as omitted variables, selective firm level characteristics, mutually exclusive event that we have highlighted at the end before drawing tentative conclusions.

J	Budzynska, K				Budzynska, Katarzyna			Business process outsourcing sector in Visegrad Group	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND LEARNING			English	Article						outsourcing; business process outsourcing; BPO; offshoring; nearshoring; innovation		More and more companies decide to build their own branch offices or transfer some functions outside of the company and out of the country, where the main office is located. Offshoring is very often a strategic decision for a company. It allows to increase the competitiveness in the market for the company. If offshoring is carried out properly it can considerably contribute to the improvement of the operational efficiency and it enables it to focus on the core business. The use of this management model makes it possible to give an opportunity to use a unique know-how, technology and competencies. The aim of this article is to define the concept of offshoring and to list its advantages and disadvantages. This article gives a brief description of the BPO sector in Visegrad Group. These countries have an opportunity to attract foreign investments from the BPO/SSC sector owing to the cost competitiveness and relatively high quality of human resources. Therefore, the state and the municipal governments should understand in which specialisation they can compete on the offshoring market. They should also emphasise promotion, which would help them compete in Europe.

J	Cherkasov, A; Kolesnyk, I				Cherkasov, Andrii; Kolesnyk, Iryna			THE MECHANISM OF STRATEGIC, POLITICAL AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT OF THE QUALITY OF UNIVERSITY SERVICES	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						higher education; quality management; university management; development; educational services; strategy		The purpose of this work is to justify the need to develop and implement a mechanism for managing the quality of higher education services, which will solve a number of pressing problems that have arisen at the national level, at the level of the higher education system and the level of individual higher education institutions. Methodology. This study is based on the use of ENQA standards and recommendations, as well as modern general methods and practice of quality management. Results.The functioning of the mechanism for managing the quality of higher education services should be considered at three levels of decision-making (three hierarchically subordinate components of the mechanism), which are as follows: strategic, political and process. It is determined that the management of a higher education institution, like any organization, is carried out at three levels of decision-making: strategic, tactical, and operational. The paper substantiated the content and features of the implementation of the functions of each component of the quality management mechanism. Practical implications. The work determined the components of strategic management of the quality of higher education institutions' services, which include: strategic analysis of the external environment and self-assessment of the educational institution, development of strategic plans, management of the implementation of the higher educational institution strategy. Value/originality. It is determined that the political management of the quality of higher education services includes a broad setting of goals of the higher education institution, which in turn is determined by senior management, set forth in written, formally announced (published) and communicated to all staff and units of the higher education institution. The political goals of the education institution regarding quality are structured by functional and administrative management areas.

J	Chillara, LH; Sahoo, D; Ponnam, A				Chillara, Lakshmi Hymavathi; Sahoo, Debajani; Ponnam, Abhilash			Determinants and outcomes of faculty consulting from management teachers' perspective	JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Management consulting; Academic consulting; Determinants of academic consulting	ENGAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; SCHOLARSHIP; BUSINESS; IMPACT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the major determinants that influence the management teachers to practice management consulting. The second objective of this research is to understand how the experience in management consultancy leads to value addition in their class room teaching. Design/methodology/approach - To address the first research objective, focus group discussions were conducted with management teachers practicing consultancy. These results were used to generate items for the questionnaire. Factor analysis performed on the data revealed six determinants influencing management teachers to engage in consulting activity. To address the second research objective, focus group discussions with MBA graduates were used to comprehend how teachers with management consulting experience enrich the pedagogy. Findings - The major findings of the study suggest that the determinants influencing management teachers to practice consulting are: improving competencies, furthering professional advancement, accruing strategic and financial benefit, enabling holistic development. Through study 2, the authors found out that management teachers add value in pedagogy by forging corporate world connection through real-time examples, enable critical thinking by breaking established paradigms, effective classroom delivery through storytelling, etc., and lending student support by assuming a mentor's role. Practical implications - This study found that faculty consulting reduces the perceived gap between the industry and academia and it also leads to effective class room teaching. Originality/value - The study is the first attempt to empirically test the determinants influencing management teachers to practice consultancy services and qualitatively assess how the consultancy experience enriches the in-class performance.

This paper analyses the assessments made by a group of engineering company employers. An item-battery of 20 competencies was grouped into 3 dimensions by using factor analysis. Subsequently, respondents' scores were also clustered into three groups and characterised through contingency tables. The competencies demanded by employers were grouped into business and finance, problem-solving and strategic planning. Significant differences were found between responses from employers working in medium and small companies, who placed more importance on competencies related to problem-solving and strategic planning, and employers in big companies, who were more concerned about the difficulties of finding well-trained graduates. The findings from this paper have important implications for research in the areas of higher education and organisations that usually employ graduate engineers.

The role of the Design Manager in mid-large scale Public Sector Co-Design Projects	DESIGN JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference of the European-Academy-of-Design (EAD)	APR 12-14, 2017	Sapienza Univ Rome, Fac Architecture, Rome, ITALY	European Acad Design	Sapienza Univ Rome, Fac Architecture	Activating citizens; design manager; co-design; public sector engagement		Co-Design is very challenging in a public sector context yet the role of Design Management in this field is seldom touched on in literature. Using an action research approach we present 3 case studies of mid-large scale of co-design projects. Focussing on how the challenge of activating citizens and managing complex multi stakeholder projects were addressed through a Design Manager role. We explore the evolving role of the Design Manager, and the skills and human qualities required for them to work across strategic, management and operational strands in complex, collaborative projects. From this we present a model of Design Management for managing community-led co-design projects to create calm waters for co-design. The contribution of a model of Design Management for co-design in the public sector can be applied to the facilitation of any co-design project. In conclusion we make 3 key insights and recommendations in relation to the model.

After the implementation of the National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL) in 1998, it has accentuated the change from the state to the private model. The present study sought to analyze the strategy of a multinational company, pioneer in the electric power transmission sector, to adapt to changes in industry regulation and increased competition. The qualitative analysis methodology was used, having as theoretical reference the Delta Model of strategic positioning. Data were collected through semi-structured questionnaire aided interviews, involving the company's board of directors and managers, and were interpreted using content analysis. The results of the research demonstrated that the strategies adopted by the company, after the changes in the business environment, can be explained in the light of the Delta model of Hax & Wilde II (2001). It was concluded that the strategies adopted by the company were efficient to keep it in the lead of the market and that the Delta Model was an important method for the strategic positioning analysis.

J	de Oliveira, JC; Rabechini, R				de Oliveira, Jairo Cardoso; Rabechini, Roque, Jr.			Selection of projects portfolio in information technology area	REVISTA GESTAO & TECNOLOGIA-JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY			Portuguese	Article						Portfolio Management; Project Management; Information Technology; IT	MANAGEMENT	Information technology projects are presented as sources of obtaining competitive advantage as they automate activities and reduce the variations of the results of productive processes. This feature has increased the amount of IT projects placed for the evaluation of companies, which extrapolate the physical and financial capacity to undertake them, requiring a selection process that is always linked to the strategic dimension and has defined criteria for it. Portfolio selection methods were developed to answer the question of how to carry out this prioritization. The focus of this study verified the adherence of theoretical methods of selecting IT projects to the reality of large companies that undertake IT projects for their own use. The method used in this work is the multiple case study, characterized by qualitative evaluation. The results obtained show that the project selection process is done in at least two stages, using the funnel model. An important aspect verified in the research that was not verified in the theoretical models is the need to attend projects that meet legal requirements common to the IT area.

J	De Rosis, S; Barsanti, S				De Rosis, Sabina; Barsanti, Sara			Multi-level determinants of tele-healthcare: a case study in Italy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						tele-healthcare; THC; e-health; healthcare technology; implementation science; stakeholder perspectives; innovation management; change management; co-production; case study; Italy	ACTOR-NETWORK THEORY; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; COMPLEXITY SCIENCE; DIFFUSION; TELEMEDICINE; INNOVATIONS; IMPLEMENTATION; ORGANIZATIONS; TELEHEALTH; ADOPTION	The routine deployment of tele-healthcare solutions in healthcare systems and at the system-level is challenging and often problematic. This article reports the results of a case study in Tuscany (Italy), aimed at investigating the factors that may affect these processes. A multi-level and multi-stakeholder sample of 32 informants were interviewed in-depth about topics based on a previous literature analysis. Crucial determinant factors in the management of tele-healthcare services were identified in relation to technological, individual, organisational and contextual aspects. A reorganisation of healthcare in line with more participatory dynamics of teamwork, and more collaborative relationships within and among healthcare organisations, as well as with other stakeholders could contribute to integrate tele-healthcare into practice. Leadership and a strategic vision could also strongly influence the implementation and deployment of tele-healthcare.

Considerable hardware and software infrastructure will need to be developed to survive and/or compete in the AEC context and to be involved in this activity the Thai construction industry must enhance its competitiveness. This paper aimed to determine the factors affecting the competitiveness of Thai construction industry within the AEC. The qualitative approach was employed as the vehicle to fulfill the research objective. In-depth interviews were conducted with 32 key informants selected through a purposive sampling method. The finding revealed that there were 21 factors affecting the competitiveness of the Thai construction industry which eventually were synthesized into 7 abstract categories: National Condition, Factor Condition, Demand Condition, Context for Finn Strategy and Rivalry, Firm Operation and Strategy, Government, and Industry Support Institutions. The top five factors were found to be: 1) companies resources and methods of operation, 2) companies strategic processes and marketing, 3) the characteristics of the workforce, 4) the policy of government towards Thai companies seeking to work internationally and 5) the political and legal settings within Thailand.

Design/methodology/approach - The author guarantees the theoretic validity of the proposed approach, by showing that it possesses desirable properties such as monotonicity. This allows for a reduced implementation time and thus a real-time use of the model. Findings - The author conducts a comparative study with two other multicriteria decision aid models on a set of real data regarding a power plant sitting problem and highlights some of the limitations of previous models compared to the proposed approach. Originality/value - This paper describes a novel multicriteria decision aid model, entitled SPADE (which is an acronym for Structuring Preferences to Aid DEcisions). It aims at consolidating SWOT analysis with sound decision-theoretic techniques, and making use of its results to support decision-making.

J	Derenskaya, Y				Derenskaya, Yana			ORGANIZATIONAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT MATURITY	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						project; project management; organizational maturity; organizational maturity model; levels of organizational maturity		The present article is aimed at developing a set of recommendations for achieving a higher level of organizational project maturity at a given enterprise. Methodology. For the purposes of the current research, the available information sources on the components of project management system are analysed; the essence of "organizational maturity"and the existing models of organizational maturity are studied. The method of systemic and structural analysis, as well as the method of logical generalization, are employed in order to study the existing models of organizational maturity, to describe levels of organizational maturity, and finally to develop a set of methodological recommendations for achieving a higher level of organizational project maturity at a given enterprise. The results of the research showed that the core elements of project management system are methodological, organizational, program technical, and motivational components. Project management encompasses a wide range of issues connected with organizational structure, project team, communication management, project participants, etc. However, the fundamental basis for developing project management concept within a given enterprise starts with defining its level of organizational maturity.The present paper describes various models of organizational maturity (staged, continuous, petal-shaped) and their common types (H. Kerzner Organizational Maturity Model, Berkeley PM Maturity Model, Organizational Project Management Maturity Model, Portfolio, Program & Project Management Maturity Model). The analysis of available theoretic works showed that the notion 'organizational project maturity" refers to the capability of an enterprise to select projects and manage them with the intention of achieving its strategic goals in the most effective way. Importantly, the level of maturity can be improved by means of formalizing the acquired knowledge, regulating project-related activities, and documenting best practices and potential difficulties. Practical implications. For the purposes of the present research, the level of organizational project management maturity of the enterprise in question is evaluated according to the three-level model developed by H. Kerzner. The conclusion is made that project management maturity of this enterprise corresponds to maturity level 2. Besides, the defined maturity level is specified in more detail along the life cycle phases in order to determine more precisely the position of project management activity of the enterprise within the maturity model. Potential problems (the so-called "bottlenecks") of the enterprise in the field of project management are identified. Based on the results of the analysis, a number of recommendations are suggested for further development of the corporate system of project management at the given enterprise. The results of the research showed that in order to achieve a higher level of maturity, it is necessary to create a project team, organize a project office, and distribute project management functions among the team members, develop a procedure of involving experts with different professional backgrounds into the project implementation, improve the procedure of creating project teams, ensure the accumulation of best practices of project implementation, establish the corporate standard of project management, and improve the strategic planning for project management, project implementation control, managing changes, labour resources and communication. The suggested guidelines are expected to facilitate the achievement of a higher level of maturity. They also envisage the terms of this transition and the responsible executives. Further enhancement of maturity level is achieved by means of performing a set of activities for improving and aligning various project management sub-processes aimed at managing costs, time, quality, and risks. Another important condition of enhancing organizational maturity is the development of an integrated management system that would help to achieve synergy from combining different methodologies. Value/originality. Assessment of the project management maturity and identification of problems made it possible to develop a set of recommendations for achieving a higher level of organizational project management maturity by the enterprise in question, which in its turn is expected to reduce the costs and the time that are necessary for project implementation.

J	Di Minin, A; Quan, XH; Zhang, JY				Di Minin, Alberto; Quan, Xiaohong; Zhang, Jieyin			A comparison of international R&D strategies of Chinese companies in Europe and the USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Chinese multinational corporations; R&D motive; R&D structure; Learning mode; USA; Europe	MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISES; DEVELOPMENT LABORATORIES; JAPANESE; GLOBALIZATION; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; PATTERNS; INNOVATION; NETWORKS; LOCATION	Europe and the USA are the two popular overseas R&D investment destinations for Chinese companies. We explore whether there are significant differences or similarities in the comparison of international R&D strategies of Chinese MNCs in Europe and the USA. Specifically, we examine how Chinese MNCs implement R&D strategies to facilitate learning. We adopt the method of theory building from case study research to answer this question. Based on 14 R&D units of 12 Chinese companies in Europe and the USA, our analysis investigates and compares the R&D strategies of Chinese multinationals in Europe and the USA, focusing on their strategic motives, R&D structure, and modes of learning. Our findings have strong managerial and policy implications.

J	Dienemann, S; Stubner, S				Dienemann, Sabina; Stubner, Stephan			Familiness on a dead-end street? The evolution of the familiness concept and its suitability for future research on family firms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURING			English	Article						familiness; familiness concept; familiness evolution; familiness definition; literature review; family business; family firms; family firm research; family business research; resources; resource-based view; RBV; competitive advantage	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; TOP MANAGEMENT TEAMS; UNIFIED SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE; BUSINESS RESEARCH; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; F-PEC; SOCIOEMOTIONAL WEALTH; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY	More than 15 years after the introduction of 'familiness' into the literature, the term has evolved into one of the most popular concepts in family firm research. Despite the steadily growing body of studies that build on familiness, recent calls suggest a need to revisit its conceptualisation due to a lack of a common understanding that could affect future research endeavours. In our systematic literature review of 25 studies, we find support for this notion and show that the discussion on the concept has reached a dead end. We present a systematisation of familiness research that highlights an inconsistent conceptualisation, a lack of validation and even a partial hijacking of the term into contexts different from those originally proposed by Habbershon and Williams (1999). Based on these findings, we present a research agenda aimed at overcoming the current limitations and rejuvenating familiness as a suitable approach to understanding family firm heterogeneity.

What tools do they use to gather and employ data for decision-making and evidence-based management? Are the same tools and techniques useful for all types of libraries? Although there are established measurements and metrics for academic libraries, there are few, if any, for others such as hybrid presidential libraries which are not part of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) system. This column identifies the metrics used by the pre-NARA presidential libraries and compares them to metrics used by a subgroup of Carnegie Research 1 and Research 2 libraries, those that do not participate in Association of Research Libraries (ARL) statistics program. It identifies similarities and differences.

Training as a Strategic Axis for Tourism Enhancement of Cultural Heritage	ALMATOURISM-JOURNAL OF TOURISM CULTURE AND TERRITORIAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Cultural Heritage; Local Development; University; Training; Enhancement of Cultural Heritage	INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE; REGIONS	This paper is intended to underline the importance of human capital and adequate professional advanced training in the field of cultural heritage as a core asset for local development. Through the example given by the Italian experience within the project MODI-FY, we argue that the development of integrated models of management of cultural assets requires specific professional skills which are not always provided by universities. An exploratory survey helps to describe the state of the art of the national educational framework and its main weaknesses and potentialities, in order to outline enhancement strategies able to implement virtuous behaviours in sectors such as tourism, which are crucial to local development.

J	Fang, T; Schaumburg, J; Fjellstrom, D				Fang, Tony; Schaumburg, Josephine; Fjellstrom, Daniella			International business negotiations in Brazil	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING			English	Article						Culture; Brazil; International business negotiations	CROSS-CULTURAL MANAGEMENT; CHINESE	Purpose - The purpose of this study was to explore an innovative strategy for studying the Brazilian negotiator's unique and paradoxical characteristics from a cultural point of view to acquire a better understanding of the nature of international business negotiations in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach - The study is of a qualitative nature, using a multiple-case study design at three levels (small-, medium-and large-scale negotiations). Interviews were conducted with Brazilian and German managers to capture the emic-etic view of the Brazilian negotiator. The Strategic Trinity Model was developed to assess the behavior of the Brazilian negotiator in agreement with three metaphors: "African Capoeirista", "Portuguese Bureaucrat" and "Indigenous Warrior". Findings - The three roles "African Capoeirista", "Portuguese Bureaucrat" and "Indigenous Warrior" comprised similar as well as contradicting characteristics. The Brazilian negotiator chose naturally and even paradoxically from these role features, effectively negotiating any given situation, context and time. During the pre-and post-negotiation phases, traits of the "African Capoeirista" and "Indigenous Warrior" were the most salient. During the formal negotiation phase, however, the characteristics of the "African Capoeirista" and "Portuguese Bureaucrat" dominated. Research limitations/implications - International business negotiations in Brazil call for an in-depth comprehension of the paradoxical roles that local negotiators take on to achieve better negotiation outcomes. Originality/value - The present study unveiled the contradicting Brazilian negotiating style in international business negotiations, thus acquiring a better understanding of the negotiation process in the Brazilian market.

Preliminary Considerations on Cultural Tourism in Abruzzo as a Strategic Tool for the Renewal of the Regional Tourist Offerings	ALMATOURISM-JOURNAL OF TOURISM CULTURE AND TERRITORIAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Cultural tourism; Tangible heritage; Cultural itineraries; Integration; Abruzzo	HERITAGE	Although the number of initiatives of place promotion, the Abruzzo tourism offer remains essentially polarized around two basic segments (the seaside/summer segment and the mountain/snow-based one) and it strongly depends on the proximate tourist demand. Actually the Abruzzo region holds a wider and varied heritage, composed by cultural attractions, historical and architectural resources, wine and food potential and, more generally speaking, a lot heterogeneous environments and landscapes. These resources could respond to the new philosophies of tourism demand, characterised by the experiential motivations of peacefulness, tranquility and soul regeneration in a very close contact with nature. The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential tourism usability of the Abruzzo cultural heritage assessing the levels of the distribution of accommodation facilities and attractiveness. A more aware and integrated tourism offer may produce complementarities both at product and territory levels and may also absorb some critical issues of the regional tourism industry (no awareness of cultural tourism potential, the fragmentation of public policies, the inability to cooperate with a networking mentality).

IT enterprise activities and methods of staff quantity optimization under the terms of freelance resources attracting with the aim of taking leadership positions in the market for IT services. Methodology: during the research, the following scientific methods are used - the methods of analysis, synthesis, and comparative analysis (studying demand and supply of freelance-resource of small IT enterprises), the economic-statistical method (statistical analysis of empirical data, analysis of variation series of demand and supply distribution of freelance applications for a small IT enterprise). The purpose of scientific research: the purpose of the article is to provide theoretical justification for using freelance-resource within a small IT enterprise under the terms of freelance services demand and supply studying, which allows taking leading positions in the field of market relations in the sphere of IT services. The conclusion of the research: the calculation of the full-time employees' optimal quantity of small IT-company is made, which is the most important task of determining the reasonable need for staff to ensure the company's leading position in the field of market relations of IT services. The purpose of the paper is to the research the competitive advantages and a leading position of a small company in the dimension of global market relations in the field of services, which is determined the use of online freelance-resource by small IT enterprises. This approach belongs to the strategic management of expenditures of a small enterprise, which is the basis of the effective resources using a small enterprise and there is a prerequisite for establishing its leading position. The scientific achievements, which consider freelance-resource in the context of the export-oriented sphere of services as a new vector of the economic growth of Ukraine, are systematized; the author's approach to the definition of the category of "freelancers" and the consideration of the essence of freelance activity special features are presented. To determine the minimization of expenditures, the activity of a small IT enterprise is analysed, within which full-time employees are working, whose employment depends on the number of freelance-applications for jobs, which are receiving over a period of time for the IT enterprise needs. The statistical analysis of demand and supply within a small IT enterprise is proposed, which determines the optimal quantity of full-time employees who complete the technical tasks based on the freelance-resource, which enables a small IT enterprise to take a leading position in the field of market relations among similar small enterprises. Today, in the new concepts of the network economy and the global reputation economy, there are trends that represent an objective reflection of modern transformational changes in the economy, which are associated with the use of freelance-resource, which is an essential factor in establishing the leading positions of enterprises in competitive markets.

J	Garcia, HC; Kolbe, D				Garcia, Haydee Calderon; Kolbe, Diana			Dynamic capabilities of Eport Service Providers in the Fruit and Vegetable Sector: Approaches to Overcome Internal Export Barriers	GERMAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS			German	Article						dynamic capabilities; distribution of fruit and vegetables; export performance; export service provider	BORN-GLOBAL FIRM; MARKET SUCCESS; PERFORMANCE; INTERNATIONALIZATION; COOPERATIVES; PERSPECTIVE; INNOVATION; VENTURES	Intermediaries are the mainstay of fruit and vegetable commercialization in foreign markets. However, they face strategic problems that undermine their competitiveness and impede their international development. In order to compete in export markets, these mainly small and medium-sized enterprises require dynamic capabilities which are not possessed by all of them. Existing research has not fully researched dynamic capabilities which determine the success in the exportation of fresh fruit and vegetables. Based on seven indepth interviews, our contribution in this work is to determine what specific dynamic capabilities of the fruit and vegetable distributing companies contribute to an improvement in the export performance. The results of the conducted explorative and qualitative study show that four dynamic capabilities, the relationship management, the consumer orientation, the transparency and the communication along the value chain and brand management can help to solve most of the internal barriers and strategies and as a consequence influence positively in the export results.

Design/methodology/approach - The approach taken integrates Hart's natural resource-based view of the firm with discourse theory. Findings - A conceptual model of the relationship between discursive practices and strategic change is proposed. Research limitations/implications - The paper's model serves as a foundation on which future empirical research on the effectiveness of specific discursive practices can be conducted. Originality/value - Much of strategy research is notable for the absence of discussion on human actors and actions. The paper helps to fill this gap, contributing to existing scholarship by examining the micro-foundations of sustainability strategy through the fundamental role of individuals' discursive practices.

It has become an integral part of business and affects the results of commercial activities. The methods for the assessment of office leasing options that are available at the moment are imperfect, as they lack complexity and they are not related to the objective of the lease the improvement of business results, imperfect methods for a quantitative assessment of the lease options, etc. The adequacy of the assessment of lease options largely depends on the system of indicators that is used. The system is formed on the basis of a list of indicators composed from different sources. For the system of indicators to fully reflect the analyzed phenomenon and to be suitable for a quantitative assessment, there have to be not too many or too few indicators in the system. This means that the indicators that are insignificant have to be eliminated from the list. The most precise way to do that is to apply methods of mathematical statistics. The research is based on the analysis of scientific literature and the methods of mathematical statistics.

J	Goussevskaia, A; Arruda, C; Lotfi, S				Goussevskaia, Anna; Arruda, Carlos; Lotfi, Samir			Capability transformation through acquisitions The interplay between interest alignment and knowledge leveraging mechanisms	MANAGEMENT RESEARCH-THE JOURNAL OF THE IBEROAMERICAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Mergers and acquisitions; Capabilities; Organizational change; Process research	CAUSAL AMBIGUITY; ACQUIRING FIRMS; INTEGRATION; MICROFOUNDATIONS; MERGERS; ACCULTURATION; ORGANIZATION; ANTECEDENTS; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE	Purpose - Firms across many industries use acquisitions as a vehicle for renewing their capabilities. Many such acquisitions fail to achieve their goals, mainly because of the trade-offs involved in managing the post-acquisition integration process. The acquisition integration process not only is an important phenomenon by itself but also offers a unique opportunity to gain insight into how firms transform their capabilities more generally. Recent strategic management literature has begun to recognize the importance of incorporating individual-level cognitive, motivational and behavioral mechanisms into firm-level explanations, although empirical studies within this vein have been scarce. Design/methodology/approach - This longitudinal inductive study traces the process of capability transformation in an acquisition of a medium-size entrepreneurial firm by a larger corporation. Findings - The authors found that capability transformation involved a continuous interplay of knowledge leveraging and interest alignment mechanisms, converging around a set of practices that were considered critical for the capability. Only after firms achieved an agreement about this set of practices that knowledge leveraging efforts translated into actual performance. Originality/value - The study contributes to the literature on competitive advantage by developing a better link between the potential advantage derived from the availability of knowledge-based resources and the translation of this availability into actual firm performance. This study also advances knowledge on managing post-acquisition integration process by demonstrating which managerial skills and actions contribute to the integration capability.

J	Hamdani, F; Ayed, L; Boulanouar, BWA				Hamdani, Fadoua; Ayed, Lazhar; Boulanouar, Bronwyn Wood Aisha			The absorptive capacity as a key success factor in international strategic alliances: a study of Tunisian firms	JOURNAL FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						international strategic alliances; ISAs; absorptive capacity; strategic alliance success; learning	MNC KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; INNOVATION; CAPABILITY; VENTURES; HRM	International strategic alliances (ISAs) are an engine of corporate business development in Tunisia. This research - in accordance with the knowledge-based view - seeks to identify the role of absorptive capacity as a key success factor. In a two-step process, qualitative research was first conducted to centre the research on the characteristics of the Tunisian context. This was followed by quantitative research using a SEM method with data collected from 119 Tunisian firms allied with foreign firms. Results show that alliance experience, and access to the knowledge of the ally, are the most important factors denoting absorptive capacity in this context. Companies engaged in ISAs, with much technological diversity, need to stimulate interest in research and development (R&D) to improve the abilities of their employees and keep them motivated. This leads to an internalisation of knowledge transfer which stimulates business development and leads to successful alliances in terms of effectivness and innovation.

J	Hryshyna, N; Khmarska, I				Hryshyna, Nataliia; Khmarska, Iryna			THE CONCEPTUAL BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL BUSINESS POTENTIAL IN THE REGION	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						potential; small business; region; strategic growth priorities		The article deals with the study of conceptual foundations of the development of the potential of small business in the region. The purpose of the article is to study the essence and features of small business potential and to form conceptual foundations of its development at the regional level. The subject of the research is theoretical, methodological, and practical aspects of the potential of small business in providing a sustainable economic growth. In the course of the research, the following general scientific and special methods are used: dialectical, system analysis, graphical analysis, matrix, mathematical modelling in economics, and logical generalization of results. The essence of the category "small business potential of the region" is studied; it should be understood as a complex system of balanced and mutually related elements in the form of conditions, resources, and opportunities for small business enterprises in the region to conduct production, economic, commercial, and other activities in order to ensure public needs in terms of sustainable economic growth. Methodological principles for forming a conceptual model for the development of small business potential and the scheme of generalized stages of its implementation (preparatory, analytical, operational stages and stage of introduction and implementation) are determined, the implementation of which will help to determine the preconditions for the formation of strategic potential, assess its modern quantitative and qualitative composition, and make a forecast of prospects of the use in ensuring sustainable economic growth. It is proposed to use economic and mathematical models, by means of which it is possible to quantitatively describe the connection between the input indicators of the economic system and the performance indicator. In order to substantiate directions of development of the potential of small business in the region in view of its role in creating new jobs and increasing employment as one of the important indicators of sustainable economic growth, it is proposed to build an economic-mathematical model, the main parameters of which are generalized indicators of the level of labour potential, material-technical potential, financial potential, innovation and infrastructure potential. The use of the proposed methodological approach to the substantiation of directions for developing small business potential will determine possibility and probability of selecting necessary measures to improve certain of its structural elements and their consideration in the development of small business development programs, the selection of sources of its financing, which should facilitate the intensification of business activity as an important factor of flexibility of the regional economy, ensuring competitive activities, capable of becoming a foundation for the renovation of economic growth.

J	Hugentobler, HK				Hugentobler, Hans Kaspar			Hacking the organization: Organizational Transformation by Design	DESIGN JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference of the European-Academy-of-Design (EAD)	APR 12-14, 2017	Sapienza Univ Rome, Fac Architecture, Rome, ITALY	European Acad Design	Sapienza Univ Rome, Fac Architecture	strategic design planning; organizational development; organizational transformation; organization as social system; organization design; design for transformation		Today's organizations are facing the challenge of almost constant change. This paper suggests that design can play a bigger role in organizational transformation, one that is on structure, based on conversation, and focused on thinking in terms of change processes. By asking: "How might design influence organizational change and system behavior in organizations - understood as social systems?" we hypothesize that addressing this question through the lens of Strategic Design Planning will shed light on a set of potential competencies needed for that level of work. Accordingly the paper synthesizes and discusses key literature from three areas: organizational change, organization as social system, and design for transformation. The result points to overlapping concepts that converge into a common statement as basis for empowerment in human systems driven by design. The research contributes to an understanding of the design organization interface.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT	POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						project management; mergers and acquisitions; market life cycle; firm life cycle; product life cycle		In this article we examine the dynamics of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) from the perspective of Project Management (PM). The concept of lifecycle model has been around for many years now, yet much is to be gained by applying the same concept and analysis to retrieve and shed the light on key factors and dependencies of M&A strategy within the Market Life Cycle (MLC), the Firm Life Cycle (FLC) and the Product life cycle (PLC) model. Firstly, we will revisit these three life cycles that M&A strategy depends on. The M&A strategic project is easier to implement if these cycles are in similar phases where PM plays an essential role in the M&A process. Then we will present the comparative literature of both PM and M&A success factors where we have found a substantial overlap between the two. The main contribution of this article is to reinforce the existing studies on M&A related studies while emphasizing the importance of PM processes to undertake M&A venture with focus on some of the critical factors deemed relevant in lifecycle approach when extrapolated to M&A project. The article draws upon an empirical database of M&A activity in the hi-tech sector developed by post-graduate students over several years.

The purpose of this paper is to explore Global Suppliers's approach to implementing the GSLCM and examine how its leaders have adopted and applied themodel. Design/methodology/approach - The primary method of data collection in this single, descriptive case research design was interviews with leaders across Global Suppliers. Findings - Results revealed adoption occurred through extensive sensemaking and several methods of knowledge transfer, including storytelling and teaching assignments. Manner of application varied under three themes: development of the self and others, performance management, and creating new paths. Three recommendations to promote further adoption and application emerged: align rewards and recognition, share stories across the enterprise, and embed processes and systems. Research limitations/implications - This study was broadly intended to discern the processes and activities occurring as leaders became exposed to, explored, and integrated the GSLCM, data that was of immediate, practical significance to Global Suppliers in fueling its strategic reorientation. With this focus, treatment of the literature and extant theory was abbreviated. Further, as a single case study research design, generalizability was restricted. Originality/value - Results provide a compelling, intimate portrait of a worldwide organizational effort to synergize leadership and strategic growth capabilities using a chiefly emergent approach. This illustration thus makes a unique contribution to the leadership development, organization development, and change management literature streams.

Thus, the logistic regression (logit model) had given three fundamental results. The first had shown that the main policies in matter of fight against money laundering (anti money laundering law AMLL, suspicious transaction reporting STR, the criminalizing of terrorist financing CTF) have had positive effects on the increasing of probabilities to realize more growth. The second is that the said policies have had positive effects on the increasing of the degree of openness of the whole sample. The third is that the variable (proximity) had a positive and significant effect on anti-money laundering policies.

J	Jalali, SH				Jalali, S. Hossein			Partner Capabilities and Alliance Time Frame: An Analysis of International Strategic Alliances from the CEE	JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND INNOVATION			English	Article						strategic alliance; alliance time frame; partner capabilities; partner selection	SELECTION CRITERIA; COLLABORATION; PERSPECTIVES; PERFORMANCE; INDUSTRY; MARKET; TRUST; SME; FIT	Partner selection is one of the most discussed issues in strategic alliances literature. However, the majority of research has typically focused on generic partner characteristics and presented conceptual models for alliance partner selection, addressing clan image but only limited pieces of the partner selection puzzle. Rooted in the resource-based view, this paper suggests that partner selection is contingent upon the intended time frame of strategic alliances and presents a new and intensive conceptual framework that examines the appropriate partner capability for strategic alliances, in the case of short/medium-term alliances and long-term ones. Based on empirical evidences from 736 alliances in the CEE region, the findings stress the differences between varied partner capabilities in short/medium-term and long-term alliances. Accordingly, the significance of technological capability increases with the number of year's alliances endured. Moreover, the importance of market capability decreases significantly when alliances last for a longer time frame.	[Jalali, S.

Design/methodology/approach - A literature study was conducted on the strategic importance of assessing and aligning organizations' operations for alliancing. Furthermore, an instrumental case study was conducted to provide insight in the degree of operational alignment required for a maritime organization to form a service alliance. Findings - Managers indicate a complex set of organizational capabilities required for improving operating process to successfully execute their alliance strategy. Two improvement trajectories were found to be used by alliance managers for aligning operations with alliance strategy: development of a corporate alliance infrastructure, and nurturing a collaborative business culture. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to one public organization establishing a vertical service alliance with one of its suppliers. Originality/value - The paper introduces a new conceptual model of the alliance formation process, addressing the cyclical character of the pre-formation stage in which intra- and interorganizational management considerations alternate.

J	Khudyk, O				Khudyk, Olha			STRATEGIC FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE FLOUR-AND-CEREALS INDUSTRY'S ENTERPRISES CAPITAL	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						capital; financial leverage; financial strategy; strategic financial analysis; structure of capital		The article is devoted to the theoretical and methodological principles of strategic financial analysis of capital. The purpose of the investigation is to develop the methodology aspects of the capital structure optimization of the flour-and-cereals industry's enterprises. Methodology. The dialectical method of understanding the economic processes is the theoretical and methodological basis of the investigation. Such methods are used for achieving the purpose of the article: analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, abstract and logical method, comparison, modelling, methods of economic statistics, fuzzy sets. Results. On the basis of the present state of the methodology of the strategic financial analysis of company's capital, it is theoretically grounded methodological approach to the capital structure optimization of the flour-and-cereals industry's enterprises. As the result of the research, it is established that the level of equity profitability and effectiveness of company's financial and economic activity are connected with the structure of funding sources. Therefore, to determine the target capital structure, it is proposed to take into account comprehensively such factors as the adjusted profitability of capital (assets) before interest and weighted average cost of capital. Since the company's equity is characterized by a certain value, to determine the criterion of optimal capital structure, it is necessary to take into consideration the amount of expenses to maintain the existing funding structure. So, there is the necessity to use the modified model to assess the effect of financial leverage, considering the average cost of capital. The utilization of this criterion requires establishing additional limits of the optimal capital structure formation: restrictions on the functioning capital adequacy, on the level of financial stability, on the inalienability of differential of financial leverage, on the level of financial risk. The obtained results have the practical value because they contribute to systems integration of the strategic financial analysis of capital and the financial management requirements and create conditions for its implementation in practice of domestic enterprises. Value/originality. The suggested model of capital optimization can be used to determine its structure according to the necessity in loan capital and its limit value, which may involve the company at an acceptable level of financial risk.

J	Kihn, LA; Nasi, S				Kihn, Lili-Anne; Nasi, Salme			Emerging diversity in management accounting research The case of Finnish doctoral dissertations, 1945-2015	JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE			English	Article						Accounting history; Accounting change; Management accounting; Research methodologies; Theoretical approaches		Purpose-Several scholars have recently highlighted the narrowness of accounting research regarding it as a threat to scholarly developments in the field. The aim of this study was to chart progress in management accounting research using a sample of doctoral dissertations published in Finland. In particular, the study examines the range and diversity of research strategic choices in Finnish dissertations over time, including the topics and methodological and theoretical approaches chosen. The authors also briefly compare findings over time and with other progress studies. Design/ methodology/ approach-A longitudinal historical investigation was selected. All of the 80 management accounting doctoral dissertations published in Finnish business schools and departments during 1945-2015 were analysed. Findings-The findings reveal that an expansion of doctoral education has led to an increasing diversity of research strategic choices in Finland. Different issues have been of interest at different times; so, it has been possible to cover a wide range of cost, management accounting and other topics and to use different methodological and theoretical approaches over time. Consequently, management accounting has become a rich and multifaceted field of scientific research. Research limitations/ implications-While this analysis is limited to doctoral research in Finland, the results should be relevant in advancing the understanding of the development of management accounting research. Practical implications-Overall, the findings support the view that there have been, and continue to be, many ways to conduct innovative research in the field of management accounting. Social implications-Dissertation research in this field has been extensive and vital enough to educate new generations of academics, guarantee continuity of the subject as an academic discipline and make management accounting a significant academic field of research.

J	Klius, Y; Chizh, V				Klius, Yuliia; Chizh, Vira			STRATEGIC ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES ON THE BASIS OF THE USE OF "CORPORATE INNOVATION MANAGEMENT CHART"	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						analysis; innovations; corporate management; development; chart		Intensification of innovation activity of enterprises requires a qualitatively new organization of interconnections and interaction between all participants of the innovation process. The spreading of forms of corporate ownership and management in Ukraine has led to the development of corporate governance, whose strategic focus is becoming a top priority in the management of industrial enterprises. The introduction of an effective corporate innovation management system enhances competitiveness and economic efficiency by ensuring due attention to the interests of investors, management, and other participants in corporate relations; financial transparency, the introduction of effective management and control rules. The purpose of the article is to substantiate the use of "corporate innovation management chart" at industrial enterprises in conducting a strategic analysis of their effective development. Methodology. Methodological basis of the work is a set of methods and principles of scientific knowledge, general and special methods and techniques used during the study. The theoretical basis of the research is fundamental positions of the general theory of systems and innovation management, the theory of corporate management, scientific works of domestic and foreign scholars in the field of innovation management and corporate governance. The legal framework of the study is the current legislative and regulatory documents regulating the innovation activity of enterprises and corporate governance. For the achievement of the set purpose during writing of the article, the following methods are used: method of system analysis (for the definition of conditions of functioning of the corporate system of management of innovations); modelling (in the development of a mechanism for managing the effective development of an industrial enterprise with the use of "corporate innovation management chart"); graphic (for a visual representation of stages of creating a "corporate innovation management chart"). Practical implications. The obtained results and practical recommendations constitute the methodical basis for the formation of a corporate innovation management system. The results of the most practical significance include: directions of management of effective development of the industrial enterprise are revealed, the need to use "corporate innovation management chart" is proved, the necessity to create "corporate innovation management chart" is substantiated, types of these charts are considered, a model of "corporate innovation management chart" is developed, stages of creation of "corporate innovation management chart" are identified, the team's actions on creation of "corporate innovation management chart" at each stage are studied. Value/originality. It is substantiated that in order to make effective decisions under changes in the competitive environment, it is expedient for enterprises to use special forms of the planning of innovation activity. Form of such planning is the developed "corporate innovation management chart" as a special form of innovation planning, in which the achievement of strategic objectives of the enterprise is based on meeting the needs of consumers of innovative products by choosing organizational, industrial or technological innovations taking into account available resource possibilities for their implementation, which promotes, due to the possibility of viewing and updating the developed chart, making strategic management decisions in terms of changes in external and internal environment of the enterprise.

J	Kranjac, M; Sikimic, U; Tomic, S; Vapa-Tankosic, J				Kranjac, Mirjana; Sikimic, Uros; Tomic, Srdan; Vapa-Tankosic, Jelena			The Contribution of EU Funds to Wellbeing and Sustainable Development in Central European Countries	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						sustainable development; foreign aid; economic integration; environment		The European strategic goals are good standard of living, social and economic wellbeing and sustainability of the Planet Earth. Some of these requirements are contradictory. Often times, a successful economy exhausts nature well beyond its limits. Europe is achieving its goals by giving funds to many programs, thus enabling the elaboration of projects. The programs' and projects' goals and results must justify the global vision of European Union (EU) future, precisely defined in the document Europa 2020: to achieve a sustainable future. This paper is dealing with effects of the use of EU funds in Central European (CEE) countries. The authors are analyzing correlation between Happy planet index (HPI) and wellbeing indicator with absorption of EU funds. HPI shows the efficiency of residents of different countries in using environmental resources to lead long, happy lives. It reflects how satisfied are residents and what is the level of ecological constrain to reach this satisfaction. Happy planet index measures if it is possible to have good lives without depletion the Earth too much. It is combination of four factors: life expectancy, experienced wellbeing, inequality of outcomes and ecological footprint. The results of authors' research prove the hypothesis that funds are bringing wellbeing in terms of satisfaction of CEE citizen, but by rejecting the hypothesis that funds are leading to the sustainable development they come to the conclusion that this satisfaction is consequence of the use of natural resources over the limit needed for the sustainable future of the coming generations.

J	Kudriavska, N				Kudriavska, Nataliia			THE MODEL OF INTERACTION BETWEEN INSURANCE INTERMEDIARIES AND INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE ASSURANCE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSURANCE MARKET	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			Ukrainian	Article						interaction model; insurance market; insurance intermediary; insurance company; effectiveness; stability; European experience; specific of Ukrainian insurance market		The purpose of this paper is the investigation of the model of interaction between insurance intermediaries and insurance companies in the assurance of sustainable development of the insurance market. The methodology is based on the new studies and books. It is underlined the importance of potency and effectiveness of this model, its influence on the insurance market stability. It is analysed the European experience and specific of Ukrainian insurance market. The main ways for improving its model and ways of its practical realization are characterized. Results. The problems that exist in the broker market in general are connected with an ineffective state policy. In particular, we can say about the absence of many laws, acts, resolutions, which explain what a broker have to do in case of different problems with insurance companies, another brokers and clients. At the same time, the problem of distrust to national brokers exists. It provokes a decline of the demand for their services and so on. However, it is possible to solve these problems. Practical implications. For this, it is necessary to do some acts. The first one is to implement resolutions that regulate relationships between insurance brokers and insurance companies, clearly regulate the model of its interaction.This model affects the stability of the insurance market in general. The second is to find methods of solving problems of the increase in insurance culture of the population (for example, by the way of advertisement). The third one is to solve problems connected with the appearance of foreign brokers in the insurance market of Ukraine. Actually, the Ukrainian market of insurance brokers is not developed enough. That is why it needs big changes and reforms. Value/originality. Among alternatives of the strategic development of insurance, the method of quick liberalization and gradual development is distinguished. According to the liberal way, it is possible to transfer to the market mechanisms of functioning of insurance both in the inside and outside markets. The gradual development includes the state defence of national companies until they will be competitive.

A key strategic priority for the Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation (ONF) and Rick Hansen Institute (RHI) is optimizing NP management after SCI. Aims: A National Canadian Summit, sponsored by ONF and RHI, was held to develop a strategic plan to improve NP management after SCI. Methods: In a one-day meeting held in Toronto, Ontario, a multidisciplinary panel of 18 Canadian stakeholders utilized a consensus workshop methodology to (1) describe the current state of the field, (2) create a long-term vision, and (3) identify steps for moving into action. Results: A review of the current state of the field identified strengths including rigourously developed evidence syntheses and practice landscape documentation. Identified gaps included limited evidence on NP hindering recommendation development in evidence syntheses, absence of a national strategy, care silos with limited cross-continuum connections, limited consumer involvement, and limited practice standard implementation. The panel identified key themes for a long-term vision to improve the management of SCI NP in Canada, including establishing an integrated collaborative network; standardized care and outcome evaluation; education; advocacy; and directing resources to innovative solutions. The panel identified the next step as prioritization of areas that will have the greatest impact in a 5-year time frame. Conclusion: A strategic plan outlining a long-term vision to improve management of NP after SCI in Canada was developed and will inform future activities of the sponsors.

IMPLEMENTING A MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR ENHANCED DATA MANAGEMENT AND INSTITUTIONAL EFFICIENCY - A CASE STUDY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA	JOURNAL FOR NEW GENERATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Decision-support; management information; institutional effectiveness; data management; strategic planning		The integration of university performance data with the strategic goals of a university to enhance institutional efficiency is a complex process. This article aims to illustrate the importance of the alignment of performance data with decision-support needs linked to the strategic goals of a university by means of a case study from the University of Pretoria (UP). The enhancement of the capability for monitoring and evaluating faculty indicators and departmental performance against the strategic goals of the university is illustrated through the implementation of a new management information system (known as HEDA)(1). The focus of the article is to demonstrate the importance of integration and monitoring of the university's strategic plan for improvement in institutional efficiency. The alignment of UP's operational indicators with its Annual Performance Plan submissions required by the Department of Higher Education and Training is also outlined. The practical use and process followed for the adoption of the management information software at the university is discussed as well as the lessons learnt so far, in an attempt to monitor and integrate institutional planning at all levels.

It is a common knowledge currently that collaboration has always been a constructive characteristic of any organization. However, it becomes more and more ubiquitous, and practically expands into new forms and areas with new relations. Co-competition as a current reserve at any enterprisemay grow into effective tool to support a specific industry or industrial territory in conducting innovative events. Innovative forms of collaboration between industrial organizations have become buzz-words so urgent in connection with their significance for the organizations trying really hard to improve competitiveness of their products and with that purpose using innovative energy and resource saving technologies, which in turn help them decrease dramatically their wastes. The study was made on the bases of a modelling technique as the leading method that is able to assist in examining the issue in the frames of a well-directed and managed process aimed at improving the integral aspects of the qualitymanagement systems of industrial enterprises. The authors propose their arguments and recommendations concerning viability of innovations in industry collaboration.

J	Ma, DL				Ma, Da-Lai			The cooperative relationship between smallholders and rural brokers in contract farming: the evolutionary game model analysis	JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Cooperative Relationship; Smallholders; Rural Brokers; Contract Farming; Evolutionary Game Model	SCHEMES	This paper employs an evolutionary game model to analyze the cooperative relationship of contract farming between smallholders and rural brokers, which simulates the strategic options and analyses for the long-term stability in different situations. The result shows that there are two strategic statuses of the long-term stability on the relationship of smallholders and rural brokers, which both sides adopt the cooperative strategy or the noncooperative strategy simultaneously. To enable both sides to adopt a stable cooperative strategy, their incomes must be greater than the cooperative costs, transaction costs and risk costs in contract farming. Otherwise, the stable strategy adopted by both sides in the long run is non-cooperative.

J	Macpherson, WG; Lockhart, JC				Macpherson, Wayne Gordon; Lockhart, James C.			Understanding the erosion of US competitiveness Managed education and labor in Japanese "corporate castle towns"	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT HISTORY			English	Article						Japan; Competitive disadvantage; Corporate castle towns; Managed education	SYSTEM	Purpose - For the past three decades, the dominant economic policy environment across the Anglosphere has assumed that industrial performance results from increasing national competitiveness. The US Government and others have extensively used the tools of deregulation that emerged from the influential frameworks of Michael Porter and the Chicago School. That both the contributing analysis and attendant policy environment largely neglected the very source of national disadvantage, mostly Japanese industry in the 1970s and 1980s, remains surprising. What was going on in Japan at the time, and to some extent continues today, remains largely hidden. The aim of this paper is to expose one source of Japan's influential competitive advantage - the human resource. Design/methodology/approach - This paper, through the translation of a Japanese-language paper by Professor Emeritus Masaki Saruta, introduces the Japanese phenomenon of managed education in Aichi Prefecture, home of the Toyota Motor Corporation, and provides insight into the lifestyles of the Japanese workers who live and work in corporate castle towns that feed Toyota. Inductive content analysis was used to identify four themes that can be identified as the strategies used to produce a homogenous pool of labor that sustains the Toyota Way philosophy and Toyota Production System. Findings - The content analysis identified four major themes: Toyota's abnormal level of influence over local government, a unique education system of education management, a closed labor market and the homogeneity of labor. It is only now that business leaders in the Anglosphere are able to comprehend the vastness and depth of inculcation and nurturing policies of Toyota and other Japanese industrial giants - something business leaders in the Anglosphere today can only dream. Itnowbecomes evident that Chandler's visible hand remains alive and well, but critical drivers of its success in Japan and Toyota were largely invisible to the West. Research limitations/implications - The research required the knowledge of one of Saruta's works that is only published in Japanese, and therefore, inaccessible to researchers in the Anglosphere. The translation process and development of themes is reported in detail. The findings are then located in the broad context of national competitive advantage. Practical implications - With the insight presented in this paper, business and government leaders may now be empowered to implement policies and practices to nurture a pool of labor more conducive with the organizational strategic policy. While leaders in the Anglosphere are able to implement policy, there also remains a new threat to economic sovereignty - the nurturing of human resources in the dormitories, refectories and shopping malls of industrial China. Social implications - The development of a company-focused workforce to support corporate castle towns, one of the sources of national advantage, has been identified in this paper. The social implications are twofold. First, in Japan, the nature and influence of these towns are accepted and heralded by the community. Second, outside of Japan, and especially across the Anglosphere, these towns are a major source of competitive advantage. Originality/value - Through the translation of original research published in the Japanese-language medium, this research provides otherwise inaccessible insight into the inner workings and effectively the "black box" of what was Japan Inc. in an era when business people in the West were playing catchup. As the debate on globalization extends to sovereignty across the Anglosphere, it is beholden on the academic community to provide effective solutions for industrial competitiveness.

In Australia, there are very few examples where collaborative NRM projects have been implemented on this scale, let alone be subject to a robust evaluation. Documenting the path taken to submit and implement the single application as well as evaluating the delivery model to determine if it provides a more cost effective and strategic way of delivering NRM projects is critical. Managing a single project with twelve organisations requires ownership, commitment and flexibility from all partners. Through the development and implementation of a robust M&E framework, the Reef Alliance will have a much better understanding as to the impact of the collaboration and whether it is a more strategic and cost effective model to generate water quality outcomes.

Therefore, it is important to detect possible non-conformances to mitigate them efficiently in a timely manner. However, few previous studies have dealt with success at the operational level or the factors used to evaluate a global selective outsourcing situation. We defined a set of evaluation factors based on our review of the relevant literature. This paper aims to examine the quality of operational practices in the following units of Nokia devices: the information technology (IT) unit; the logistics delivery quality (DQ) unit; and the corrective action preventive action (CAPA) unit. These case units selectively outsourced their IT service and insurance claims management activities. Action research, interviews and surveys were used to collect data. We analysed the case units' operations and identified new operational-level indicators and interdependences to identify the success of their outsourcing-based operations. The findings of our study contribute new knowledge about selective outsourcing at the operational level, which could be exploited by other global selective outsourcing projects.

J	Malihi, K; Shee, H				Malihi, Kristina; Shee, Himanshu			STRATEGIC VEHICLES IMPORT SUPPLY CHAIN: A PARADIGM SHIFT IN AUSTRALIAN AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY	ASIAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						parts forecast heuristics; make-to-stock inventory; vehicles import supply chain; lead time; automotive industry; Australia	PRODUCTION SYSTEM; TO-ORDER; INTEGRATION; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; TOYOTA	This study aims to formulate a buffer stock-adjusted make-to-stock (MTS) parts forecasting heuristic, which has the potential to ease the tight dispatch lead time issue facing first tier suppliers in vehicles import supply chain. The research is motivated by an issue of justin- time (JIT) parts dispatch to auto companies partly due to inadequate lead time given to the first tier suppliers. Compiling secondary data from industry sources, we estimated the overseas shipment time and parts dispatch lead time while developing heuristics to forecast vehicles parts requirement with due care for buffer stock. Results suggest a strategic hybrid approach combining MTS parts ordering with JIT supply to auto manufacturers. MTS will help first tier suppliers to source and stock parts in-house that can be supplied just in time to help completing vehicle fitment. This approach is likely to ease the lead time pressure of first tier suppliers without affecting JIT supply to the automotive companies. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications for Australian first tier parts importers as well as automotive companies.

The aim of this paper is to identify the main authors, journals and studies that have informed the intellectual platform underpinning BPR as well as identifying the topics that have had the greatest impact. In this study, bibliographic references cited between 1959 and 2012, are analyzed using different bibliometric techniques. Three main results are found: first, the intellectual basis for this field involves a multidisciplinary and multifaceted literature, although the disciplines of finance and management are the principal contributors to research into BPR. Second, authors, journals and papers are identified to track the main framework of portfolio restructuring. Finally, the main forerunners of this study area are corporate strategy, divestitures, diversification and corporate governance. This is a study that contributes not only to the field of strategic management but also to information management.

J	McIntosh, B; Sheppy, B; Zuliani, JD				McIntosh, Bryan; Sheppy, Bruce; Zuliani, Juan David			The emperors clothes - corporate social responsibility creating shared value and sustainability	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						business strategy; business sustainability; creating shared value; CSV; corporate social responsibility; CSR	ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING; BEHAVIORAL ETHICS; ORGANIZATIONS; STRATEGY; NETWORK	Corporations in the 21st century play a decisive role in the future of society. Their power and influence in world affairs often seems devoid of ethics and seems to exceed the reach and the means of many nations. As a result, the strategic positions they take towards value, creation and ethics affects every individual on the planet. This paper explores strategic routes that organisations could apply to facilitate economic growth while ensuring their ecological integrity and ensuring social enhancements generates benefits to a wider scope of organisational stakeholders. By conducting a critical analysis and clarifying common misconceptions between corporate social responsibility (CSR), creating shared value (CSV) and sustainability, it is possible to determine how these interrelated strategic approaches have evolved. This article argues the importance of transforming the purpose of organisations to encapsulate stakeholder value creation as the main reason for their existence.

J	Meglei, V				Meglei, Viktor			SPECIFICATIONS OF ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR OF UKRAINE	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						agrarian sector; agrarian system; public administration; market regulation; agrarian production; plant growing		The subject of the author's research is the processes of development of the agrarian sector of Ukrainian economy by ecological-economic specifications. The methodological justification is based on the use of fundamental principles that reflect the main strategies of agrarian development. The systematic approach to the characteristics of the agrarian system, complex by the structure and functional parameters in interaction with the external environment, is applied. Methods of analysis/synthesis are used for the disclosure of the integral nature of the agrarian environment in the context of management of the main processes. The purpose of the author's research suggests a consideration of the processes of formation of the agrarian system by economic and environmental interactions as modern dominant in the development of the agrarian sector of Ukraine. The analysis of integral components of agrarian development with the reflection of interactions of the sphere of agrarian production and agrarian relations is carried out. The emphasis is made on the importance of the formation of an effective and promising domestic agricultural policy, in the basis of which is the activation of entrepreneurial initiatives, comprehensive development of the agrarian community, ecologically and socially oriented projects of reproduction of rural territories, innovative strategies of ecological and economic ascension of agriculture in Ukraine. The resource base is considered as the economic basis of agriculture from the standpoint of the main sales markets, the state of transport infrastructure, the growth of world and domestic demand for agrarian raw materials and finished products, and the availability of relatively cheap labour resources. The agrarian production is analysed from ecological positions and influences of natural and climatic factors.The state of individual agro-ecological mismatches in agriculture of Ukraine is explained, as well as the reasons of polluting impacts on the main natural spheres and some other unfavourable environmental actions. An attention is focused on the importance of reproduction of the Ukrainian agrarian sector on the basis of the adjustment of the system of state regulation and on the definition of the coordination mechanisms between the sphere of influence of the state and market elements of the national agrarian economy. The motivational goals, operating target facilities, main directions of administrative tasks for the development of the state regulation system based on economic and environmental criteria are substantiated. The importance of managerial approaches in the system of state regulation of the development of domestic agricultural production on the example of plant growing is specified.The dependency between the production of crops by gross collection, yield, and annual needs of the country are analysed, in particular, by the food and export potential of individual plant crops, etc. The analysis of the most important strategic positions for the development of the domestic agricultural sector in the system of state regulation of Ukraine for the near future is carried out. Corresponding conclusions to the author's research are made, reflecting the analysed specifications of development of the agrarian sector of Ukrainian economy by ecological and economic indicators. At the same time, modern for Ukraine approaches are proposed in the field of agricultural management, as well as new regulatory accents to stimulate agrarian development in specific areas.

A new approach to General plan of the city in a complex strategic design in conjunction with the system of settlements is studied. Results. A methodology is proposed for the development and implementation of the Strategic program of the Russian city in which the General plan of the city is part of the program, acquiring new interdisciplinary content and guarantee the implementation due to their permanent development and joint implementation. Conclusions. Deficiencies are identified in the existing methodology of designing master plans of Soviet cities inherited the new Russia point to the need for a new approach to General plan of the city and its Metropolitan area and new direction in Russia, i. e. Strategic planning The implementation of the principles of Strategic planning requires a different approach to professionals. A model of mechanisms of professional urban and agglomeration management is suggested.	[Men'shikova, Ye.

J	Mirkatouli, J; Samadi, R				Mirkatouli, Jafar; Samadi, Reza			AN ANALYSIS ON THE ROLE OF URBAN LAND MARKET IN SPATIAL DEVELOPMENT OF CITIES: A CASE STUDY OF MASHHAD, IRAN	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Urban land market; Spatial development; Neighborhoods development; TOPSIS; Mashhad	COMPACT CITY; AREAS; MODEL; STATE; PRICES; SET	The purpose of this paper was to study the role of the urban land market in the spatial development of Mashhad. In this study, factors such as the status of buying and selling land, standard deviation of habitants' income, changes in green space, land-use realization rate, and building violation formed the indicators for appraising the land market. The MORRIS model was used to evaluate the rate of development of this case study in three general groups, namely economical, social-cultural, and spatial-physical. The TOPSIS model was also used in classifying the development of each urban district. The effect of each development indicator on the general development was attained by using multivariate regression. The results showed that the economical development indicator has the highest effect on total development of the district. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to study the relationship between each indicator of the urban land market and the development of neighborhoods in this district. The sale indicator for the effect of the urban land market on urban district development was evaluated by the causal modeling method, which has the highest influence on the spatial development in Mashhad. In fact, owing to the price of land in some neighborhoods, selling and buying of land increased - it resulted in land speculation, development of some parts of the district, and reduction of spatial equality among neighborhoods. It is suggested that introducing a more accurate tax system can reduce urban land speculation.

This research also examined the effect of transformational leadership as a moderating factor on mosque organisational effectiveness. This study found that mosque leaders were able to produce a comprehensive BASO model-based documented strategic intentions for all four sample mosques. The present study also evaluated s post test results six months later of the selected mosques' short term action plans. Empirical data showed technical consultancy, peer review meetings and management support are mediating factors of mosque organisational effectiveness. Therefore, this BASO model-based strategic planning training supported by training follow up sessions is reliable and can be applied to other rural mosques within and without Malaysia.

Forest Management: Past, Present and Future	LESNOY ZHURNAL-FORESTRY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						forest resource and usefulness; forestry; forest management; forest regulation; continuous sustainable use of forest; sustainable yield; multi-resource forest management		The paper considers the basic provisions of the forest management system taking into account the history of its development in Russia and other countries, including Germany, where it originated. Special attention is paid to the functional purpose, content, methodology of strategic planning within the forest management and its relationship with the Federal Law no. 172-FZ "On Strategic Planning in the Russian Federation", adopted by the Government of the Russian Federation in 2014. The forest management was abolished by the last Forest Code of the Russian Federation (2006). This fact negatively affected not only the forest management, but also the state of the forestry sector of the economy. The basic concepts established earlier in the forest science and practice were also distorted. The paper considers the key concepts of forest management and its specificity predetermining the origins of the forest regulation; two-level nature of strategic forest management planning; its methodology; other functions of forest management, including forest inventory, assessment of the past economy, organization and calculation of continuous sustainable use of forests; economic justification of forest programs formed in forest management in the territorial entities of the Russian Federation and their forestries; mechanism for their implementation; recommendations for the improvement of forest management and control over it. The supplied conceptual provisions can be used in the development of a new forest management instruction.	[Moiseev, N.

J	Mostova, A				Mostova, Anastasiia			A METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO THE STRATEGIC ANALYSIS OF FOOD SECURITY	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						strategic planning; strategic analysis; food security; SWOT-analysis		The objective of present work is to substantiate the use of tools for strategic analysis in order to develop a strategy for the country's food security under current conditions and to devise the author's original technique to perform strategic analysis of food security using a SWOT-analysis. The methodology of the study. The article substantiates the need for strategic planning of food security. The author considers stages in strategic planning and explains the importance of the stage of strategic analysis of the country's food security. It is proposed to apply a SWOT-analysis when running a strategic analysis of food security. The study is based on the system of indicators and characteristics of the country's economy, agricultural sector, market trends, material-technical, financial, human resources, which are essential to obtain an objective assessment of the impact of trends and factors on food security, and in order to further develop the procedure for conducting a strategic analysis of the country's food security. Results of the study. The procedure for strategic analysis of food security is developed based on the tool of a SWOT-analysis, which implies three stages: a strategic analysis of weaknesses and strengths, opportunities and threats; construction of the matrix of weaknesses and strengths, opportunities, and threats (SWOT-analysis matrix); formation of the food security strategy based on the SWOT-analysis matrix. A list of characteristics was compiled in order to conduct a strategic analysis of food security and to categorize them as strengths or weaknesses, threats, and opportunities. The characteristics are systemized into strategic groups: production, market; resources; consumption: this is necessary for the objective establishing of strategic directions, responsible performers, allocation of resources, and effective control, for the purpose of further development and implementation of the strategy. A strategic analysis of food security consists of two blocks: the analyses of the external and internal environment. It is proposed, in order to improve the validity of the strategic analysis, to evaluate strengths and weaknesses, threats, and opportunities at the time of analysis, as well as to explore the trends of their change in dynamics. For this purpose, the author proposed establishing the persistence of the identified strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities. To accomplish it, the persistent strengths of possibilities include, in the author's opinion, characteristics with a positive dynamic over the examined period while the persistent weaknesses and threats include, accordingly, those with a negative dynamic. Practical implications. Result of the present research is the advanced matrix of a SWOT-analysis of food security, which complements traditional method with the grouping according to the basic strategic groups of food security (production, market, resources, consumption), as well as the level of persistence of strengths and weaknesses, threats and opportunities, depending on the dynamics of the proposed characteristics. The main practical outcome of the developed procedure is the list of strategic recommendations based on the identified strengths and weaknesses, threats and opportunities of food security, depending on the level of their persistence. The value and originality of the scientific results are in that as a result of the proposed procedure, there will be built an effective instrument for carrying out a strategic analysis of the country's food security. Based on the strategic analysis of the persistent strengths, the author identified the main com-petitive advantages of the country's food security, which are to be strengthened, while implementing supporting strategic measures and control. It is established that the non-persistent strengths of food security of Ukraine would require a more effective management in comparison with those persistent, as well as development of an efficient mechanism of government support and regulation. Minimization of the impact of persistent weaknesses on the level of food security and their transformation into strengths should be carried out under the condition of reforming the social policy of the state and creating a system of the state support for the agricultural sector. The task on resolving the problems associated with the impact of threats in accordance with the level of their persistence has to be dealt with gradually, with the further development of strategic measures to neutralize and protect food security and the factors that affect it, in particular, to utilize the potential of external opportunities.

J	Mpwanya, MF; van Heerden, CH				Mpwanya, Musenga F.; van Heerden, Cornelius H.			A supply chain cost reduction framework for the South African mobile phone industry	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES			English	Article							IMPLEMENTATION	Background: The costs incurred in the provision of products and services across the supply chain are on the rise in many industries, including the mobile phone industry. Despite this, there is limited information in South Africa on the perceptions of supply chain players regarding cost reduction in the mobile phone industry. Furthermore, there is currently no framework for reducing supply chain costs in the South African mobile phone industry. Aim: The purpose of this study is to explore supply chain costs in the South African mobile phone industry, and to develop a supply chain cost-reduction framework for the South African mobile phone industry. Setting: This study explores supply chain costs in four mobile phone companies operating in the South African mobile phone industry, of which three mobile network operators and one mobile retailing group. It uses semi-structured interview data collected in 2011. Method: This study adopted a qualitative case study design to understand supply chain costs and develop a supply chain cost-reduction framework for the South African mobile phone industry. Eight semi-structured interviews with managers of mobile phone companies were conducted. The data were analysed with the help of Atlas. ti, using an adapted three-phased analytical framework as suggested by Miles and Huberman (1994) and O' Dwyer (2004). Results: The study found that consolidation of strategic relationships through collaboration and strategic alliances between MNOs and other supply chain players is one of the ways to drive costs down across the supply chain. Outsourcing of some of the support activities and retailers' direct purchasing transactions from device manufacturers were also found to be other avenues for reducing supply chain costs in the industry. Conclusion: The study suggests that mobile network operators (MNOs) need to consolidate their strategic relationships by increasing the share of the network infrastructure, and emphasising the need to strive for operational efficiencies. This combined effort should result in significant cost reductions across the supply chain. The findings of this study provided some avenues that managers of mobile-phone companies could consider to drive costs down supply chain-wide and service end-users at lower rates. The findings of this study could also help regulating authorities to get insights into supply chain cost reduction and develop appropriate mobile phone policies in South Africa.

J	Myeunghwa, L				Myeunghwa, Lee			A Study on TOPIK Writing Error Patterns among Korean Learners - Focusing on Expository Writing of No.53-	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL NETWORK FOR KOREAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE			Korean	Article						Test of Proficiency in Korean (TOPIK); expository writing; error pattern; foreign learner; TOPIK composition		This study intended to analyze cases of Composition No. 53 in the Test Of Proficiency In Korean (TOPIK) and identify error patterns among Korean learners. The subjects included language school students. Grade 3 students were first exposed to Composition No. 53 officially; those in Grade 4 were taught it once; and those in Grade 5 were taught it twice or more. Findings reveal that education regarding the evaluation criteria of students before they begin writing for TOPIK No. 53 is required. The students should receive sufficient practice and repetition regarding the evaluation criteria content and performance of tasks, the developmental structure of a text and discourse markers, expressions in written language, and morphologic and semantic teaching and learning of Korean. In addition, they need to develop a strategic time management plan. To improve TOPIK writing abilities it is essential to repeatedly practice writing similar forms of TOPIK No. 53, receive feedback, and attempt writing again. Given the broad postposition distribution among Grades 3, 4, and 5, it calls for reorganizing postposition education according to beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. This inevitably implies revision of teaching materials to ensure students learn postpositions in stage-appropriate contexts. Grade 4 learners' Composition 1 was compared with their Composition 2; results indicate that they should receive personal feedback to prevent repeating errors and have their compositions rechecked after rewriting. This study was limited in that it failed to generate reliable results with additional composition cases, but is significant as it analyzes the error patterns in TOPIK compositions and proposes teaching and learning directions to prepare for TOPIK more effectively.				mon627@empas.com						0	0	0	0	1	INT NETWORK KOREAN LANGUAGE & CULTURE	SEOUL	DEPT KOREAN LANG & CULT STUD, R, 401, 133 DONGSUNG RD, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 00000, SOUTH KOREA		1738-2793		J INT NETW KOR LANG	J.

J	Nazir, Z				Nazir, Zulfiqar			The Role of Human Cognition in The Management Decision Making In The Health Care	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED BIOTECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH			English	Article								In the modern healthcare system, many different decision-makers interact to care for patients and manage operations. To clarify the roles and responsibilities of different decision makers, the researcher consulted with previous work that described the decision makers in healthcare organizations and the decisions that they make. The researcher searched online databases for articles that described decision making in healthcare and manually searched journals and the bibliographies for other review articles. The researcher identified six key roles: doctors, nurses, front-line managers, middle managers, senior level managers, and the board of directors. The researcher classified clinical decisions into three categories: diagnosis, treatment and therapy, and medication prescription and administration. The researcher classified non-clinical decisions into five categories: budget, resource allocation, technology acquisition, service additions and reductions, and strategic planning. The researcher then summarized these roles and responsibilities. These activities yielded a comprehensive picture of which personnel in a hospital make which decisions. Since organizations are decision making systems, this comprehensive picture of decisions and their decision makers will be instrumental in not only analyzing the underlying conditions of the administrative processes in healthcare, but aid in developing tools that healthcare organizations can use to assess their own decision-making processes, and thereby design solutions.

The recommendations in this paper are based on a comparative case study of previous mobile service ecosystems used in Norway. The findings of this study add insights into key success factors for the mobile network operator during the different business ecosystem evolutionary stages. The recommendations include the fact that mobile network operators can succeed in kick-starting contactless mobile payment services by taking a role as a trusted service manager, focusing on establishing the ecosystem and contactless payment service together with partners in the bank sector. Furthermore, in an expansion phase the mobile network operator must open up for collaboration and connect with a portfolio of aggregators, merchants and third party niche players offering secure and high quality services and applications.

UNMANNED AERAL VEHICLE (UAV) TECHNOLOGY IN MONITORING OF COASTAL CLIFFS	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						coastal sliding processes; time-series analysis; erosion rates; monitoring engineering solution; coastal management	BLACK-SEA; SYSTEMS	The UAV technology (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), together with the traditional methods of measuring in situ, is able to provide a full coverage for the inaccessible coastal areas by providing an overview regarding the state of the marine and coastal ecosystems, with accelerated change in recent years. This method allows the collection of images and 3D information and mapping the areas with noticeable spatial changes. The main objective of coastal cliffs supervision by aerial methods is to develop a database, support for sizing the solutions for their protection and fitting them. The results of the evaluation studies on the current status of the marine and coastal cliffs from Romanian coast led to the achievement of a synthetic reference database, by expanding the network of observations and measurements, carried out in 2014-2015, in the cliffs area, comprising a characterisation of the marine and coastal environment changes from the southern Romanian coast and surprising spectacular changes with environmental impacts in its area. Also, the characteristics of the touristic littoral zones and vulnerability of the natural habitats to the changes induced by the human or natural factors in the mentioned period were investigated.

J	Norheim-Hansen, A				Norheim-Hansen, Anne			To ally or not to ally and why high-reputation firms can gain reputation from selecting lower-reputation partners	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						alliance partner selection; decision process; environmental credibility; environmental reputation; exploratory multiple case study; international cooperation; managing director; Norway; reputation asymmetry; reputation spillovers; strategic alliance	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; COOPERATION; RESOURCE; SUCCESS; TRUST; ENVIRONMENT; COMPETITION; GOVERNANCE; INDUSTRY; GREEN	This article addresses a dilemma in strategic alliance partner selection. Prior research has shown that traditionally prospective partners with higher or equal reputations are preferred. Yet, firms can have simultaneously high and low reputations, for different attributes. When key reputations are satisfactory, but others are inadequate, how does the higher-reputation focal firm decide on whether to ally? An exploratory multiple case study utilising managing directors (MDs) - the main decision makers - as unit of analysis, and an inferior environmental reputation, exposes a sequence of considerations. Implications for the focal firm's own environmental credibility are theoretically explored, leading to the proposition that higher-reputation firms can gain reputation from allying with lower-reputation partners. Hence, this study challenges assumptions on reputational consequences of allying with lower-reputation firms.

They are used for multiple purposes, for example, providing economic returns from timber harvest, conservation of biodiversity, provision of wild berries and mushrooms and recreational benefits. People's perceptions of forests and forest use are currently under transformation due to drivers like globalization and urbanization. The aim of this study was to analyse in particular Swedish university student's visions of future forests using a newly developed survey method based on mind mapping. An online survey with mind map technique was used to collect data from university students in Umea, northern Sweden. The study focused on features of forests, products derived from forests and activities in forests. The results indicate that students regard ecological, social and economic aspects of forests as important for future forests and the use of them. In particular, the role of non-wood forest products, like berries and mushrooms, as well as recreational features of forests were central to many of the students. The multitude of different visions suggests that forest management decisions of today, directing the future of forests, need to consider the multiple use of forests to be able to satisfy forest preferences also of younger generations.

Leading a Library Restructure in a Cross-Cultural Organisation: A Vietnam University Library Case Study	JOURNAL OF THE AUSTRALIAN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Leadership; diversity; cross-cultural; restructure; change; case study	LEADERSHIP	In 2015, a solely owned Australian international university library in Vietnam underwent major changes that included a new staff structure. At the beginning of the year, an Irish-Australian Senior Library Manager was newly appointed to manage a team of Vietnamese library staff. The library service was reviewed and restructured to better align with the organisation's strategic objectives in relation to research, learning and teaching. The challenges in leading and managing a library restructure in a cross-cultural context are examined from both Eastern and Western leadership perspectives. This case study illustrates that although cultural differences can be perceived, similarities in effective leadership and management are key to implementation success.

However, the MV Sewol incident revealed the absence of the organizational learning in the Korean disaster management system. With mixed methods of content analysis, in-depth interview, and social network analysis, this study identified key failure factors in response to the incident and categorized them by managerial, structural, and institutional domains. While the Korean government took bold steps to rebuild its risk management system, those efforts were biased to structural reforms and lacked fundamental changes in human and informational resources management. Based on the findings, this study suggests the balanced efforts for system refinement for effective risk management.

J	Ondoua Biwole, V				Ondoua Biwole, Viviane			A survey from 2005-2015 of the new theoretical and methodological approaches to a better understanding of the commitment of SMEs to CSR	REVUE INTERNATIONALE PME			French	Article						Commitment of SMEs; CSR; Organizational theory; Strategic management; Reflective stance	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; SMALL BUSINESS; MANAGEMENT; ENTERPRISES; SIZE	This article aims at positing new theoretical and methodological approaches to better understand the commitment of SMEs to CSR. The state of the art of the publications from the best ranked journals from 2005 to 2015 shows that out of 83 articles published in 35 journals, organizational and strategic management theories hitherto identified provides a partial picture of the commitment of SMEs to CSR. As a matter of fact, these theories focus on the basis of the large American business, although different from the characteristics of the SME, thereby leading to distorting situations. It was therefore suggested to use the characteristics of Japanese companies which are compatible with the SME. Consequently, the theories identifies may be supplemented by sociological theories such as entrepreneurship, human resources, incentive and convention theories. Furthermore, concerning the methodology, no study presents the point of view of the researcher as a reflective practitioner who may produce different and conclusive results.

This being due to limited resources, among others, this paper aims to propose a simple and low-cost approach to assess the viability of human activities under climate change. Design/methodology/approach - Many human activities are feasible only within a narrow range of climatic conditions. Comparing such "climate corridors" with future climate projections provides an intuitive yet quantitative means for assessing needs for, and the viability of, adaptation activities under climate change. Findings - The approach was tested within development projects in Pakistan, Peru and Tajikistan. The approach was shown to work well for forestry and agriculture, indicating positive/negative prospects for wheat in two districts in Pakistan, temperature constraints for maize in Peru and widening elevation ranges for walnut trees in Tajikistan. Practical implications - Climate corridor analyses feed into the preparation of Local Adaptation Plans of Action in Pakistan. Originality/value - The simplicity and robustness of climate corridor analysis allow for efficient analysis and communication of climate change impacts. It works when data availability is limited, but it can as well accommodate a wide range of complexities. It has proven to be an effective vehicle for mainstreaming climate change into adaptation planning.

Based on European Innovation Scoreboard data a comparative assessment of innovation management have done through three aspects: 1) resource capacity, 2) prospects of business entities innovation activity; 3) innovation activity effectiveness. Analyse for Ukraine has done in comparison with average EU data and also with Poland and Germany. Results. In the article, the place of Ukraine in Europe by innovation development has identified. Retrospective changes of innovation development in Ukraine, Poland, Germany and EU during 2008-2015 have analysed. Despite a big gap between Ukraine and EU in terms of resource capacities and innovation activity prospects of business entities, the level of Ukrainian economy effectiveness sin innovation sector stays stable. The authors have defined substantial differences between systems of innovation management at Ukrainian and European enterprises. Taking into consideration strategic priorities of growth areas of Ukraine and also its integration in EU economy, and based on a comparison of data presented in the European Innovation Scoreboard it was possible to single out a range of discrepancies characteristic of innovation activity management system of Ukrainian and European business entities: managers at Ukrainian enterprises prefer to spend on innovations that are not connected with researches and elaborations; in Ukrainian management system there is almost no experience of cooperation with foreign partners within innovation activity sector; in European countries there are more enterprises which introduce innovation but do not develop them themselves; Ukrainian enterprises' managers lack experience in patenting according to the international Patent Cooperation Treaty and in registering trademarks, projects and designs according to the requirements of European Union Intellectual Property Office. Practical implications. The case study results make possible to innovation activity enterprises of Ukraine and European investor, which work in Ukraine, to develop more successful innovative development strategies of enterprises. Value/originality. The study has identified the necessary improvement direction of innovation management system of Ukrainian enterprises in the context of the specific features of innovation sector of the EU economy functioning.

J	Puteh, F				Puteh, Fadilah			Continued Professional Development and Organisational Performance: A Structural Equation Modelling (SEM)	PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES			English	Article						Continued professional development; formal learning; informal learning; non-formal learning; organisational performance; service-based organisation; structural equation modelling		Literature on Continued Professional Development (CPD) suggests that learning could take place in three dimensions, namely formal learning (FL), non-formal learning (NFL) and informal learning (IL). However, there is a big gap in the literature as much of the discussions on CPD focus on FL and NFL, while studies on the IL component are still vague, under-researched and often overlooked. The effects of CPD and professional competency have been extensively studied but those focusing on the relationship between CPD and organisational performance (OP) are somewhat limited. This papers examines the correlation between CPD components and OP. Data was collected via structured questionnaire from 1120 executives from four different sectors of the service-based industry in Malaysia, namely Multi-National Corporations (MNCs), Malaysian Government Linked Corporations (GLCs), Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), and Malaysian Government Agencies (MGAs) that are located in the Klang Valley. The SEM-PLS was used to show the hypothetical relationships. The model tested in this study shows that CPD components account for 34.7% of the variance in OP. Furthermore, 24.6% explains the prediction effect of CPD components on OP. Overall, the proposed model of CPD has relatively good predictive power on OP. The findings provide invaluable insights with regards to developing a new strategic HRD model for excellent OP via CPD activities. This study also fulfils the demand for more empirical research on CPD, knowledge management, competency and OP.

J	Ridwan, MS				Ridwan, Mohammad Sihab			Planning practices: a multiple case study in the high-performing banks	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Planning; Banking; Strategy; CEO; Flexibility; Decision	ORGANIZATIONAL-EFFECTIVENESS; LEADERSHIP	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the strategic planning practices applied in the high-performing banking industry in the Indonesian context and how decision style facilitates successful planning. Design/methodology/approach - This study employed a qualitative research approach as the framework for this study to get a genuine explanation of the perspectives of participants researched about strategic planning. The data collection method used in-depth semi-structured and unstructured interviews of both key informants and non-planning members in each identified bank. Three banks were selected because of their commitment in strategic planning and their high-performance status. This study used research information from a panel of experts to first define a bank as high performing in the first instance, and then to select the three top performing banks for the study. Findings - This study has provided useful findings about the strategic planning practices in the high-performing banks. The key findings comprise the fact that all three banks in this study have carried out the usual and main strategic planning activities presented in this study: the vital role of the CEO in strategic planning has been proven, and planning flexibility in the strategic planning process has been identified, among other related findings. Originality/value - This study provides a useful research model for investigating strategic planning practices both in the relatively stable and predictable business environment and turbulent and unpredictable business environment. This study, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the first to investigate the issue in the Indonesian context.

J	Rombai, L				Rombai, L.			Knowledge for the Enhancement between Memory and Contemporaneity: Pilgrim's Old and New Routes in Historical Maps (15th-19th Centuries)	ALMATOURISM-JOURNAL OF TOURISM CULTURE AND TERRITORIAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Registries; Methodologies; Historical Cartography		The text analyses the cartography produced between the late Middle Ages and the Unification of Italy (and the Carta d'Italia of the Military Survey Office): among the most important categories of documented sources for the history of viability and the area. The original maps (almost all hand-drawn) prevail, drawn for the ancient states or upper classes for the purpose of military or civil management, control and enhancement of the territory. Beyond the metrics and topographic contents, the utilisation of historical maps requires research in public and private land registries of Italy and other countries, which is not always easy. It furthermore requires a rational critical evaluation of the products and with this the necessary contextualisation of administrative and political-economic-social strategic practice to which they belong. The text addresses historical cartography (general maps of various scales and road types) used for the study of viability, including the numerous pilgrim routes that cross Tuscany from north to south, passing through the Appennino, through the crossings of Lunigiana and Valtiberina. The official Tuscan products, as well as those of its sub-regions and communities (whose road network is highlighted) stand out among others, and also singular street routes, particularly those drawn during the second half of the 18th century and the first decades of the 20th century when the geometric cadastre was completed. Almost all of them were needed to be able to rule the territory and often to plan and carry out important public work as well as modernisation of communication infrastructure.

J	Romero-Martinez, AM; Garcia-Gomez, MC				Romero-Martinez, Ana M.; Garcia-Gomez, Maria Concepcion			The successful takeover of La Sexta by Antena 3: pre- and post-merger factors	MANAGEMENT RESEARCH-THE JOURNAL OF THE IBEROAMERICAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Audiovisual industry; Comprehensive approach; Integration timing; Mergers and acquisitions (M&As); Structural and human integration	M-AND-A; ACQUISITION PERFORMANCE; POSTACQUISITION INTEGRATION; INNOVATION; COMPLEMENTARITY; PERSPECTIVES; TRANSACTIONS; INDUSTRIES; OUTCOMES; SPEED	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the merger arranged in the audiovisual sector between Antena 3 and La Sexta, and specifically the pre- and post-merger factors. This study adopts a comprehensive approach for the analysis of the reasons behind this strategic decision and the role that structural and human integration and the decision on the right momentum and integration speed played in the merger success. Design/methodology/approach - A single case study research method is used. This qualitative methodology provides richer data to understand complex transactions such as mergers and acquisitions (M&As). According to the data triangulation technique, two research methods were used, in-depth interviews and archival secondary data, including confidential reports and archival trade press. Findings - The merger involving Antena 3's takeover of La Sexta in October 2012 has been seen as one of the most successful operations ever undertaken in Spain's audiovisual industry. The main motivation was to increase the organisation's size to make it more competitive in the market, thus reducing costs, generating synergies and improving performance. Structural and human integration has provided the backbone for this success, all at a time marked by the global financial crisis and its knock-on effect on the downturn in the advertising market. Another of the key factors of success was that the changes in the organisational systems and processes were designed and partially implemented before the incorporation of La Sexta. Practical implications - This work has highlighted the need for proper planning and a suitable choice of timing in M&A operations. Management should pay special attention to the integration of human and productive resources to generate synergies on the road to success. Originality/value - This paper's main contribution is to highlight an example of a successful M&A in the audiovisual sector in Spain by adopting a holistic perspective. While there are scarce studies in this industry, previous research on this topic is mostly quantitative and, moreover, the rate of success in M&A is quite low.

In this paper, we analyze an empirical case study in order to gain refined knowledge and develop 'best' implementation tactics, building on Plaza-Ubeda et al., (A case study of stakeholder identification and prioritization by managers, Journal of Business Ethics, 75: 1-23, 2010) conceptualization of the implementation of stakeholder integration (SI). The case study draws on a project concerning our own university, a private higher-education provider, which faces a new regulatory environment. In response to new legal measures, which include accounting for stakeholders, the project aims at evaluating and improving the university's approach to managing its stakeholders. Based on the case observations, we suggest that any practical implementation should start with building on pre-existing organizational routines. Following the emphasis we put on planting the ` seed' of stakeholder thinking into strategic management processes and systems, we postulate to conceptualize practical implementation as interventions, thereby avoiding to 'add-on' new processes and structures. Interventions might help to rethink, or even break up, current routines in order to improve the stakeholder management capabilities of an organization.

J	Sakuraba, A; Shibata, Y; Ishida, T; Hashimoto, K				Sakuraba, Akira; Shibata, Yoshitaka; Ishida, Tomoyuki; Hashimoto, Koji			Design and implementation of disaster management GIS system based on ultra high definition display environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPACE-BASED AND SITUATED COMPUTING			English	Article						information sharing system; display wall; disaster information system; disaster state; resilient network; emergent system; disaster information sharing; cloud computing; space-based computing		In case of large scale disaster, it is very important to collect disaster information and understand them to make decision at counter disaster headquarter (CDH). Existing disaster information gathering and sharing system based on geographic information system (GIS) cannot respond to deal with large scale disaster from the points of the scalability and operability. This paper introduces a new design of disaster state presentation system using large size and ultra definition displaying system in order to collect and share disaster state information to make decision for officers at the CDH. The proposed method displays both GIS based location information and multimedia information in parallel on the same display. These displayed disaster information are interactively controlled using workspace controller to display on tiled display wall (TDW). We designed and implemented our system as a prototype. Through performance evaluation, the effects and future works of our proposed system are discussed.

J	Saragih, HS				Saragih, Harriman Samuel			Critical success factors of recording studio in Indonesia	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS			English	Article						Critical success factors; Key success factors; Indonesia; Music studio; Recording studio; Service excellence	ERP IMPLEMENTATION; MUSIC-THERAPY; SUSTAINABILITY; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; PROJECTS; QUALITY; BANKING; PEOPLE; IMPACT	Purpose - This viewpoint paper is based on consultancy project in developing strategic marketing plan for building a professional recording studio in Bandung, Indonesia. Nonetheless, previous studies that scrutinize the key success factors in music recording studio industry are noticeably lacking, whereas music artists still rely heavily on recording studio providers to record their music and distribute it to the market. Hence, finding out the critical success factors (CSF) can help recording studio to craft strategic marketing plan within effective and efficient budget. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Methods carried out in this study are based on triangulation which comprises of primary observation, interviews to experts in the respective field, and literature reviews regarding CSF, service quality and service excellence. Five years of primary observations took place in five studios on two major cities in Indonesia which are Bandung and Jakarta of which many prominent musicians were originated. The interviews were conducted to six respondents who have more than ten years of experience in music industry, and have produced at least two albums through professional music recording processes in music studios including recording, mixing, and mastering. Findings - It is found that by exploiting the conceptual theories of service quality and service excellence as the foundations, there are primarily three critical factors in music recording studio industry in Indonesia which are human resources development in primarily technical aspects, communication skills, and servicescapes which involve the recording facilities and also the studio surroundings. Research limitations/implications - This study only took samples from five studios, two major cities in Indonesia and limited experts opinion. Nevertheless, confirmatory study is expected in the future in order to gain deeper insights or other additional point of view in determining CSF in the recording studio industry. This paper, however, has contributed to the existing literature of service quality, service excellence, and CSF in a narrow scope of industry which is music recording studio. Practical implications - Managers who wish to start a recording studio business must look deeply into these three critical factors to address the budget effectively and efficiently in initial investment of the studio. Through this study it can be observed that music studio as a service firm can still focus on creating critical values to strive even though the music industry landscape has been deteriorated due to piracy and the development of technology. It is expected that through this study, by understanding the CSF, managers in music recording studio can focus on creating value effectively and efficiently in recording studio business. Originality/value - This study contributes to fill the gap of empirical discussion in determining CSF in the music recording studio business in Indonesia in the context of service quality and service excellence, which has not been examined by previous scholars.

J	Seng, TB; Yew, LK				Seng, Tan Boon; Yew, Low Kin			BUDGETING PRACTICE IN SINGAPORE - AN EXPLORATORY STUDY USING A SURVEY	ASIA-PACIFIC MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING JOURNAL			English	Article						budgeting process; budget gaming; strategic control; performance measure; time cost of budgeting; use of budget		This study is conducted to better understand budgeting practice in Singapore which may be critical for increasing competitiveness and productivity for firms, and increasing value-add contribution for accountants. We obtained 356 valid responses from an online survey administered to members of a professional accounting organization. We found that most firms prepare budget and many (about 30%) incorporate significant strategy assumptions in budgets. The time spend on budgeting (10%-20%) is lower than what was reported in US studies, and more time is spent in preparing than using the budget. Budgeting problems (e.g. ratcheting and sandbagging behaviour) are well recognized, but firms preparing budgets with business plans generally deem pros for budgeting exceeding cons. Firms with annual revenue below $1m prepare budget primarily for forecasting cash flows; larger firms focus more on guiding and coordinating business activities, with increasing importance on variance analysis as firm size increases. For firms that prepare budgets with business plans, employee compensation based on budget performance is not as prevalent as expected. About 70% of the firms set budget targets to monitor strategy execution, about 50% set budget target for employee performance evaluation, and about 43% compensate by budget performance. The implications of these findings are discussed.

J	Shepheard, ML				Shepheard, Mark L.			Farming, Good Neighbours, and Protecting the General Interest in Water Resources: How Effective is the Promise of Sustainable Watershed Management in Quebec?	MCGILL INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT LAW AND POLICY			English	Article								The framework for implementation of sustainable watershed management in Quebec comprises a mix of statutory accountability, compliance with plans, and civil liability. At the centre of this framework is the goal of realizing collective responsibility for the protection and preservation of water now and for future generations. Implementation of this framework to achieve that goal, and the extent to which it enables farmers to deliver sustainable watershed management practices, is a case study in natural resource governance arrangements and sustainable resource management behaviour change. This article reviews governance arrangements for sustainable watershed management in Quebec and presents research on farmer accountability within sustainable watershed systems. The analysis considers the extent to which farmer accountability for protection of water is defined by sustainable watershed management planning processes. Such processes are focussed on strategic imperatives that are not effectively connected with the practice of private rights and interests. With this in mind, I question how effectively accountability for sustainable watershed management translates into practical guidance that enables farmers to manage resources as good neighbours and meet their duty of water protection. Obstacles identified include: a tendency for the National Assembly, regulators, and courts to absolve farmers from liability for environmental harm; the lack of sanctions for non-compliance with a plan; a lack of financial incentives to modify farm practices; and the fact that watershed organizations lack powers to compel participation in the adoption of a plan.

J	Shevchenko, I				Shevchenko, Iryna			THE BUDGET PROGRAM: ECONOMIC CONTENT AND PRACTICE OF IMPLEMENTATION	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						government; budget programs; implementation; state program; budget management; development		The aim of the article is to analyse the practice of the economic content of budget programs'implementation in Ukraine. The definition of the budget program is given. It is noted that, in the Ukrainian legislative area, there is a wide range of programs, namely: programs of economic and social development of Ukraine; Government activity programs; state target programs; local programs for the socio-economic and cultural development. The author reviews in more detail the differences between the budget program and the state target program since it is these types of programs that are most confusing. It is emphasized that there is a certain interconnection between budget and state target programs and a strategic document. Thus, in order to achieve the corresponding goal and fulfil the tasks set out in the paper and aim at solving urgent problems of development, it is necessary to develop concrete ways in the context of branches of the economy. Methodology. The study of the indicators of planned and fully financed state budget programs, planned and spent expenditures for the financing of budget programs for 2011-2015, as well as the polynomial trend of planned expenditures for the financialization of budget programs for 2011-2017, is conducted. The interrelation between elements of budget programs and their characteristic features is studied. Indicators of the implementation of budget programs applied in international practice are considered and analysed, namely: Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, USA. Results. The author systematized the views of scientists on the performance indicators of budget programs. The analysis of the professional literature on this issue allowed generalizing the main classification features, which, according to the author, should be fixed at the legislative level. Practical implication. The author proposed an additional classification mark "Depending on the degree of risk of non-fulfilment of the program". This will allow timely identification of the probability of non-fulfilment of the budget program and its possible cause but also will allow optimizing cash flows and their managers, will not allow assessing the necessity and expediency of combining several budget programs of one main manager of funds into one program; combining them according to the branch principle by transferring to other main budget holders in accordance with their functions; reducing the number of main budget holders.

They can also serve as a tool for increasing transparency and reducing corruption. Yet, open data are still neglected and they are not given enough importance. This might be caused by insufficient information support of open data. The paper aims to analyze the current level of application of open data by a primary questionnaire survey on a sample of private sector companies and public sector organizations in the Czech Republic. The results of this paper represent a comprehensive overview of current open data applications by companies and organizations in the Czech Republic.

This study, performed in 2010 within the context of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in South Africa, aimed to develop a structural equation modeling-based value-mediation governance decision-making model that will enable engineering managers at publicly financed R&D organizations to select optimal governance modes for the research alliances they are establishing to grow their organizations' R&D capabilities.

J	Sutherland, J				Sutherland, John			Employee well-being in Britain: perspectives from the margins of the labour market	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Employee well-being; Disadvantaged workers; Peripheral workers; Secondary labour markets; The precariat	SHAREHOLDER VALUE	Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to examine the employee well-being from the perspectives of: first, individuals who have personal characteristics stereotypically associated with employment at the margins of the labour market and second, of individuals employed in jobs stereotypically associated with jobs at the margins of the labour market. Design/methodology/approach-A set of OLS regressions is used to analyse a data set which has its origins in the Skills and Employment Surveys Series Data Set. Findings-The expectation was that, for the individuals identified, their well-being as measured by a series of indicators would be relatively low. This proved to be not always the case. To illustrate: individuals without qualifications (relative to those who possess qualifications) reported positive experiences of well-being; and individuals in jobs which took little time to master (relative to those in jobs which took time to learn) also reported positive experiences of well-being. Research limitations/implications-The subjective indicators of employee well-being available from the data set offer only a partial psychological perspective of the concept. Originality/value-Although the subject of employee well-being is well-researched, this paper focusses upon an increasingly prevalent group of workers within the labour market, often described as "disadvantaged" (or, using Standing's terminology, the " precariat"). Furthermore, it reports some outcomes which do not conform to the conventional wisdom.

Based on an analysis of the current panorama of global production of ophidian and arachnid antivenoms, it is concluded that they are semi-orphaned products. This is a favorable scenario in which to strengthen public laboratory production. Governments should make a political decision in this regard in the interest of equity in population health. In the Region of the Americas, these actions could be part of a program led by the Pan American Health Organization to ensure the availability of these biologicals in strategically located health centers. Twelve public facilities producing antivenoms have been identified in the Region, including Brazil and Mexico, which are the biggest public producers. These laboratories should be managed like industrial operations that produce tangible goods without ignoring strategic planning. National regulatory authorities should help the public laboratories that produce them by providing necessary technical assistance and consultancy without any loss of impartiality or rigor in the evaluation of their quality management systems. New superior production technologies using hyperimmune mammalian plasma are in the experimental phase; no information on its production has been found in the literature.

Risk communication policy design: Cyprus compared to France and the Netherlands	JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH			English	Article						risk communication; comparative website analysis; Cyprus; France; The Netherlands	INFORMATION-SEEKING; FEAR APPEALS; SOCIAL TRUST; PERCEPTION; MODEL; METAANALYSIS; EFFICACY; BEHAVIOR	This study aims at analyzing differences between risk communication policies in Cyprus, compared to the Netherlands, and France. It analyzes risk communication policies indirectly through a qualitative analysis of the information provided by official websites, which are considered to be proxies of these policies. The websites review will focus on the type of the information disclosed online, and the similarities and differences between the websites, regarding the information provided, the way it is communicated, the backing on credible sources, and the supplying of more information if desired, but also simply through the presenting of the WebPages. The results indicate that the Netherlands and France have created risk dedicated websites besides the ministries' websites with information on risks, prevention and the authorities' actions. There is a gap between strategies. The Dutch strategy is to give more responsibilities to the public, by encouraging individuals to be resilient and responsible for their own safety at a certain level by promoting preventive behaviors. The French strategy is to provide risk-dedicated information to the public, also on prevention and government actions. Opposed to this, the Cypriot authorities simply avoid this strategic question by confining the risk communication to the crisis phase, without entrusting people with a role in risk management, and by strictly one-directional communication, with government delivering and the public digesting (or not). Suggestions for risk communication policy development are discussed.

J	Tsyhankova, T; Bezverkha, I				Tsyhankova, Tetiana; Bezverkha, Iryna			TRANSFORMATION OF UKRAINE'S COMMERCIAL DIPLOMACY: RESHAPING THE MODEL	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						commercial diplomacy; economic diplomacy; export promotion; investment promotion; international trade; trade globalization; trade policy; trade missions; Ukraine		The article examines past and present changes in the system of commercial diplomacy of Ukraine in the context of external and internal, old and new challenges. The aim of the study is to propose recommendations for the improvement of existing model and to identify lessons learned from Ukrainian experience that could be useful for developing countries. The relevancy of the study is conditioned by the need to enhance the effectiveness of Ukraine's commercial diplomacy in the face of existing challenges. The applied methodology is a combination of methods used for theoretical and empirical research (observation, comparison, analysis and synthesis, system and structural analysis). We found that present distorted organizational set-up of Ukraine's commercial diplomacy is the result of the uncompleted process of integration of management of international economic relations to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We argue that the introduction of a unified model is untimely but can be considered as promising in a more distant future. Ukraine's experience shows that without necessary prerequisites (a certain level of economic development and role in international relations, which require clear strategic vision and effective coordination of traditional and commercial diplomacies) and proper implementation, the introduction of the unified model is unlikely to lead to the desired outcome. Results of the analysis also indicate that the promotion of export and investment needs further impetus. Suggested recommendations address both organizational and practical aspects of Ukraine's commercial diplomacy. Their implementation would have a positive impact on the style and effectiveness of Ukraine's commercial diplomacy and, therefore, competitiveness of the national business.

J	van Dyk, HO; Goosen, R				van Dyk, Hendrike Olet; Goosen, Riana			Developing an internal audit planning framework at an operational level by integrating continuous auditing procedures relating to automated controls (Part II)	SOUTHERN AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDITING RESEARCH-SAJAAR			English	Article						IT internal audit; King IV; continuous auditing; operational audit planning; automated controls		The Fourth King Report on Corporate Governance (King IV) requires governing bodies to exercise ongoing oversight of the management of information and the continual monitoring of the security of information. Although the internal audit function is described as a pivotal assurance provider as part of the combined assurance model, King IV does not provide implementation guidance on these continuous oversight and monitoring recommendations. A modern audit technique, namely continuous auditing, could be a cost effective solution for internal audit functions to provide such continuous assurance. In Part I of this series of articles, a strategic and annual (macro) planning framework was presented, which entailed integrating the annual planning processes for traditional and continuous auditing techniques. The objective of this article (Part II) is to develop a framework to implement continuous auditing techniques at an operational (micro) level, specifically focussing on providing assurance on automated controls pertaining to a specific business process and its underlying IT infrastructure. This will enable internal audit functions to provide ongoing independent assurance to governing bodies on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information as envisaged by King IV.

Recent research has indicated that management functions in ECECs have changed and that we are now, in addition to an emphasis on the administrative function, seeing a stronger focus on strategic management in ECECs. The purpose of our article is to map the changing conditions of the ECEC managerial role and contribute to a better understanding of the concept of strategy in the ECEC sector. More specifically, we do so by examining how strategy is developed at different levels in the ECEC sector in Norway, and look at how strategy is understood and executed by managers of Norwegian ECECs. Our study is based on analyses of key policy documents and in-depth interviews with 10 managers in ECECs in mid-Norway.

J	Verhun, A; Verhun, M				Verhun, Antonina; Verhun, Mykhaylo			STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT ANALYSIS IN THE EU COUNTRIES	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						strategic management of enterprises; national and regional strategies; development of small and medium-sized enterprises		The concept of national and regional development strategies for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are studied for a long time, as small and medium businesses are the foundation of the economy and the basis for effective country functioning. The business development program of the European Union countries is particularly interesting because there are several levels that correspond to each other and give full effect on the SMEs development. The EU standards are higher than in non-EU countries; therefore, it is worth considering legislative documents, as well as statistics showing the indicators of openness and access to the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The complexity and comparative novelty of studying such a problem in Ukraine led to the need to explore sources of information in the original language due to the lack of information in Ukrainian or Russian. All these suggest that the problem of creating strategies at the national and regional level is more relevant and important to study in the West that demonstrates the current state. The subject of the study is to analyse the effectiveness of implementing strategies for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises as well as the impact of national and regional policies on their functioning and development in the European Union countries. Methodology. The authors highlighted the peculiarities and main features of the development strategies implementation for small and medium-sized enterprises in the EU countries through a comparative analysis of the legislative framework, statistical and other data that help assess the performance and effectiveness of the implemented strategies. The content analysis helps to identify peculiarities of the implemented strategies in quantitative and qualitative forms. The thorough analysis using the above-mentioned methods allowed doing a qualitative study of national and regional strategies in the context of the development of small and medium-sized businesses in the EU countries. Practical importance is that the results of this study will lead to a wider acquaintance with progressive strategic methods of management of small and medium-sized enterprises. This will enable the plan development of concrete actions to improve the efficiency of enterprise management in less developed countries. In turn, raising awareness on this issue will reduce the number of inefficient and non-innovative enterprises. Scientific novelty of the article is to determine the theoretical basis of the differences that at the current development stage are increasingly manifested as certain contradictions in the compilation and improvement of small and medium-sized enterprises, development of strategies at the national and regional levels. Small and medium-sized enterprises, in their turn, have a wider access to their development. Conclusions. As a result of the main development strategies of small and medium-sized enterprises of the EU countries, there should be identified the differences and common features of different strategies for innovations of small and medium-sized enterprises. The interaction of the national and regional strategy with actual results and existing strategies is explored.

J	Victoria-Mas, M; Lacasa-Mas, I				Victoria-Mas, Maria; Lacasa-Mas, Ivan			Brand equity management strategies of Spanish press firms through their digital extensions	REVISTA MEDITERRANEA COMUNICACION-JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION			Spanish	Article						Brand extensions; brand equity; brand management; media brands; press; social media		Media brands find great opportunities in maintaining their equity through digital platforms. Only some traditional brands have developed management strategies of this value. When digital extensions are not congruent with their original brands, it can dilute its image and be counterproductive. This paper explores up to what extent press brands use their online extensions to improve their value and how they are communicating their brand through them. The method used here, is a content analysis of the online editions and the social network profiles of the 44 newspapers most read in Spain. Results show that press brands are not taking advantage of all the potential digital editions can give to create brand equity. These brands only carry on a partial communication of themselves and not actions that are considered important in brand strategic management, such as the identity definition or the mission concretion. A Discussion of the results allows proposing some brand equity creation strategies for media firms.

Bees algorithm for effective supply chains configuration	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Supply chain; multi-echelon; multi-facility; genetic algorithm; bees algorithm	OPTIMIZATION; NETWORK; COORDINATION; UNCERTAINTY; DESIGN; MODEL	This article proposes a bees algorithm for solving a mathematical model of strategic supply chains planning and design in the globalization context. The model, taken from the literature, involves a multi-echelon, multi-facility and multi-product supply chain in a dynamic environment. Our bees algorithm, the first to be applied to this kind of problem, was adapted specifically to the optimization problem, and its performance was benchmarked against the genetic algorithm (GA) provided by commercial optimization software MATLAB R2011b. This is in order to test its effectiveness in an already known supply chain design problem, which has not been solved yet in optimized way. Several configurations of the algorithm were tested and analysed; the bees algorithm performs better of 10% in quality of solution respect to the GA with equivalent calculation time. The better quality of their solutions and the good calculation time performances have encouraged towards more accurate studies on tuning parameters and an extended utilization of the methodology on problems of logistic systems configuration and supply chain design.

Lifelong learners usually try to combine learning with their professional and family duties. Taking in advance informative decisions about whether they have the necessary time resources to devote to a learning object is crucial, both for psychological and for financial reasons. COURSR2 encompasses information for all temporal aspects of a learning object. For example, a course may have lectures, with cardinality constraints over attending them, labs, mid-term exams, final exams, homework, projects and home reading. The user can also represent his non-educational activities, using the general purpose ontology of the SELFPLANNER intelligent calendar application. By subscribing to a learning object through COURSR2, the scheduling engine of SELFPLANNER's is employed to find viable plans, allowing rescheduling of existing activities. Thus, the learner is able to perform what-if analysis about whether a set of learning objects is compatible with each other, as well as with his other commitments. The latest version of COURSR2 has been deployed and evaluated using real users.

J	Cho, MK; Lee, HY; Song, DB				Cho, Moon-Kyung; Lee, Ho-Young; Song, Dan-Bee			KB Kookmin Bank in Korea	ASIAN CASE RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article								KB Kookmin Bank (KB) was the most prominent commercial bank in Korea. However, KB faced two challenges: declining firm performance and a lack of transparency in corporate governance at the level of its financial group, KB Financial Group (KBFG). By the end of 2012, KB was not a market leader in Korea any more. In addition, a conflict arose between the CEO and some members of the board of directors (BOD) of KBFG when an insider leaked private information to the International Shareholders Services (ISS). The insider reported that certain BOD members decreased firm value by disrupting the senior management's strategic plan to increase the firm's long- term competitiveness, which required attention from institutional investors. KBFG had three issues based on the inside information provided and an independent analysis. First, its CEO had been selected from outside KBFG, and he was under pressure to improve firm performance before his term was over. Second, some KBFG BOD members did not represent the interests of the company's general shareholders, including foreign institutional investors and the National Pension Services of Korea. Finally, the heavy influence of the Korean government was culturally ingrained within the corporate governance structure of KBFG.

J	Danilova, EA; Loktionov, M; Scherbinin, AI				Danilova, Elena A.; Loktionov, Mikhail; Scherbinin, Alexey, I			ON THE ROLE OF THE STATE MANAGEMENT IN THE NATIONAL BRANDING STRATEGY FORMING	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE			Russian	Article						state government; strategic management; national branding; positioning; defense industry; innovations		The article is devoted to an analysis of the state management role in a national brand strategy forming. A communicative branding model should have a basis as a central theme, which has a significant value for the citizens and for the international actors. In the article is viewed that the Russian national brand identity is defined by the key idea of the strong defensible state. Therefore, defense industry can be object field for national branding strategy forming. As a result branding communication may become a national unity basis and an effective state positioning. National branding strategy should be include in the internal and external political conjecture. The military-political crisis in Ukraine, participation of Russia in the military operations in Syria and an increased international terrorism threat actualize political values of national safety. Consequently the theme of the state defense ability could become the national brand identity. So the state as a key actor of the national branding strategy should act system-oriented and elaborately. There is a lot of innovation instruments for the support of innovation actors in defense industry: technological platforms, innovation territorial clusters, federal target programs, state funds etc. The optimal set of these instruments provide innovation potential of the actors in defense industry. So the system of supporting defense enterprises and universities is constructed. Innovation defense enterprises and universities using the innovation instruments form innovation territory potential, territory brands. Innovation belts formed with participation of the defense industry innovation subjects providing for the state safety promote a territorial and national branding. So the sum of territory brands form the national brand of the strong state. Communication representation of defense innovators collaboration and its results provides a sense filling of the national branding strategy. Communication branding policy is directed to the innovation policy support in the defense industry and its representation to the target groups. As a result an effective national branding of Russia brings the global competitiveness and international state influence strengthening.

J	Gaidelys, V; Dailydka, S				Gaidelys, Vaidas; Dailydka, Stasys			USE OF "KNOWLEDGE HOUSE", DWS, DMS AND DSS METHODOLOGY BY COMPLETING A COMPETITORS' ANALYSIS IN THE RAILWAY SECTOR	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"Knowledge House"; DWS; DMS; DSS; TOWS methodologies; railway sector; Dcompetitor analysis		In completing a competitors' analysis in the railway sector by using the "Knowledge House" method, there is frequently a problem of data and information accessibility. The quality of primary information has direct influence on the quality of analytical conclusions. One more condition for the qualitative application of this method is the intellectual capital and experience of the analyst. One should note that in this regard we face another problem, that of selection of proper personnel, on the qualification of whom depends the accuracy of the evaluation and final results, on the basis of which strategic decisions are taken. The main aim of the paper is to assess the opportunities for applications of competitive intelligence methods in the railway sector. The study is using "Knowledge House", DWS, DMS, DSS methodologies. Having analysed the scientific works the direct scientific sources of information, which are oriented to the application of the methods of competitive intelligence to the railway sector, have not been identified. The paper is absolutely original in that until now the competitive intelligence techniques have not been applied for the railway sector companies. Considering the fact that foreign companies, which compete for freighting at the international level, are regarded as the main competitors of the railway sector, the use of the methods of the competitive intelligence becomes more important while fighting for the part of the market. The competitive intelligence methods and their application to the railway sector companies are little studied. In accordance with application of the relevant methods in other sectors, it can be assumed that these innovative approaches could have a positive impact on the competitiveness of companies in the railway sector and their income.

J	Giannoukou, I				Giannoukou, Ioanna			Strategic Development and Operation of Deluxe Hotels Operating in Greece: management contracts vs franchising	JOURNAL OF ORGANISATIONAL STUDIES AND INNOVATION			English	Article						Strategic Development; Hotel Operations; Hospitality Management; Greek tourism; Performance	FIRM FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION; MANAGERIAL EFFICIENCY; ALLIANCE PERFORMANCE; BUSINESS; INDUSTRY; PROFITABILITY; MATTER; MARKET; DETERMINANTS	As business environments become more complex and competition in the hotel industry increases, the majority of hotel owners recognize the need for strategic management to choose an effective operating arrangement. The central tenet behind strategic management is that a properly articulated strategic fit between organizational competence and various environmental situations is critical for good performance. Considering the fact that most business entities are concerned with a unique strategy for improving their performance in dynamic business environments, research should be designed to identify the link between the operating arrangement and performance, through a useful set of guidelines. This study attempts to investigate the effect of strategic alliances (equity and non-equity) on the performance of hotels operating in Greece by hotel chain brands and the efficiency of management contracted hotels in comparison to those hotels that operates in franchising. The results of this study reveal the distinctive characteristics of hotel operation in Greece.

J	Gouws, C				Gouws, Claudia			HISTORICAL EVIDENCE OF WATER MANAGEMENT IN THE VREDEFORT DOME	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HISTORY			English	Article						Cultural history; Parys; Vaal River; Vredefort Dome; water history; water management; world heritage site		The availability of water resources usually determines where communities of people would potentially settle permanently. Further to this, man's fear associated with drought (too little water) and floods (too much water) is usually expressed in the interaction with the aquatic environment. In a historical context, since the earliest of times, the Vaal River catchment area has been a prime site of settlement, both for hunters and herders. The local drifts, serving as thoroughfares, formed part of a central network of early strategic communication routes and outspans for the first people of European descent in the trans-Vaal interior. As of 1838 there were pioneer settlements, which were followed by farm occupations and agricultural developments. During the 1890s the Vredefort-Parys area (since ca. 2005 known as the Vredefort Dome) boasted a lively local agriculture-mining boom period. An assessment of European settlement since the 19th century in the Vredefort Dome area indicated that water management has been of prime importance. The historical evidence suggests that potable water, its treatment and the management of waste water, have been important concerns for local residents, especially in times of scarcity (e.g. droughts). As early as the late 19th century, local residents have changed the river's course by means of weirs. They built canals and dams to provide in their demand for water. The town of Parys (est. 1876) dammed the Vaal River, not only for irrigation purposes, but to drive several water mills, and generated power (1917) to supply the town with electric lighting. In this article attention will be given to water management and the fragile position in which local property owners have found themselves since the early 20th century as a result of upstream industrial and sewage pollution.

A multiple case study in the context of clean energy markets in Finland	INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	ISIC - The Information Behaviour Conference	SEP 20-23, 2016	Zadar, CROATIA				PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH	Introduction. This study examines organisational information behaviour in a multi-disciplinary, multi-professional and multi-organisational context. This environment is provided by a project on clean energy and a cloud computing-based market place for electricity trading. The focus is on the interaction and communication involved in creating new, interdisciplinary knowledge. The ultimate aim of our study is to contribute to theoretical understanding of knowledge creation as an aspect of organisational information behaviour, including public engagement in a research and development project, and to present a model of it. In this paper we aim at providing a concise description of our study. The study was commenced in late 2015 and is planned to run until 2021. Method. A descriptive method is applied to outline our multiple case study. The study is based on an interpretative paradigm of organisational studies. Analysis. The research in progress is described. The description further develops the research plan and elaborates on a practice oriented interaction plan and communication agenda of the project as a whole. Results. The context along with the four case studies are outlined, and the methods are described including the ethical concerns. This is to present a model of organisational knowledge creation in a research and development project. Our model may prove to be an alternative to Japanese models on knowledge creation presented in the multidisciplinary field of knowledge management. Conclusion. This study is a part of the BCDC Energy project. The preliminary findings of the study will be reported by the mid-term evaluation in 2017.

Such models are useful for underlying the strategy of the organizations oriented towards achieving their objectives and the requirements of sustainable development. The model that we propose is based on an algorithm of strategic portfolio classification focused on the organization's potential of sustainable development and on the sustainable demand manifested on the market, which provides logic for its application and makes it adaptable to the situations that occur in different sectors. The fact that the analysis of the strategic prescriptions is based on variables which are specific to the classical models of portfolio analysis provides the model with comparability and the transfer of strategic identity in the case of those organizations that aspire to a socio-ecological structure of their activity.

As information and communications technology (ICT) melds with automotive technologies, the rapidly increasing activities of non-practicing entities (NPEs) have caused concern. An NPE is any entity that earns or plans to earn the majority of its revenue from licensing or enforcing its patents. In this study, we analyzed US litigation data on smart car patents to suggest preventive measures that can facilitate strategic decision-making for efficiently confronting NPEs. We performed correlation analysis to identify the factors that relate to disputes against NPEs in the automotive sector. Next, we analyzed the patent acquisitions of NPEs to interpret the characteristic patterns of lawsuits.

An Empirical Study on Emerging Issues and Challenges faced by Middle level HR Practitioners in IT Companies, Karnataka, India	PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES			English	Article						Strategic human resource management; employee engagement; performance management; leadership and development; activities; issues; challenges and career development	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT	Human resource management (HRM) functions are designed to address and fulfil the needs of employees within the company. The function focuses on retaining, maximising the performance of the employee that leads to obtaining the objectives and goals of the company. The HRM acts as a communication platform which connects employees and their employers in order to meet their defined goals within the company. Due to tremendous change in the work environment, the focus of Human Resource (HR) functions has shifted from administration activities to Strategic HRM functions (SHRM). The SHRM acts as a critical success factor for the HR function that helps to identify the required skills and motives which in turn influence key strategic plans and outcome within the company. The role of middle level HR practitioners is changing due to transformation in business needs in the company that helps in formulating and developing HR strategies, policies and procedures that meet the requirements of the company. Various initiatives and engagement activities are carried out by HR practitioners in efforts to reduce the stress level at workplaces which help in motivating and retaining talents within the company. The HR practitioners are specialised in various HR functions such as Human Resource planning (HRP), recruitment and selection, HR information systems (HRIS), employee engagement, leadership and development engagements, career development process, learning and development initiatives, performance management, retention strategies; these are organised within the company. Among the major challenges faced by middle level HR practitioners are: retaining the services of talented workforce, reducing the stress level at workplace, lack of career development opportunities and developing leadership skills for talented employees. This study identifies and also addresses the emerging issues and challenges faced by middle level HR practitioners in their day to day activities in a selected IT firm in Karnataka. Though the study is limited to a particular IT firm in Karnataka, the findings can be generalised to the IT industry in India, other industries in India and overseas to get a fair understanding of the emerging issues and challenges faced by middle level HR Practitioners	[Saravanan, P.; Vasumathi, A.] VIT Univ, VIT Business Sch, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India		Vasumathi, A (corresponding author), VIT Univ, VIT Business Sch, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India.	saravananec@gmail.com; avasumathi@vit.ac.in	P, Saravanan/AAB-8635-2019; /D-6289-2019	/0000-0002-4298-9166			Abraham, 2012, J EC DEV MANAGEMENT, V4, P27; Anoop V., 2012, INT J RES MANAGEMENT, V2, P560; Anyim F.

J	Stening, BW; Zhang, MY				Stening, Bruce W.; Zhang, Marina Y.			Ethics and the liability of foreignness: the case of China	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								It is widely accepted that when firms enter a foreign market, they face considerable challenges and incur additional costs relative to indigenous firms. This liability of foreignness phenomenon is a consequence of many things, not least their lack of familiarity with local cultural norms and values, and economic, political and legal systems that are very different to their own. One especially difficult, but under-explored, issue arises when the host country has ethical and compliance standards that are lower than those in the firms' home country. The dilemma is essentially how to compete successfully with local firms while being ethical and legally compliant at home. This paper uses interviews with Chinese and foreign experts, as well as secondary data, to analyse the challenges facing foreign firms operating in China and to explore the tactical and strategic means by which they can be addressed.

J	Yahanpath, N; Islam, S				Yahanpath, Noel; Islam, Syrus			AN ATTEMPT TO RE-BALANCE THE BALANCED SCORECARD TOWARDS A SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM	ASIA-PACIFIC MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING JOURNAL			English	Article						balanced scorecard; sustainable performance measurement system; risk; sustainable performance; stakeholder; performance risk linkage model; KPI-risk filter	DESIGN; RISK	Despite the use of new performance measurement systems (PMSs), such as Balanced Scorecard (BSC), organisations worldwide have collapsed, leaving few clues before their collapse. So, two questions arise: 'Why does it happen?' and 'How can it be addressed and resolved?' The motivation of this research paper is to address these two questions. The study is a 'multi-case study' comprise of four cases for which the 'documentary review procedure' has been used to analyse data. For the development of the proposed model, this study used 'analytic generalisation' where BSC is used as our initial template. This study found that strong business performance can quickly be negated if the associated risk factors in achieving KPIs are not taken into account explicitly. It is also found that ignoring or paying insufficient attention to all relevant stakeholders in designing PMS makes an organisation more vulnerable to collapse. The basic limitation of case study research is applicable to this study. Further research can be carried out to test empirically the validation of our proposed model in different geographical settings. The study uncovers the underlying weakness of existing PMSs which fall short of meeting the challenges of the 21st century. Based on the balanced scorecard, our proposed Performance-Risk Linkage Model (PRLM) will have the potential to demonstrate a revamped conduit in strategic performance measurement systems, which will enable practitioners to get a competitive edge in managing the performance of complex organisations. This is one of the very few studies that examine the scope of the integration of key risk factors and all relevant stakeholders with performance measurement systems and, to our knowledge, the first of its kind in the Asia-Pacific Region.

We examined the existing enablers and barriers to IPC at a local Community Health Center (CHC) and report on the existing types of IPC practice. We also report how implementing a men-sensitive healthy living programme united a team of health professionals/managers in attending to the needs of a population that to date had been largely underserved. A total of 16 employees were interviewed at the CHC. All respondents spoke positively of existing IPC and provided examples of existing collaborative practices. These CHC professionals (clinicians and managers) experienced greater intra- and extra-organisational collaborations as a result of experiencing a community-delivered programme. It also allowed the CHC professionals/managers to rethink the management and structure of collaborative practices and understand the needs and challenges of working with non-traditional partners (men and workplace-based managers). While our findings are context sensitive (case study design), they shed light on how uniting health professionals/managers around a challenging and non-traditional health issue (i.e., improving health in a hard-to-reach population subgroup) can strategically reduce resistance to collaborative practice development by strengthening team cohesion and fostering innovative interactions.

Using Information Systems to Improve a Mid-Sized Local Health Department's Effectiveness in a Time of Rapid Change	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE			English	Article						electronic health records; informatics capacity; performance management; quality improvement; strategic planning; surveillance	PUBLIC-HEALTH; ACCREDITATION	Background: Informatics capacity building is resource and personnel intensive. Many local health departments (LHDs) face tradeoffs between using their resources to carry out existing mandates and using resources to build their capacity, for example, through informatics, to deliver essential services in a more effective and efficient manner. Objective: The purpose of this case study is to describe how a mid-sized LHD built and used information systems to support its strategic objectives, clinical services, and surveillance. Methods: The mid-sized LHD described here was chosen for its "best practices" in informatics capacity building and use by NACCHO's study advisory committee. To conduct the case study, authors reviewed departmental documents and conducted semistructured interviews with key informants in the agency. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, thematically coded, and analyzed. Results and Conclusions: Findings from the case study suggest that including capacity building in informatics as a strategic priority is one of the most effective ways to ensure that informatics are assessed, updated, and included in resource decisions.

EMPLOYEE FLOURISHING STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							HAPPINESS	This paper produces a preliminary version of a strategic framework for managing employee flourishing. 'Flourishing', a term from positive psychology, describes the experience of 'the good life'. Providing this experience benefits employees. It also motivates them to sustain the enterprise that provides it. This positions employee flourishing as a strategy for long-term enterprise performance, a key concern of industrial engineering. The framework incorporates a systems approach and literature from a variety of bodies of knowledge, including organisational behaviour and human resource management. The framework includes a process, tools, and elements that assist enterprises to manage employee flourishing.	[Stelzner, S. G. E.; Schutte, C. S.

J	Azema, P; Jafari, M				Azema, Pegah; Jafari, Mostafa			THE EFFECT OF DIMENSIONS OF KNOWLEDGE SHARING ON A VARIETY OF STRATEGIC MIND MAP OF MANAGERS AND EMPLOYEES	INDEPENDENT JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & PRODUCTION			English	Article						Mental (intellectual) map; Knowledge sharing; Organizational factors; Personal factors; Knowledge factors		Based on cognitive school of strategic management, the mental (intellectual) map of managers and employees is highly effective on survival and development of their companies .The number of mental maps that managers and employees of a company have on situations and categories (quantity) and the quality (accuracy and precision) of mind maps can be decisive factors in the success of their companies. One of the most important factors affecting the mind map is knowledge sharing. This study seeks to explain the dimensions of this impact. Based on objective, this is a descriptive - explanatory study, while it is an applied one according to the result. It is cross-sectional research based on time, and a surveying according to the methodology. The target population members included the managers and employees of a large industrial complex in the North West of Iran. The sampling method was a stratified randomized approach, and the sample size was calculated using the Cochran formula as 237 subjects. The data were collected by a researcher-made questionnaire containing 36 questions. The results showed that knowledge sharing affects the formation of a strategic map of managers and employees significantly and differently through each of the three categories of organizational factors, personal factors, and knowledge factors. This means that each of these knowledge sharing approaches affects each of the eight mind maps with different quality and quantity. Also, knowledge sharing is not a universal current among all managers and employees; in addition, it is unclear that sharing of knowledge will essentially boost more useful and functional mental maps, and perhaps, it would act otherwise. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct the process of knowledge-sharing to continuously integrate and improve mind maps of decision-takers and decision-makers.

Strategic entrepreneurship is an emerging phenomenon and a factor affecting outputs of companies, and small, medium and large organizations, which is crucial for acquiring long-term sustainable competitive advantage in a wide range and a multilateral interaction of marketing mix factors. The present study is to have an applied investigation and test of strategic entrepreneurship model, by the use of marketing mix elements and the model's role in sustainable competitive advantage. In order to collect data, Delphi method as well as questionnaires has been used, and in order to refine the data, the structural model in the form of confirmatory factor analysis, path analysis and the software of LISREL have been applied. Three main hypotheses have been developed in this study, which are tested using confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis, and all three hypotheses are confirmed. The values of AGFI and GFI indicators are measured 0.91 and 0.95, respectively; and it is found out that competitive advantage factor is more important than other variables.

Comparative study on effect of different embryo culture media on in vitro blastocyst production in goats	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Blastocyst; Caprine; Culture media; in vitro fertilization; Sequential media	MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; CELL-FREE CULTURE; BOVINE EMBRYOS; MATURATION MEDIUM; PORCINE EMBRYOS; CAPRINE OOCYTES; SERUM; COCULTURE; CLEAVAGE; SUPPLEMENTATION	The present study was aimed to assess the efficacy of different culture media for blastocyst development. Oocytes (2,539) from 1,059 ovaries recovered by follicle puncture technique were utilized for present investigation. In experiment 1, effect of different embryo culture media (Gr. 1; mKSOMaa; Gr. 2; TCM-199+OEC; Gr. 3; mSOFaa and Gr. 4; mCR2aa) and in experiment 2, effect of sequential embryo culture medium, Gr. 1: mKSOMaa containing 5% FBS (1-3 days) and 10% FBS (4-10 days); Gr. 2: 0.8% BSA (1-3 days) and continuous embryo culture medium, 10% FBS (4-10 days); Gr. 3: 0.8% BSA (1-10 days) and Gr. 4: 10% FBS (1-10 days) on in vitro blastocyst development potential was evaluated. Significant higher (P<0.05) blastocyst production rate was observed in TCM-199 co-culture with OEC and mKSOMaa medium compared to mSOFaa embryo culture medium. Similarly, significantly higher morula production rate was observed in mKSOMaa medium compared to mSOFaa and mCR2aa medium. However, numerically higher number of embryos cleaved in mSOFaa medium compared to TCM-199 co-culture with OEC. Results indicated that embryos cultured in mKSOMaa, TCM-199+OEC and mCR2aa embryo development media are equally effective in supporting pre-implantation development.While considering the risk factor associated with OEC co-culture, mKSOMaa is proved to be efficient medium for obtaining higher in vitro embryo development rate. In experiment 2, significantly higher morula and blastocyst formation was observed in sequential embryo culture medium compared to BSA supplemented continuous embryo culture medium. Further, the present findings indicated that the use of mKSOMaa+0.8% BSA or 5% FBS for first 3 days of embryo culture resulted in increased rate of blastocyst stage embryos, if initial 3 days of culture in mKSOMaa+0.8% BSA was followed by culture hi mKSOMaa containing 10% FBS. However, no significant difference was observed in sequential embryo culture medium and continuous embryo culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS.	[Goel, Puja; Goel, A. K.; Bhatia, A.

The initiative was undertaken as part of the Indiana Center for Nursing's (ICN) strategic initiative to create the centralized repository for Indiana's nursing workforce data and to ensure a seamless transition of the data to the future national workforce data repository. The infrastructure guidelines were created using recommendations from the Future of Nursing: Campaign for Action, the National Forum of State Nursing Workforce Centers, and the Indiana Board of Nursing. The standardized infrastructure guidelines promote timely and accurate collection, analyses, and reporting from the MDS documents not only regarding nursing supply and education, but also nursing demand, a data set that was not collected by the ICN before this project.

J	Mo, K; Kim, B				Mo, Kyoungwon; Kim, Boyoung			Public Debt Issuance Impact on Management Forecasting Frequency: Evidence from Regulation Fair Disclosure	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES			English	Article						Cost of debt; Debt offering; Management forecasts; Regulation FD; Voluntary disclosure	REGULATION FD; DISCRETIONARY DISCLOSURE; INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS; INFORMATION ASYMMETRY; COST; QUALITY; SOPHISTICATION; ASSOCIATION; OWNERSHIP; ESSAYS	We examine firms' strategic management disclosure policies on debt offerings and their consequences on the cost of debt, considering Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD). We find that firms issue more management disclosures before debt offerings and witness pronounced increases in management forecasting after Regulation FD, suggesting that Regulation FD affects their disclosure policy before debt offerings. Furthermore, firms with high information asymmetry release more management disclosures before debt offerings, and creditors reward increased public disclosures with a lower cost of debt. We believe that this study contributes to the literature on debt offerings and the impact of Regulation FD.

It achieves this through the analysis of various instruments of the EU within the Common Foreign and Security Policy in order to determine how (or if) they influenced Poland's security policy. After the accession to NATO and the EU, Poland could not find its next strategic objective and was gradually losing its position as a leader in the region. Without national interests clearly defined, it is difficult to benefit from the opportunities the EU is presenting to its members, even if these opportunities are limited. The greatest problem is going from one extremum to the other with the shift of power between the two main opposing political parties-Civic Platform and Law and Justice.

Descriptive and quantitative, the sample gathers 150 notes of 76 companies that showed investments in Research and Development (R&D) in 2011 and 2012. The results showed that: (i) innovation in R&D - exploration - is more widespread, but receives less investments in innovation intangible assets (IIA) - exploitation; (ii) the average investment in R&D is higher in larger, regulated and internationalized companies; (iii) the average investment in IIA is higher in internationalized companies.

J	Chang, SC; Chen, IF				Chang, Shao-Chi; Chen, I-Fen			Value added or tunneling? Evidence from new product announcements by Taiwanese business groups	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & ORGANIZATION			English	Article						business groups; network; family control; corporate governance; value-added	CORPORATE EQUITY OWNERSHIP; GROUP-AFFILIATED COMPANIES; EMERGING ECONOMIES; MARKET RELATIONSHIPS; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; GROUP-PERFORMANCE; FAMILY OWNERSHIP; EAST-ASIA; GOVERNANCE; FIRMS	Using new product announcement events made by group member firms in Taiwan, this study examines whether the firms' multiple network ties within business groups benefit member firms or whether they provide a channel for controlling shareholders to tunnel. We find that the announcement of new products by group member firms has a positive effect on the market value of other, non-announcing group peers. This evidence is consistent with the value-added hypothesis. More importantly, this effect is stronger when member firms are connected via equity ties. Furthermore, we also offer an original analysis of how family control in business groups affects the impact of network ties on value creation.

J	Galavan, RJ; Harrington, D; Kelliher, F				Galavan, Robert J.; Harrington, Denis; Kelliher, Felicity			Reconsidering the rigour-relevance gap: the need for contextualised research in risk societies	IRISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						epistemology; management research; mode 2; ontology; rigour-relevance gap; risk society	PRESIDENTIAL-ADDRESS; MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; BUSINESS SCHOOLS; STAKEHOLDERS; LESSONS	This paper addresses the debate on rigour and relevance in management research to identify barriers to progress and identify the challenges and opportunities in moving forward. We identify strong calls from both North American and European literatures for a move to close this gap. It has, however, been 20 years since Hambrick asked scholars 'What if the academy actually mattered?' during his Presidential address to the Academy of Management. Despite both the time and the consistency of calls, there has been only modest progress in closing this rigour-relevance gap. We argue that this is not because of any lack of willingness or capacity but is shaped by systemic issues. We find the narrative of the business school framed as either professional or social sciences a core issue. Each brings with them a tradition of different ontological perspectives and epistemological processes, protected by gatekeepers, which supports, even if unintentionally, the maintenance of the gap. We go on to discuss the challenge of management education and research in a postmodern context, the need to examine our conception of rigour, and to challenge the definition of management as a profession given its strategic win-lose orientation. We conclude with a discussion on the relationship between society and business and lay out the challenges ahead for richly contextualised scholarly work that may be defined as both rigorous and relevant.

While population increase day by day, global resources like oil, fresh water, topsoil and also agricultural products decline so land management is very important for heritage of sustainable planet. The legal expression of farmlands among with operator is land tenure which is a significant component in agricultural land use. Determination of land tenure and the farm size is important for a better understanding of the structure of the agricultural land. Geographical Information Systems emerge that can expressed such as situation. Geographic and non-geographic attributes of spatial datasets enable them to be integrated and analyzed in GIS applications through visualization and analysis tools. The purpose of this paper is evaluate to land tenure and the farm size in provinces of Turkey using GIS. The land operated by size, number, rented land, share basis, their own land of agricultural holdings and land tenure forms analyzed. It is detected the differences among provinces from analyzed results taking everything into account. The results obtained from the study are discussed and suggestions are made.

J	Morozova, EV				Morozova, Elena V.			SEMANTIC MATTER OF "MUSEUM POLICY" AS SCIENTIFIC NOTION	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY			Russian	Article						museum policy; museum marketing; museum management; museum mission; strategic planning		The museology formation as branch of science actualizes its theoretical base including conceptual apparatus. As a result it is necessary to precise terms that were used in scientific literature recently. In this article semantic matter of the term "museum policy" is precised. Analysis of scientific works in English and Russian languages shows that in English language researches different semantic content of scientific notions are corresponded to adequate terms (museum policy, museum politics). At the same time native scientists often see different meanings in the term "museum policy" or use terms which meanings are close in semantic matter to the term " museum policy": cultural museum policy, museum management, museum marketing, strategic planning, museum projecting and planning, the concept of development. In this connection in this paper the comparative analysis of semantic matter of these scientific notions is performed. Museum marketing's gain is to support museum "viability" and its competitive ability among other institutes of entertainment industry. The main task of museum marketing is a research of museum auditorium, its interests and demands. Museum marketing is usually suggested as a part of museum management that is occupied with administration and coordination of functioning of all museum departments. The important part of museum management is to conceive long-term, medium-term and current plans. Strategic planning and strategic administration contain studying of strengths and weaknesses and probable development, searching for new partners, working out and consideration of most profitable for the institute projects. Nevertheless museum is not confined by the institute interests and cultural demands of society but also depends on Culture Legislation - satisfies requirements and a guiding line of the state cultural policy. Museums with their large educational and pedagogic potential must realize their responsibility to society and fulfill their purpose that embodied in the idea of a mission. We suggest that museum mission consists of four main aims: saving cultural heritage, forming cultural identity, forming world view and solving actual problems of local community. Museum mission can be defined as the most important task, the aim of museum as a social and cultural institute. Thus definition " museum policy" contains balanced and considered work of all museum departments (museum management) and its successful functioning in conditions of market economy (museum marketing), realizing responsibility to society (realization of museum mission) and satisfying a guiding line of the state cultural policy.

J	Sioutis, P; Anagnostopoulos, K				Sioutis, Panayiotis; Anagnostopoulos, Konstantinos			Performance Measurement of Technology-Production Base of the Firms: Ascertaining Their Strategic Competitive Advantage	JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY			English	Article						Technology-production base; Non-financial measurements; Strategy-focused manufacturing; Wheel-of-TPB; TPB scorecard	MANUFACTURING STRATEGY; MEASUREMENT SYSTEM	The strategic use of resources and dynamic capabilities that compose the "Technology-Production Base" (TPB) build an absolute strategic advantage for a firm's competitiveness. Thus, the performance measurement of constituents of TPB becomes a key priority to the manufacturing firm. By this consideration, the purpose of this paper is to define a reliable and user-friendly set of measures as key performance indicators (KPIs) that reflects the TPB's constituents and assesses the strategy performance of a manufacturing firm appropriately. The study rests on the novel theoretical model of the firm's TPB established by analysis of its three basic constituents-machinery, human resources, and the interaction relationships of humanware-regarding them as measurable elements. The results from analysis of the firm's TPB are the novel concepts of "Strategy-Focused Manufacturing," "Wheel of TPB Creation," and "TPB Scorecard," which comprises a set of 20 KPIs tested in an initial research project in which were involved three internationally competing manufacturing firms.

J	Ali, A; Nisar, A				Ali, Amanat; Nisar, Asim			Exploration of IT Governance Practices and their Effect on Strategic Projects' Outcomes in Public Sector Organizations of Pakistan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY			English	Article						Critical success factors; IT governance; IT project success; PLS-based structural equation modeling	DESIGN	Most IT initiatives in Public Sector Organizations (PSOs) are undertaken in the form of e-government projects which are usually strategic IT projects. However, many of these projects face the risk of being abandoned, over budgeted and/or unfulfilled promises. Project management principles by default, although supportive, do not guarantee the success of these projects. Strategic IT projects need to be brought within the principles of IT Governance (ITG) for their success. The purpose of this study is to explore ITG practices and their effect on strategic IT projects' implementation success in the PSOs of a less developed country i.e. Pakistan. Mixed research methods have been applied. NVIVO-10 has been applied on qualitative data to analyze various themes and Partial Least Squares (PLS)-based structural equation modeling has been applied on quantitative data to test the proposed model. The findings of the study reveal that the explored practices have small to moderate effect on IT projects' outcomes. The practice "IT/business Communication and Partnership" found to be the most effective whereas the practice, "IT Structures for Responsiveness and Accountability" proved to be the least effective. The study provides important implications for public managers to improve their IT-related plans, optimize limited resources and consequently, improve & sustain public service delivery.

In this study, investigating the accountants working in 109 companies which are based in Istanbul whether they act as passive information providers, or active players in decision-making process, we aim to expose the degree of participation of accountants in strategic management process. We used a survey questioning the accountants' basic duties and responsibilities, knowledge and skills and their ways of participation in decision-making mechanisms on the basis of strategic management process. Also, the degree of participation in strategic management is investigated for different sectors. The survey findings indicate that accountants participate in strategic management process and those working at companies in manufacturing sector participate the most.

Speakers do not only choose linguistic forms, they also choose strategies. This paper intends to explore the ways the language users take to attain their communicate goals, i.e., pragmatic strategies. Specifically, this article aims at a comprehensive positivist of the conversational pragmatic strategies in part of the novel Man, Woman and Child by Erich Segal; the direct-indirect pragmatic strategies in the eighty-nine Coca-Cola consumer advertisements from the year 1886 up to the year 1980; the "conversational maxim" pragmatic strategies in some 793 business letters, the "conversational maxim" pragmatic strategies in seven e-mails; and the "face-management" pragmatic strategies in some 793 business letters. The goal of study is to verify the universality and feasibility of the implementation of pragmatic strategies, both in literary and business writings. Only in this way can the language users achieve their communicative goal effectively.

Online contents by means of mobile phones, primarily smart phones enable the students to keep the learning processes around the clock. The enormous amount of data captured from student's online activities is wasted as traditional learning analytics are not capable of processing them. So in this paper it is proposed to use Big Data technologies and tools into education for capturing learning process of students, strategic operational decisions at institutions. The computing platform and teaching methods to accommodate emerging technologies for related courses are also investigated in this paper. In addition, visualization-based data discovery tools are focused on the front end of big data on helping institutions explore the data more easily and understand it more fully.

Critical theory is the brain child of a group of German social theorists who were associated with the Institute of Social Research in Frankfurt. According to the views that affect critical management, it is inferred that critical thinking is strategic depth in management so that crystallize concepts such as cash, change, dialogue, and freedom in such management. This article seeks to examine the effect of the approach of critical thinking and critical management in organizations. In this article we discussed about the new critical theory. This approach has been proposed in response to the question of postmodernism on critical thinking and to return to the early tradition of the Frankfurt School. The main goal owners to challenge the theory of post-critical attitude postmodern skepticism and cynicism and rediscover the importance and necessity of compliance with the terms and radical thinking. On the other hand, there Take full advantage of dynamic space management is a critical move in the modern era to survive in global competition.

The model prematurely ended in a fiasco that left the community with huge debts and intractable conflicts. This paper aims at understanding the implementation process by taking up the issue of how conflict emerged, resolved and sustained around the SP model. This paper suggests that conflict emerged because of the following reasons: the policy framework failed to address the heterogeneity of the community; community value was undermined as a business partner; and the state placed unprecedented trust, power, and authority on strategic partners.

J	Hamid, S; Mazzuchi, T; Sarkani, S				Hamid, Saheed; Mazzuchi, Thomas; Sarkani, Shahram			Disruption management in the defense ammunition industrial base	SECURITY JOURNAL			English	Article						strategic risk/risk assessment; strategy development; defense supply chain risk management; archival research; case studies	SINGLE	The uniqueness of military supplies and their functions, and the existence of a limited number of producers, makes many Single Points of Failure. A reliable Defense Ammunition Industrial Base (DAIB) is essential to a Department of Defense (DOD) seeking to improve capabilities to fight and prevail in multiple, simultaneous conflicts. This critical aspect of DOD success is poorly addressed in the current DAIB, and threat evaluation methods for what should be a secure supply chain are often inadequate. With replacement alternatives limited, what recourse would the DOD have for acquiring material from one-of-a-kind or limited suppliers should DAIB facilities be destroyed or severely damaged by acts of terrorism or natural or man-made disasters? Ammunition is the lifeblood of the military, and the availability of appropriate types of ammunition in required quantities is essential to combat effectiveness. This article focuses on inherent risks to existing DAIB facilities due primarily to their current locations and vulnerabilities. Within this discussion, several possible solutions arise, with redundant DAIB capabilities being the most viable.

The fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) method is used to identify causal relationships among factors that influence technological innovation, and a FCM structural diagram for evaluating enterprise technological innovation is described. Meanwhile, a fuzzy feedback system for the evaluation of technological innovation, integrated with a nonlinear Hebbian learning algorithm, is established; dependence on expert opinions may be avoided through learning and practice using the cognitive map. Finally, using a computer software platform, a dynamic simulation of any complex index system can be realized. From this simulation, stable conditions can provide path references by which an enterprise engaging in technological innovation can improve the integrative efficiency and the overall effect of any realistic technological innovation activity.

What Ambulatory Care Managers Need to Know About Examination Room Utilization Measurement and Analysis	JOURNAL OF AMBULATORY CARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						ambulatory clinic; capacity planning; examination room; facilities; room utilization		Demand for ambulatory care visits is projected to increase 22% between 2008 and 2025. Given this growth, ambulatory care managers need to proactively plan for efficient use of scarce resources (ie, space, equipment, and staff). One important component of ambulatory care space (the number of examination rooms) is dependent on multiple factors, including variation in demand, hours of operation, scheduling, and staff. The authors (1) outline common data collection methods, (2) highlight analysis and reporting considerations for examination room utilization, and (3) provide a strategic framework for short- and long-term decision making for facility design or renovation.

The models can be used by decision makers in a company to develop a strategy (e.g. marketing, products development) based on the prediction results. We evaluate the model using our datasets of Facebook. We collected the data by utilising Facebook API. Furthermore, we implemented a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) algorithm to the datasets to provide a dynamic prediction of customers' purchase behaviours over time. In the preliminary evaluation, we implemented our model to the datasets with t=2. In our datasets, we found that the category, electronics, was the most favourite topic to discuss, share and like regarding electronics. Interestingly, we found that a positive direction for its trend appeared in the second run of the model.	[Lasmy; Chowanda, A.; Herman, R.

Therefore adaptation of information quality while ensuring information assurance has become a major concern for strategic organizations to upgrade their IT (Information Technology) Assets. The issue exists specifically in organizations with integrated access to distributed data. In this article, a new model is proposed that is derived after addressing issues in already existing information quality and information assurance adaptation models, showing the methodology and its advantages for strategic organizations. However, this model has to be adapted to the requirements and needs of an organization; since it is a reference model. The steps and procedures are identified in quality and assurance adaptation model to bring abstract standard into practice.

Evaluating Emergency Department Asthma Management Practices in Florida Hospitals	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE			English	Article						asthma; best practices; emergency departments; Florida; hospitals		Objective: To assess gaps in emergency department (ED) asthma management at Florida hospitals. Design: Survey instrument with open-and closed-ended questions. Topics included availability of specific asthma management modalities, compliance with national guidelines, employment of specialized asthma care personnel, and efforts toward performance improvement. Setting: Emergency departments at 10 large hospitals in the state of Florida. Participants: Clinical care providers and health administrators from participating hospitals. Main Outcome Measures: Compliance with national asthma care guideline standards, provision of specific recommended treatment modalities and resources, employment of specialized asthma care personnel, and engagement in performance improvement efforts. Results: Our results suggest inconsistency among sampled Florida hospitals' adherence to national standards for treatment of asthma in EDs. Several hospitals were refining their emergency care protocols to incorporate guideline recommendations. Despite a lack of formal ED protocols in some hospitals, adherence to national guidelines for emergency care nonetheless remained robust for patient education and medication prescribing, but it was weaker for formal care planning and medical follow-up. Conclusions: Identified deficiencies in emergency asthma care present a number of opportunities for strategic mitigation of identified gaps. We conclude with suggestions to help Florida hospitals achieve success with ED asthma care reform. Team-based learning activities may offer an optimal strategy for sharing and implementing best practices.	[Nowakowski, Alexandra C.

J	Piiparinen, T				Piiparinen, Touko			Is it time to transcend political realism in the EU-Russia security cooperation? Exploring the critical realist model of emancipatory windows	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						crisis management; critical realism; EU; international relations theory; Russia		This article explores the possibilities of a novel methodological approach in the EU-Russia studies, namely the model of emancipatory windows based on critical realist philosophy. It is argued that the critical realist model can challenge the political realist hypothesis on the absolute gridlock of cooperation between the EU and Russia. The model reveals that collaboration between the two strategic partners is possible within narrow but deep sectors, that is, emancipatory windows, which are defined by three variables: materiality, normativity, and time. In terms of the Third Common Space on external security, an emancipatory window has opened for value-based joint action and operations aimed at the protection of civilians in armed conflicts. More specifically, it would be possible to incorporate and implement the UN-authorised principle of Responsibility to Protect in the road map of the Third Common Space and in the successor to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. The adoption of RtoP could lead to new forms of cooperation between the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and Russia in crisis management, particularly in Africa. Thus, emancipation from the current deadlock in the EU-Russia relations does not necessitate completely new normative or concrete structures, that is, 'reinventing the wheel'. Instead, emancipation can be achieved by modifying and transforming the already existing CSDP-Russia structures.

It is significant as it contributes to the body of knowledge on innovation adoption in e-government and strategic human resource management approaches. The study is based in the Caribbean and provides insights into initiatives that developing countries are implementing within e-government in public organizations. Major findings indicated that there was a complex interaction of technological, organizational and environmental (TOE) factors which interacted. The confluence of factors produced impacts that were variable, dynamic and unpredictable. This approach in the TT public service brought about significant changes in processes and functions within human resource management. Future trends may continue and this study serves to guide policy makers in evaluating and monitoring how adoption policies are framed and future implications that may be learned as a result of this formative HRIS initiative.

With this assessment it will be possible to structure different strategies which enterprises can resort to in order to obtain management advantages. A management model based on selection variables and how restaurants can influence the choice process is proposed in this article. Therefore, it is possible to maximise profit and the number of customers, to increase service quality, to create new services and dishes, to define strategic promotion plans, and to produce effective corrective measures.

Her main symptoms were very limited mobility and depressive symptoms due to the unknown cause of and cure for the illness. Holistic occupational strategies helped the client. stabilize her emotional state, create a safe home environment, improve a communication method, increase physical activity, and promote social participation. Participation in a fall prevention clinical trial lowered her risk of falling; at 9 mo, she reached 75% of the maximum Social Integration score; at 13 mo, she reached near-normal level for activities of daily living (ADLs) and her fastest time for the Timed Up and Go test; and at 2 yr, she achieved a 100% score in instrumental ADLs. For community integration of clients with GBS, a comprehensive strategic self management approach should be prescribed for long-term recovery.

In the first part of our study we summarize the results we obtained by analyzing the corporate governance system in connection with the structure of enterprises and their decision making. Then we have an insight into the leadership style of the suppliers from the point of view of the participation of the staff in decision making. In the second part we analyze the information management of the supplier companies on the basis of the answers from the management. We evaluate the strategic and the operational concept of information management, proceeding from the strategy-making activity. The accomplishment of permanent renewal and willingness to innovate are both indispensable for achieving elasticity in organizations. We explore how the suppliers introduce innovation in connection with the firm structure and the information system. Finally, we consider how some essential company characteristics, namely company size, ownership, region, and the width of the product assortment, affect various company functions.

J	Gerpott, TJ; Neubauer, FB				Gerpott, Torsten J.; Neubauer, Fenna B.			Post-acquisition integration management and takeover performance A comprehensive empirical study of a German transaction from the employee perspective	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article							M-AND-A; CROSS-BORDER ACQUISITION; CULTURAL-DIFFERENCES; SOCIAL SUPPORT; ACQUIRED FIRM; MERGERS; SUCCESS; LEADERSHIP; DYNAMICS; JUSTICE	In spite of a multitude of prior empirical investigations on factors explaining variance in company performance after a takeover each single study has typically incorporated only a narrow range of post-acquisition integration (PAI) design subfields. This paper applies a more comprehensive approach by developing hypotheses with regard to correlations between employee perceptions of six PAI subfields and their assessments of two acquisition performance dimensions. The hypotheses are empirically tested using data obtained in two standardised written employee surveys conducted about one year apart after a horizontal takeover in the information and communication technology industry in Germany. Responses were collected from 570 and 534 employees who worked for the merged organisation. PLS structural equation modeling results show that paths from employee perceptions of the quality of executive leadership in the PAI process, the degree of integration of business processes and corporate cultures as well as adequacy of integration speed to two performance constructs (internal reorganisation success, achievement of strategic objectives) are significantly positive. The results support the view that PAI investigations perform well with attempts combining various lenses of scholarly corporate acquisition research. Implications of the findings are discussed for future studies on PAI measures and for PAI management practice.

We explore how they interact to affect the investment financing of organizational capital (OC). We show that the FT shock level has experienced a dramatic change from being counter-cyclical before 1991 to pro-cyclical after 1991. This structural break alters the OC investment sensitivities during the two sub-periods. We find that the OC investment-cash flow sensitivity is low and the OC investment-q sensitivity is high only when the cost of external capital is low and the FT shock level is simultaneously high. These patterns are mainly driven by financially constrained firms. In addition, our empirical findings suggest that OC investments made during recessions when the FT shock level is also low generate higher productivity than in other conditions.

A MANAGEMENT MODEL FOR BUILDING A COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE CAPABILITY	SAIEE AFRICA RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article						CSIRT; CERT; establishing requirements; building; incident response team; cyber security team; security operations centre; information security capability; management model	SCIENCE RESEARCH; DESIGN SCIENCE; INFORMATION	Although there are numerous guides available for establishing a computer security incident response capability, there appears to be no underlying management model that brings them all together. This paper aims to address the problem by developing a management model for establishing a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). A design science-based approach has been selected for the overall project. However, the current paper reports on the first three activities in design science research: identifying the problem, listing solution objectives, and designing and developing a model. A comprehensive literature review serves two purposes: to confirm the problem and to provide a structured way of revealing the requirement areas. Following the uncovering of the requirement areas, CSIRT business requirements and services are introduced, before exploring the relationships between the areas using argumentation. This culminates in the development of the management model in two parts: a strategic view and a tactical view. The strategic view comprises the business requirements and "higher" level decisions - the environment, constituency and funding considerations - that need to be made when establishing a CSIRT. The tactical view follows by presenting the "how" considerations. Together, these two views provide an holistic model for establishing a CSIRT by parties interested in doing so.

Design/methodology/approach - Relevant literature was reviewed by carrying out a survey based on document analysis involving requirement of models and awards for excellence in management in the following countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. This research study used qualitative data-collecting methods by means of a content analysis technique, carried out between February 2013 and December 2014. The corpus was treated by using a content analysis technique, where categories of analysis were codified based on criteria, items and management process requirements of the models investigated. Findings-The findings show that the mains theoretical knowledge management assumptions are present, in some degree, in models of management excellence in Latin America, but highlight the fact that these models present different structure and maturity levels, some of which combine knowledge management with strategic perspectives and innovation management. Research limitations/implications-The research used qualitative methods of data collection through documentary analysis, conducted 2013 and 2014. As future research agenda, it is recommended to extend the survey to other countries in Latin America. Practical implications - The alignment obtained from the consistency of analysis allowed to find a pattern followed by Latin America countries in the models and management excellence awards. Originality/value - This survey made it possible to produce consistent analyses based on pre-existing models that consider knowledge management as the basis of organization and brought methodological contributions for the management area.

Cold chain management deal with products that should be transported and stored in certain conditions. Monitoring the temperature in cold chain is one of the most critical and important factors. Effective temperature monitoring systems are a must have for a successful cold chain management in companies, so deciding on the best temperature monitoring system is a strategic decision. The aim of this study is to determine the best temperature monitoring system for vaccine storage in a warehouse. While there are many different criteria for selecting among different temperature monitoring systems, a multi criteria decision making methodology is used and we evaluated four different temperature monitoring systems by using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). Fuzzy numbers are used for the application of analytic hierarchy process (AHP), because fuzzy numbers enable the decision makers to deal better with the uncertain and vogue circumstances while selecting the best temperature monitoring systems. Electronic thermometer data logger system, wired data logger temperature monitoring system, wireless data logger temperature monitoring system and cloud-based data logger temperature monitoring system are chosen as alternatives. First, we determined 4 main and 14 sub-criteria that affect the selection process and then we applied fuzzy analytic hierarchy process for selecting the best temperature monitoring system. Cloud-based data logger temperature monitoring system is determined as the best alternative.

Following the 1988World Health Assembly resolution to eradicate polio, the government of Nigeria, with support from partners, has been implementing several rounds of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) each year. In addition to the technical requirements, the success of the polio eradication initiative depends on timely provision of adequate financial resources. Disbursement of funds for SIAs and payment of allowances to numerous vaccination personnel at the grassroots level are enormous operational challenges in a country the size of Nigeria. Upon donors' request for a transparent and effective payment mechanism, the World Health Organization (WHO), in consultation with national counterparts, created the innovative direct disbursement mechanism (DDM) in 2004. The objective of the DDM was to timely deploy operational funds at the field level and directly pay vaccination personnel allowances at the grassroots level. Methods.aEuro integral A detailed operational guideline for funds disbursement was developed in close consultation with central and field stakeholders. Multiyear financial resource requirements and operational budgets for every campaign were produced by an interagency-coordinated finance subcommittee. The WHO engaged a bank and an accounting firm as DDM partners to support disbursement of and accounting for the SIA funds, respectively. The 37 WHO field offices were equipped with electronic financial systems to support the DDM process, and temporary payment sites were set up to facilitate payment to vaccination personnel at the grassroots level. Coordination meetings among DDM partners were held regularly to reconcile financial records and address operational challenges. Results.aEuro integral Between 2004 and 2014, DDM supported 99 polio and nonpolio vaccination campaigns, disbursing more than $370 million to about 16 million beneficiaries across 280 temporary payment sites. To mitigate security risks and reduce operational costs, the WHO and DDM partners introduced mobile payment to vaccination personnel in May 2015 in compliance with national regulations. A total of 97% of the targeted 1871 beneficiaries in 2 pilot sites were successfully paid through mobile payment, although some challenges remain to be addressed. Discussion.aEuro integral The DDM has met its objectives with a high rate of financial accountability and transparency, despite persistent operational and security challenges. With support from Nigeria, the Pakistan polio vaccination program successfully adopted the DDM. The DDM continues to play an important role in effective implementation of the polio endgame strategy and the national immunization strategic plan. As part of polio legacy planning, we recommend the DDM as a model for other opportunities that involve the engagement of large field-level teams as new vaccines are introduced in Nigeria and elsewhere.

The analysis of specialists' opinion on the implementation of concept of risk management in clinical trials of drugs	ZAPOROZHYE MEDICAL JOURNAL			Russian	Article						Clinical Trials; Drug Evaluation; Risk Assessment; 4-drugs; Investigational		At the modern stage of the pharmaceutical industry development quality risk management becomes an integral part of all the processes of drug development and clinical trials (CT). Aim of paper is to study the opinion of competent experts in the field of CT of drugs and formation of strategic ways of risk management at the clinical site as well as to identify possible complications in the practical implementation of these approaches. Materials and methods: the survey of the expert group (17 people) to select the indicators and the parameters measuring the risks of CT at clinical site, as well as their acceptable levels. The assessment of survey results was done using non-parametric statistics methods. Results of research. There were established the differences of various stakeholders' notion of conceptual content and practical importance of quality management and the application of risk-oriented approaches at the clinical site in relation to CT quality that can become an obstacle to their implementation. The introduction of risk-based monitoring into the system for CT management at the clinical site corresponds to the interests of all stakeholders involved in the study. General concernment of the customer's representatives, regulatory authority and researchers should be an important basis for the implementation of the risk-based management at the clinical site. So, it is necessary to create a common understanding of the terminology, objectives and expected outcomes of risk management at the clinical site, as well as a clear allocation of the duties and responsibilities of each side. Conclusions. The expediency of the concept of risk management application at the clinical site, practical orientation, as well as the need to develop scientific and methodological approaches for its implementation, contributing to the formation of a common basis for action and coordinated interaction of stakeholders involved in the management of CT were proved.

Recommendations were made to improve safety and prevent possible hazards, taking into account several years of production experiences, past maintenances and reported accidents and near misses. Implicating safety improvements by adopting recommendation yielded from HAZOP studies is expected to reduce system risks and enhance its reliability. The main process hazards identified include water flow fluctuation, pump failures and excess pressure leading to pipe failures, condensation at compensating steam outlets, leakage, substandard maintenance practices, deviations in control of pH, oxygen content, corrosion, condensed water entrapment, were identified as some of the major sources of risks involved. These were considered in constitution of the risk matrix, from which main recommendations and execution time needed are produced. Using the available techniques and standards as well as installing flow control devices could ensure maintaining a normal operating pressure which will in turn, reduce pump stoppage and the unit being out of service due to water shortage. Starting-up procedure for the unit was also revised based on the results of this study. The need for regular (annual) inspection of instrumentation controls especially solenoids and check valves were also emphasized. To avoid reverse flow of water into the boilers, installation of a check valve before HV 213 was recommended.	[Aziznezhad, Vahid; Rezaei, Kaveh; Chenani, Ali; Mozdianfard, M.

In this study a three dimensional; namely information, transactional and strategic decision making perspectives of the e-procurement functionalities are investigated. A cross-sectional survey is used as the methodology for the data collection. After a systematic analysis it was found that in the MRO industry the MSEMs used the e-procurement system mainly for purchasing, communication and transactional purposes. However, strategic utilisation of the e-procurement for the optimisation of SCM process in the MRO industry in India is still in its nascent stage. The results are limited to its sample size due to the size of the MRO and its MSEMs industry. Thereafter, success factors and performance of the e-procurement in these MSEMs is also studied to analyse the utilisation of e-procurement in detail.

J	Johnson, IM				Johnson, Ian M.			International Assistance and National and Individual Contributions in the Development of Education for Library, Information and Archival Studies: Some Evidence from a Case Study	LIBRI-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION STUDIES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Satellite Meeting on Towards Harmonization of LIS Education in Developing Countries - Strategy and Leadership	AUG 12, 2015	Univ Cape Town, Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA		Univ Cape Town	international agencies; technical assistance; education for library; information and archival studies; leadership; politics; Iraq		This is a very brief summary of a study that focused on the development of education for library, archive, and information services (LIS) in Iraq, where significant progress seemed to have been made before the Second Gulf War, despite the country's increasing economic problems and political isolation in the last decades of the twentieth century. It drew evidence from the published literature, previously unexplored archival material, and discussions with some of the participants. The study examined professional education for librarianship, documentation, information and archives work against the background not only of the evolution of LIS, but also in the broader context of the country's national, economic, and social development. It examined trends in international assistance for library development, and briefly reviewed parallel developments in other Arab countries to provide a benchmark. Based on this wide ranging examination, it drew some tentative conclusions about the issues that fostered the development of LIS education in Iraq, including: the attitude of government and university officials; the organisation and allocation of state finance; the development of literacy and the education system; the duration and nature of external support; the activities of foreign experts; the development of the cadre of teachers of LIS; the role played by advocacy and opportunism. The study also identified a number of factors that have held back development, including: the pressures on the state budget; the absence of a comprehensive government strategic plan to develop a culture of reading and independent learning; and a lack of flexibility in the management of the state education system. An understanding of these factors, and the approach to identifying them, may contribute to strengthening the foundations of LIS education in both developing countries and those that have an established infrastructure.

This study focuses on small- and medium-sized technology-based firms in Sweden that employ between 1 and 500 employees and that could be potential suppliers of hybrid electric vehicle technology. The empirical data were collected using a survey (questionnaire) and it covers 40 technology-based firms in eight industrial branches in Sweden. We have included 18 variables in order to identify critical resources regarding Business and R&D networks in three dimensions: ideas and advice, production, and R&D. Two regression models developed for battery systems and battery cells have significant findings. Networks with universities and consultants are especially important. One operative way is building strategic alliances with other firms. The main contributions of this study are empirical support that network resources are necessary and important in battery systems and battery cells and, more broadly, networks are necessary systems for technology shifts in the hybrid electric vehicle industry.

More recently, there has been an enormous enhancement of computing power and internet bandwidth, coinciding with a proliferation of web-based technologies. This has opened up new opportunities in terms of using complex modelling for flood forecasting and communicating the projections. However, a literature review shows that many of the contemporary DSS in the field of flood emergency management employ surrogate or simplified flood modelling systems. The reason is that undertaking complex flood simulation models has been considered as infeasible in the short time available during a flood emergency. This paper challenges that paradigm. The desire for this paradigm shift is underpinned by the recent advent of Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) flood modelling systems and sophisticated web-based GIS systems that can better present the results of these models. Furthermore, it is proposed that there should be a move away from model-based systems to open systems that can house modelling engines and communicate the outputs effectively for decision-makers. This approach promotes user-focused communities that can cross agency and proprietary lines and reduce costs and promote the maintenance of developed systems. Emergency management decision-making is usually threshold based, and accordingly, outputs should be produced that facilitate this type of decision-making. This paper describes the framework and the working prototype of a flood emergency decision support system (as a proof of concept) that is in operation and supports tactical and strategic decision-making during flooding on the Gold Coast.

J	Mourtos, I				Mourtos, Ioannis			Cardinality constraints and systems of restricted representatives	JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						Global cardinality constraint; Polyhedral combinatorics; Constraint programming	SATISFACTION; CONSISTENCY	Cardinality constraints have received considerable attention from the Constraint Programming community as (so-called) global constraints that appear in the formulation of several real-life problems, while also having an interesting combinatorial structure. After discussing the relation of cardinality constraints with well-known combinatorial problems (e.g., systems of restricted representatives), we study the polytope defined by the convex hull of vectors satisfying two such constraints, in the case where all variables share a common domain. We provide families of facet-defining inequalities that are polytime separable, together with a condition for when these families of inequalities define a convex hull relaxation. Our results also hold for the case of a single such constraint.

AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF INDIAN COMPANIES	JIMS8M-THE JOURNAL OF INDIAN MANAGEMENT & STRATEGY			English	Article						Environmental Policies; Strategic planning; Environmental Performance; Financial Performance	PERFORMANCE	Less polluting firms that employ green processes and follow better environmental policies have become preferred mode of investment asset class. The concern of businesses on environment is continuously being reflected in the long term focus and strategic planning. The primary aim of the present paper is to examine the relationship between environmental performance and financial performance of Indian companies that have been rated under Green Rating Project of Centre for Science and Environment from FY 2011 to FY 2015. The environmental performance is measured in terms of the ratings provided under the Green Rating Project while the financial performance is measured in terms of net profit margin. Regression analysis is performed on the data and the results show that higher score on the green index has a positive effect on financial performance for automobile and caustic chlorine and cement sectors. Also the firm's sensitivity towards the environment leads to better management of costs and lower monitoring costs, thereby increasing profits.

Theory suggests that telling lies in these environments may be strategically optimal if there exists a small difference in monetary incentives. We design a laboratory experiment to investigate whether agents with different monetary incentives in a network environment lie to each other. We found that most communication within an incentive group is truthful and deception often occurs between subjects from different groups. These results align with the prediction of the existing theory. Our findings have important implications for intraorganizational conflict management, demonstrating that in order to minimize deceptive communication between departments the firm may need to reduce incentive differences between these groups.

A case study approach involving four R and D organisations in Nigeria was used. A total of 213 questionnaires were retrieved and these were analysed using quantitative research software, SPSS version 21. The results revealed that 95 per cent of respondents acknowledged that projects executed by public research organisations were planned, but the conventional project management practices were used instead of strategic project management (SPM) principles. In addition, it was found that the level of implementation of the project management practices were also inadequately implemented as such affected the organisation's performance adversely. As established in this study, the concept of strategy is changing and to address the factors that affect research and development project implementation, senior project practitioners need to pay more attention to strategic, operational and project risks.

On the construction of vertically integrated media concerns in a sport-media conglomerate	GERMAN JOURNAL OF EXERCISE AND SPORT RESEARCH			German	Article						Resource theory; Network theories; Mass communication; Competence approaches; Product development		On the basis of the media coverage of the Olympic Games and the underlying strategic positioning, it is shown how important it is to illuminate this topic from an interdisciplinary perspective. Special emphasis is placed on the coupling of resource-based theory and network theories and illustrates particularly well the new interplay between management, organizational communication and mass communication. In the past decade the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has been transformed in ever increasing dimensions into a media corporation. The Olympic values and principles, innovations and creation potentials are the focal points of this strategy as tangible assets of the media.

It is shown that the problems of regulating aircraft operation in the airspace can be posed as the control of queues with safety separation-dependent service rate. Regarding the single aircraft as a batch, the relationships between input variables, state variables and output variable are established based on jet routes conflict point competition mechanism and space spatial configuration of jet routes. Furthermore, from the spatial logic configuration of sub-models, the whole airspace multi-aircraft max-algebra coupled models and conflict pre-deployment models are also presented. This paper uses the proposed framework to develop optimization cost functions that help prepare the airspace for various regulation needs. In particular, the model includes the management of airport or waypoint arrivals and departures subject to internal restraint mechanism which are very useful for 4D-trajectory based aircraft operation.

J	Huvila, I				Huvila, Isto			Change and stability in archives, libraries and museums: mapping professional experiences in Sweden	INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL			English	Article							MANAGEMENT; RECORDS; AGE	Introduction. One of the most prominent topics of professional and academic archives, libraries and museums related literature revolves around the questions of change and continuity of the institutions. The aim of the study is to find how professionals conceptualise factors that contribute to continuity and change at their institutions. Method. The analysis is based on a qualitative analysis of 131 open-ended questions included in a Web survey of Swedish professionals conducted in February-March 2011. Analysis. The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results. Borrowing from Lewin's field theory and its derivative, force-field analysis, the professional articulations of the strengths and future prospects of their institutions are interpreted in terms of strategic forces that influence change and stability at archives, libraries and museums. The study shows that the forces that impede and catalyse change are overlapping to a significant degree that indicates the possibility of disparate alternative strategy formulations for the institutions. Conclusions. More focus on defining the ownership of the strategic goals at archives, libraries and museums and defining the operating space and core domains of the organizations is essential for formulating their future strategies.

J	MacLean, K				MacLean, Ken			Humanitarian mine action in Myanmar and the reterritorialization of risk	FOCAAL-JOURNAL OF GLOBAL AND HISTORICAL ANTHROPOLOGY			English	Article						Burma; conflict; humanitarianism; landmines; Myanmar; risk		This article examines current debates for and against Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) in Myanmar. The analysis, based on interviews with key local, national, and international actors involved in HMA, reveals why so many of them regard the mapping and removal of "nuisance" landmines as posing a security threat to the peace process. (Landmines deny people access to territory; when conflict ends, these landmines no longer serve a strategic purpose and thus become a dangerous nuisance.) These same debates also shed light on the growing role risk management approaches now take in Myanmar as a response to decades of authoritarian misrule by a succession of military regimes. The landmines, although buried in the ground, actively unsettle such good governance initiatives and the neoliberal development projects to which they are oft en linked, most oft en by reterritorializing military, humanitarian, political, and economic authority in overlapping and conflicting ways at multiple scales. The findings reveal why HMA actors resist labeling the crisis landmine contamination poses to civilians as a "crisis" that requires immediate humanitarian action.				kmaclean@clarku.edu					[Anonymous], 2015, UNCHR COUNTR OP PROF; Bennett J., 2010, VIBRANT MATTER; Brown Michael, 2014, DAWPUWAE KAREN MININ; Displacement Solutions (DS), 2014, LAND RIGHTS MIN ACT; Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GIHCD), 2005, STUD MAN MIN CLEAR R; GICHD, 2014, GUID MIN ACT; [GICHD UNMAS], 2013, GUID TRANS MIN ACT P; Hiltgartner Stephen, 1992, ORG UNCERTAINTIES RI, P38; International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), 2013, LANDM MON 2013; Karen Peace Support Network, 2014, CRIT JAP INT COOP AG; Latour Bruno, 1990, REPRESENTATION SCI P, P18; Lone Wa, 2013, MYANMAR WORLDS 3 WOR; Mather C, 2002, ENVIRON PLANN A, V34, P239, DOI 10.1068/a3374; Mbembe Achille, 2001, POSTCOLONY; Ministry of Border Aff airs and Japan International Cooperation Agency, 2013, PREP SURV INT REG DE; Moo Saw Greh, 2013, KAREN NEWS      0718; Myanmar Peace Center, 2013, MYANM MIN ACT STAND; Myanmar Peace Monitor (MPM), 2014, DEC MYANM PEAC PROC; Norwegian Peoples Aid (NPA), 2013, NPA SIGNS AGR EU MIN; POWER M., 2007, ORG UNCERTAINTY DESI; Power M., 1997, AUDIT SOC RITUALS VE; Roitman Janet., 2014, ANTICRISIS; Rutherford K.

The effective use of financial variables and subsequently performance evaluation of hospitals would help to facilitate the continuation of activities which provides the ground for the economic administration of hospital industry. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the viewpoints of executive administrators of hospitals in Iran to evaluate the feasibility of using financial variables of health in hospitals. Material and Methods: The present study was an applied research which is conducted using AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) technique. After extracting the evaluation variables, the financial performance of hospitals was evaluated using the questionnaire which was confirmed by Cronbach's Alpha equal to 0.85. Moreover, the group of experts in this study included 62 Iranian hospital administrators. Results: Global indices for the economic evaluation of hospitals were identified which were categorized into 9 domains/factors using AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process); furthermore, they were prioritized regarding the importance and feasibility in hospitals. Conclusion: Utilizing financial variables in evaluating the economic performance of hospitals can determine their economic growth. Moreover, analysis of the current status of hospitals can be used to make strategic decisions and provides a basis for comparisons between hospitals and their rankings.

J	Nduwimfura, P; Zheng, JG				Nduwimfura, Philbert; Zheng, Jianguo			A comparative analysis of IT outsourcing readiness in the East African community	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Developing countries; East African Community; IT outsourcing; Offshoring; PROMETHEE	TRANSACTION COST; SUCCESS; REASONS	Developing countries are increasingly relying on Information and Communication Technology (ICTs) for their socio-economic development. Many countries have achieved faster gross domestic product (GDP) growth through information technology (IT) outsourcing, which is now largely recognized as a strategic management practice that can provide a competitive advantage in business. The East African Community (EAC) member states are putting in place policies to help improve their overall ICT environment competitiveness. This paper evaluates the current state of IT outsourcing readiness in the EAC countries, and contributes to the outsourcing body of knowledge by establishing a relation between a country's Networked Readiness Index (NRI) and its readiness for IT outsourcing. This evaluation is performed based on the PROMETHEE method which is very effective at dealing with multi-criteria decision making problems. The results show that Kenya is the most ready country for IT outsourcing in EAC, followed by Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, and Burundi.

One of the important influences on strategic objectives is the attitudes and perceptions of strategic planners groups. This paper focuses on conception of strategic directions in Export Development Bank of Iran (EDBI) among administrators (including board members, top and middle managers). This study was designed to illustrate how Q methodology can be used as a tool for strategic planning. Potential plans for the future of EDBI were formulated and Q sorted by 20 members of EDBI to determine support or resistance of them. The results show that these stakeholders have three distinct conceptions about strategic direction which are based on how they perceive these strategic themes. The author labeled these conceptions as: intellectual capital developers, external environmental scanners and budget supervisors.

J	Parsai, A; Rokade, V				Parsai, Abhishek; Rokade, Varsha			Study of national rural drinking water programme implementation during last five years (from FY 2010-2011 to 2014-2015) in state of Madhya Pradesh, India	JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						LPCD; NRDWP; piped water supply schemes; service delivery; strategic plan		The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (MDWS), Government of India is entrusted with the responsibility for providing financial and technical resources for ensuring safe and sufficient drinking water in rural habitations of India. As per data available on the online portal of MDWS regarding progress of the National Rural DrinkingWater Programme (NRDWP), out of a total 1,696,664 habitations nationwide, 1,249,695 (73.65%) habitations have been provided with a minimum of 40 litres per capita per day of water supply. Only 40.14% of the total habitations nationwide are provided with piped water supply schemes (PWSSs), and the remaining 59.86% of habitations have hand pumps and other schemes, whereas in the case of Madhya Pradesh, these figures are 15.96% and 84.04%, respectively. With the present rate of habitation coverage and quality of programme implementation, it seems almost impossible to reach the targets set in the 'Strategic Plan for the rural drinking water sector for the period 2011 to 2022'. This study presents the findings of a state wide quantitative assessment of NRDWP implementation during the last five financial years (2010-2011 to 2014-2015) and also qualitative assessment of 16 PWSSs in 4 selected districts.

J	Pauceanu, AM; Hammouri, MS				Pauceanu, Alexandrina Maria; Hammouri, Mohammad Salim			Strategic Energy Management in Sultanate of Oman	MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS			English	Article						Energy; Energy management; Sultanate of Oman; GCC; Energy policies; Energy challenges		Various economic sectors have set up a competition against themselves in the developing world which calls for an overwhelming need for energy sources that are reliable enough. It is important to have efficient energy supply for a smooth economic running. There is a high endowment of resources of oil in the Middle East that creates an equal determination to provide the proper management of the resources. Managing energy can only be done when there are a business culture and the environment that enables it. As far as information and technology is concerned, there is a new dimension that has been acquired in the relationship that exists between the mining industry and the sectors of renewable energy. Having drawn efforts from different corners of the globe, the primary focus has been put on the Gulf region known for the greatest supply of fossil energy. Oman leads the Gulf area as a gate pass that is strategic enough to get into the Arabian Gulf. This area has shown complete passion about the pertinence of necessary steps early enough that will lead to attaining sources of renewable energy that are more reliable. All discussion areas have an aim which is to show how determined the Gulf Cooperation Council is, emphasising more on Oman, in the bid to obtain more alternative sources of renewable energy that are reliable.

J	Perry, JT; Hanke, RH; Chandler, GN; Markova, G				Perry, John T.; Hanke, Ralph H.; Chandler, Gaylen N.; Markova, Gergana			Some Predictors of Entrepreneurship Article Impact	JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP			English	Article						bibliometric study; article impact; field development; paradigm development; scholarly research	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; CITATIONS; KNOWLEDGE	We study scholarly impact in the entrepreneurship field. To answer the question of which factors predict impact, we focus on understanding how article citation behaviour has changed over 20 years. We apply paradigm development theory and framing concepts to guide our study. We find that the value attached to both an article and the article's authors has become a greater predictor of article citations over time. Additionally, we find that whether authors' claim that their articles present interesting or useful ideas predicts article impact. But the nature of the impact differs depending on the type of the claim. The pattern of results suggests that entrepreneurship research may currently be at an intermediate stage of development.

We show that ex-post knowledge in these papers can be expressed by ex-ante knowledge and therefore epistemically, time is irrelevant to the analysis. Furthermore, we show that material rationality by weak dominance and by expectation can be expressed in terms of the timeless strategic form of the game.

J	Vnouckova, L; Urbancova, H; Smolova, H				Vnouckova, Lucie; Urbancova, Hana; Smolova, Helena			Approaches to the talent management agenda in forestry companies	CENTRAL EUROPEAN FORESTRY JOURNAL			English	Article						Development; perception; employee; forestry; education	MOBILITY; MODEL	Professional literature and practice started to focus intensively on the field of talent management. A lack of talented individuals occurred in all sectors worldwide. The war for talents has not faded out, on the contrary, it has been intensifying. The aim of the paper is therefore to analyse the perception of opportunities for development and management of talents in forestry and to specify characteristics of employee/talent support perception in surveyed companies. The analysis is based on a primary survey conducted in 101 forestry companies. The data were obtained through surveys in which one manager and one employee represented a single company. One-dimensional and multidimensional statistics were used to evaluate the data. The results showed that employees perceived developmental conditions in companies more positively than what was stated by managers and company representatives. The average difference in the perception was 8.5%; employees perceived the conditions better than company representatives. When negative phenomena were analysed, the perception was quite opposite. The average difference was 9.5%. The limit of the paper is the narrow focus on primary sector companies. The results may help surveyed companies in the primary sector to encourage managers and employees to participate in developmental programmes as their own initiative and willingness to take part in education and developmental activities was found.

J	Zhang, XM; Liu, N; Wang, Y				Zhang, Xiaomei; Liu, Na; Wang, Yang			Research on Stability of Strategic Alliance in Heilongjiang Soybean Processing Industry: an Empirical Study based on AHP and FCE Method	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SECURITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Soybean processing industry; Strategic alliance; Stability; Influence factor; AHP method		In recent years, as the economic continuous development, market competition has been dramatically increasing. In order to maintain competition advantage, enterprises have to seek for more cooperation. As a new model of cooperation, industry strategic alliance is a significant method for cooperation to get competitive advantage, also increasing the rate of innovation. However, due to a variety of factors, part of the alliance is not stable, failure rate is very high. Heilongjiang province soybean processing industry strategic alliance as one of the best agricultural strategic alliance in China, it is also disturbed by it. In order to ensure the healthy and stable development of the alliance, in this paper, we will draw on relevant literature and expert advice, also field visits to the alliance, finding out the factors affecting the stability of the alliance. Then, AHP and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method are combined to identify high impact factors, and puts forward specific comments based on the factors identified, thereby enhancing the long-term stable development of the alliance. At the same time, it also laid the foundation for the healthy development of other alliances.

B.; Deleito, Javier Moraleda; Xu, Yanmin; Ray, Jaydip			Developing a one-stop tinnitus service: outcomes of a joined up management strategy: a retrospective observational cohort study	JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article						good practice guidelines; imaging; outcomes; tinnitus		Rationale, aims and objectivesThe pressure to deliver quality care with finite resources means that dealing with single-symptom conditions like tinnitus in an efficient and individualized manner has never been more important. Both primary and secondary care practitioners have an obligation to explore efficient delivery of simple management pathways. Commissioners of health care are in a unique position to affect evidence-based strategic change in the management of uncomplicated tinnitus. This study is an attempt to explore one such option. We present the outcomes of a tinnitus patient pathway designed for one-stop management, thereby minimizing unnecessary additional appointments. MethodA retrospective observational cohort study of 452 patients referred to a NHS one-stop tinnitus clinic from 2008 to 2012. Clinical care guided was through the use of a structured approach to history taking, neurotological examination and management. Results294 out of 452 (65%) of patients referred had unilateral tinnitus. The most common associated complaints were hearing loss (387/452, 86%) and hyperacusis (329/452, 73%). 210 (46%) of patients had their presenting complaint dealt with in a single clinic visit. ConclusionA structured system for referral and management of tinnitus within the health system ensures patients have timely access to evidence-based investigation and treatment. A consistent approach to imaging aimed at identifying retrocochlear pathology can benefit patients through early diagnosis of central pathology and the reassurance provided by a negative scan.

J	Gilbert, L				Gilbert, Leah			"Pharmacists have been left out of the loop': exploring the role of pharmacists in the management of HIV/AIDS in South Africa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACY PRACTICE			English	Article						community pharmacy; pharmaceutical public health; professional practice; research method; sociology	CARE	ObjectiveThe aim of this paper is to portray and critically analyse the role played by pharmacists in the management of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa. MethodsThe data used for this article originate in secondary and primary sources. They were collected by means of a documentary analysis of all relevant documents of significance as well as exploratory telephone interviews conducted with a systematic random sample of community pharmacies in Greater Johannesburg in 2004 and 2010. Key findingsIt is clear from the original strategic framework that the government envisaged pharmacists playing a significant role in the various facets of the epidemic. Following these intentions, the South African Pharmacy Council and the Pharmaceutical Society of South Africa embarked on a process of establishing AIDS Resource Centres in pharmacies. However, although in some areas pharmacists are contributing to the management of HIV/AIDS, the overall scenario revealed is that of lack of willingness to go for additional training and/or to invest in restructuring the pharmacy to accommodate' the activities of an AIDS Resource Centre' without the prospects of adequate financial gains. In a parallel process, the original, more meaningful role for pharmacists in the management of HIV/AIDS has not been featured in recent professional and governmental documentation. ConclusionThe reality on the ground is that of a missed opportunity as the pharmacists have not risen to the challenge and they remain on the margins, and not at the centre, of those professionals managing HIV/AIDS in South Africa.

J	Kehrel, U; Klischan, K; Sick, N				Kehrel, Uwe; Klischan, Kai; Sick, Nathalie			Why Research Partnerships Fail in the Biotechnology Sector - An Empirical Analysis of Strategic Partnerships	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Biotechnology; research collaboration; strategic partnership; technology alliances; technology collaboration	ALLIANCE SUCCESS; PERFORMANCE; COOPERATION; RESOURCE; COMPLEMENTARITY; CAPABILITIES; COMPETITION; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; STABILITY	Over half of all research-oriented partnerships in the biotechnology industry fail due to problems in inter-organizational relationships. The analysis of factors that determine the success of strategic partnerships can help companies to reduce the high failure rates. Based on the resource-oriented and relationship-oriented approach, this study examines the influence of three structural factors and three dynamic factors on the success of strategic, research-oriented partnerships in the biotechnology industry. In the empirical study, data of 48 research collaborations by 28 companies were collected and analyzed. The results confirm the significant influence of the factors "complementary resources", "operational compatibility", "bilateral exchange of information" and "opportunistic behavior". On the basis of these findings, companies can find approaches to influence the success of their own research collaborations.

J	White, SJ; Minick, P				White, Sharon Jackson; Minick, Ptlene			The Perceptions of Non-Palliative Care Hospitalist Physicians Referring Patients to a Hospital Palliative Care Program	JOURNAL OF HOSPICE & PALLIATIVE NURSING			English	Article						hospitalist; palliative care; perceptions; phenomenology; referral		Many hospitalized patients need holistic care, symptom management, advanced care planning, stronger patient-family-provider communication, strategic goals-of-care planning, and improved coordination of care. These services are provided by palliative care teams. Hospitalist physicians are responsible for the oversight of most hospitalized patients and for referring patients to palliative care when needed. Little is known about hospitalist physicians' perceptions of palliative care services. A qualitative study using an interpretative phenomenological research design was conducted. Six hospitalist physicians were recruited using purposive sampling. Questions focused on assessing their experiences, facilitators, and barriers related to palliative care referrals. Their responses were transcribed and underwent thematic analysis. The findings were as follows: (a) theme 1: when hospitalist physicians want help (subthemes of when they cannot do any more/renegotiating goals of care, need of time to listen, and pain management) and (b) theme 2: barriers to referral (subthemes of family refusal, oncologists, and meaning of palliative). The study participants sought palliative care when they needed goals of care clarified, more time for listening to patients and families, and pain management. Barriers to palliative care included biases that some patients' families and other physicians may have about the goals and meaning of palliative care.

In this research, we compared this relationship for two commercially important and sympatric species, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). At locations in eastern Canada, 57 black and 50 white spruce trees were destructively sampled to obtain foliage biomass, crown structure, and tree stem measures. Using a model-based approach, we compared foliage biomass-branch basal area and foliage biomass-sapwood relationships at the tree and disk (i.e. along the tree stem) levels (i.e. pipe-model ratios) between these two species. We found that (i) branch foliage biomass-branch basal area was greater for black spruce than white spruce and (ii) pipe-model ratios along the tree stem given tree size were greater for black spruce than for white spruce. We attributed these differences to: (i) greater shade tolerance and leaf longevity of black spruce; (ii) slower growth rates of black spruce; and (iii) differing hydraulic strategies and mechanical requirements.

J	Ahmady, S; Tatari, F; Yazdani, S; Hosseini, SA				Ahmady, Soleiman; Tatari, Farin; Yazdani, Shahram; Hosseini, Seyed Ali			A Comprehensive Approach in Recruitment and Employment Policies for Faculty Members: A Critical Review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH & HEALTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Recruitment; Employment; Policy; Faculty member; Critical review		Experts in the field of human resource management have always emphasized on human work force as the most important strategic factor and the organization's most valuable asset and believe that effective management of human resources is the key to organizational success. Recruitment and selection are one of the aspects of human resource management that are of great importance and adopting appropriate policies in this area could provide the appropriate use of human resources. In universities and higher education institutions, faculty members are one of the major capitals and development and application of appropriate policies play a major role in their success. This study is based on critical review where relevant search terms were used to collect the studies using extensive and structured search of the databases. One hundred fifty titles were retrieved. Then, with purposive sampling, texts screening was conducted in three stages: A) primary screening or title screening on the grounds that are associated with managing recruiting faculty members, B) secondary screening performed based on study summary and introduction texts, and C) tertiary screening: the texts were briefly studied and the texts were prioritized based on conceptual richness and related to contextual studies and irrelevant articles were excluded. Complete and in-depth study of the richest papers began. Forty-five articles and text were examined. The results suggest that in most universities management of recruiting faculty members is decentralized and based on the department. Findings show that policies such as reducing the use of tenure track, the long-term contracts, limiting the tenure to faculty of science, limiting tenure to higher levels of associate professor and design the diverse career paths and different forms of employment are of the policies that can be considered by university managers. The findings also suggest that universities can use flexible policies, such as increasing pre-tenure probationary period, the possibility of transition between employment tracks, increased use of part-time and decreased full-time employment, implementation tenure-clock-stopping policies and hiring both couple policies are used as a range of bilateral(winwin) policies (for universities and faculty members). Universities should proportionate faculty recruit policies and practices in line with the economic realities of their environment and consider policies that enhance performance and create a balance between work and life of faculty members.

J	Alibakhshi, N; Mahmoudi, G				Alibakhshi, Noushin; Mahmoudi, Ghahraman			The relation between flexibility of human resources and performance indexes of selected hospitals of Tehran Medical Sciences University	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH & HEALTH SCIENCES			English	Article						human resources flexibility; performance indexes; hospitals		Today, flexibility has turned to one of important issues in management theories and policies and most current discussions about flexibility patterns focus on management policies, so that these patterns are one of important aspects of human resources strategic management. This study was performed with the aim of assessing the flexibility rate of human resources and performance indexes of Tehran Medical Sciences University hospitals and determining the possible relation between these variables. The present study is descriptive-analytical which was conducted in cross-sectional form in 2015. The statistical population was selected by stratifies random sampling method as 317 persons from nursing, administrative and financial personnel of 5 hospitals of Tehran Medical Sciences University. Data collecting toll was hospitals performance indexes form and Wright &Snell flexibility questionnaire of human resources. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 18 software and with the aid of descriptive statistical indexes and linear regression analysis. The results showed that personnel (human resources) had high flexibility mu = 4.16. there was a significant relation between total flexibility and the index of bed circulation so that by one unit increase in bed circulation space, normally, the average of total flexibility decreased 0.64 units (p-value< 0.05). The results showed that human resources of Tehran Medical Sciences University hospitals have high flexibility, so authorities and policy makers are suggested to adopt policies of human resources management for creating flexibility in human resources and improving hospitals performance and amending hospitals status.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted a longitudinal case study of a military SOE, the Aosheng Group, between 1951 and 2012 to understand the dynamics between institutions and organizations. A comparative analysis between the main stages of evolution was completed, and conclusions about the main patterns of organizational and institutional change were reached. Findings - The study reports evidence on the coevolutionary nature of change in big SOEs in China, demonstrating how institutional changes are bigger drivers in promoting reorientations than are market pressures. Within the framework of punctuated equilibrium theory, the determining role that managers may play in leading and implementing organizational reorientations is emphasized. Research limitations/implications - A triangulated methodology was employed to analyse a long period; however, its application to just a single case might be questioned in terms of generalizing any of the findings. Originality/value - The longitudinal perspective applied in this case study contributes to critical questioning as to how Chinese agencies define forms of control and the goals for SOEs under their jurisdiction and the importance of allowing managerial discretion to the assigned managers.

S	Balakrishnan, MS		Balakrishnan, MS; Lindsay, V		Balakrishnan, Melodena Stephens			Wamda: Setting an Example for Scale-Up and Collaborative Entrepreneurship	SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURS	Actions and Insights-Middle East North Africa		English	Article; Book Chapter								Wamda.com is a leading grassroot "platform of programs and networks that aims to accelerate entrepreneurship ecosystems across MENA." It focuses on supporting entrepreneurship through "community development, media, research, and advisory services." Wamda was launched as a CSR initiative in 2010 by the Abraaj Group (Abraaj) and founded by Fadi Ghandour, Abraaj and Habib Hadad in 2011. The story of Wamda's launch was captured in detail in a previous case study "Abraaj Capital Limited: Celebration of Entrepreneurship."(1) From being wholly dependent on Abraaj for funding, Wamda quickly evolved to become independent and self-funding without losing the key purpose of establishment. They were able to create a distinct and value-added portfolio of products. Wamda Community Programs was part of their initial portfolio of key products. Wamda was able to evolve the offerings and create collaborative events with leading organizations in the MENA region. This gave opportunities to entrepreneurs to find mentors and pitch to potential investors. Wamda is able to foster a spirit of volunteerism thus matching mentors for aspiring and early-stage entrepreneurs. Wamda shares knowledge on the entrepreneurial ecosystem to inspire and to provide expert advice, and provides pivotal information to decision makers that could impact or influence the ecosystem. These community programs are great networking events but more importantly bring the fledgling startup community together. Wamda Media debuted at the CoE launch. It has expanded media coverage in Arabic, English, and French to inspire entrepreneurs and their supporters in the Arab world. Wamda Media (including its in-house Wamda TV) records and spotlights startup events across the region, publishes expert advice and op-eds, reports on sector overviews and trends, captures stories on new startups, M&As and funding activity in the region. As of early 2016, Wamda Media had over 5000 articles published. They have a great archival resource but in today's social media world, who should they collaborate with to get access to high quality content and to ensure visibility? In 2014, Wamda established the Wamda Research Lab (WRL). The purpose of WRL is to inform investors, policymakers, and other stakeholders on the entrepreneurship ecosystem and suggest possible solutions to overcome the challenges. Wamda Media and WRL have been quoted by international media like Forbes, Endeavor, TechCrunch, Deloitte, The Wall Street Journal, The Huffington Post, Al Jazeera, Knowledge@Wharton, MIT Press Journal, and the World Economic Forum. Their reach is crossing MENA into other markets. How do they ensure that the data helps relevant decision makers support and encourage entrepreneurship in the region? The fact that there is an increasing interest in the region from the west makes this an even more important factor for young entrepreneurs. Wamda is also beginning to offer corporate advisory services. In April 2015, they worked with General Electric on the MEMakers plaftorm and the MEMakers Venture Program. In early 2015, Wamda worked with Zain (Jordan) to create the Traxn accelerator program. In October 2015, they worked with the World Bank and Kuwait's SME Fund, to launch Nuwait, a storytelling platform that highlights the work of Kuwaiti entrepreneurs. In January 2016, Expo2020 Dubai and Wamda partnered on Collaborative Entrepreneurship. How does Wamda leverage its strengths further? Do they take a catalyst role or a consultancy role by becoming more proactive? In 2015 the newly formed Wamda Venture Capital Fund began to address a serious gap in the ecosystem to provide venture funding to seed and growth stage startups. How do they help startups scale? Wamda's evolving product portfolio, strategic tie-ups, and the support they provide to the entrepreneurship ecosystem have helped it become a leading force to reckon with in the region. How do they continue to grow? Should they look outside the region to encourage scaling? Habib has a strong talented team but the one thing they don't have is time. How do they manage the pace?

J	Barbic, F; Hidalgo, A; Cagliano, R				Barbic, Frano; Hidalgo, Antonio; Cagliano, Raffaella			Governance dynamics in multi-partner R&D alliances Integrating the control and coordination perspectives	BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Governance dynamics; Alliance governance mechanisms; Contractual mechanisms; Relational mechanisms; Multi-partner alliance; Life cycle	INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS; RELATIONAL GOVERNANCE; FORMAL CONTRACTS; PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS; APPROPRIATION CONCERNS; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; TRUST; COLLABORATION; MECHANISMS; COOPERATION	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the dynamics of contractual and relational mechanisms during different phases of multi-partner R&D alliances. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a longitudinal single case study to gain in-depth understanding of which governance mechanisms are best suited for different phases of alliance collaboration. Applying a retrospective strategy for data collection, three rounds of interviews were conducted with representatives of all partner firms. The data were complemented by documentary analysis of both internal documents and publicly available information. Findings - The findings suggest that the use of governance mechanisms in multi-partner alliances depends on the characteristics of alliance phases. Relational governance is most important in the exploration and development phases, while the importance of contractual governance comes to the fore during the development and finalization phases. Despite the predominance of one type of mechanism, the findings support a complementary perspective of governance mechanisms. Research limitations/implications - The results of a single case study offer limited generalizability and should thus be treated with caution. More cross-industry, cross-national studies should be conducted to verify the applicability of the findings to other industries, cultures and geographical contexts. Practical implications - Managers should be aware that different phases of the alliance life cycle have different control and coordination needs, and should rely on different mechanisms during different phases of the alliance. Originality/value - The authors have synthesized insights from various perspectives (transaction cost economics, organization theory, social exchange theory), and developed a multidisciplinary approach to multi-partner collaborations.
