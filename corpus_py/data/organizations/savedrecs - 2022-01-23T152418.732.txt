J	Brooks, KA; Clarke, J				Brooks, Kendra Abkowitz; Clarke, James			Assessing impacts to Tennessee State Park infrastructure caused by extreme weather events	JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Vulnerability; Resilience; Building infrastructure damage assessment; Extreme weather impacts; Facility exposure to weather; Weather damages to infrastructure		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe a risk-based methodology developed to identify the severity of impacts to various types of infrastructure located within the Tennessee State Park system when exposed to extreme weather events. Infrastructure systems, composed of various assets, are central to the economic, environmental and cultural functioning of the society. Understanding the potential impacts to these assets from various threats is fundamental to prudent strategic, operational and financial decision-making. Among infrastructure, systems of interest are those managed and operated by park services. Such systems are particularly exposed to extreme weather, given the recreational activities that they provide. Design/methodology/approach - This paper describes a risk-based methodology developed to identify the severity of impacts to various types of infrastructure located within the Tennessee State Park system when exposed to extreme weather events. It consists of the following steps: identifying extreme weather event types experienced in Tennessee; assessing damage to various types of park system infrastructure caused by these events; and deriving an overall impact score associated with specific types of park system infrastructure when exposed to certain types of extreme weather scenarios. Findings - In applying this methodology, tornadic events were found to be most impactful, whereas drought and heat events had the least effect on park infrastructure. Dining and lodging infrastructure were found to incur the most damage, regardless of the weather event type. Originality/value - The approach as described in this paper is transferable to other park systems as well as public sector assets in general.

J	Brown, W				Brown, William			Teaching Strategic Management to Nonprofit Students	JOURNAL OF NONPROFIT EDUCATION AND LEADERSHIP			English	Article						strategic management; instructional approaches; nonprofit	ORGANIZATIONS; PERFORMANCE; ACCOUNTABILITY; MISSION	Strategic management is a multidisciplinary concept with rich theoretical and empirical backgrounds that can inform decision making in organizations. Strategic management is defined as a blend of management practices that entails interpreting environmental conditions and designing systems to foster success (Miles & Snow, 1978). Applying strategic management concepts to the nonprofit sector is not a new idea (Kearns, 1994; Moore, 2000; Oster, 1995), but translating those concepts in a way that is instrumental to students in a nonprofit management class remains a challenge. In this paper, I introduce a framework to inform strategic thinking and suggest how to introduce these ideas to students studying nonprofit management. The four components of the framework are summarized and teaching strategies are reviewed	[Brown, William] Texas A&M Univ, Nonprofit Management Program, Bush Sch Govt & Publ Serv, College Stn, TX 77843 USA		Brown, W (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Nonprofit Management Program, Bush Sch Govt & Publ Serv, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.	wbrown@tamu.edu					ALLIO RJ, 2006, STRATEGY LEADERSHIP, V0034, P00004, DOI DOI 10.1108/10878570610676837; Altschuld J.

Given the time-limited nature of consultations, a new and more time-efficient approach is needed which addresses multiple health needs simultaneously, and encourages patient self-management to address health risks. The aim of this cluster randomised controlled trial is to test the effectiveness of a patient feedback intervention in improving patient self-management of health needs related to smoking, risky alcohol consumption and underscreening for cancers at 1 month follow-up. Methods and analysis: Adult general practice patients will be invited to participate in a baseline survey to assess cancer risk factors, screening needs and depression. A total of 360 participants identified by the baseline survey as having at least one health need (a self-reported cancer risk factor, underscreening for cancer, or an elevated depression score) will be randomised to an intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group will receive tailored printed feedback summarising their identified health needs and recommended self-management actions to address these. All participants will be invited to complete a telephone interview 1 month following recruitment to assess self-management actions taken in relation to health needs identified in the baseline survey. Control group participants will receive tailored printed feedback on their identified health needs after their follow-up interview. A logistic regression model, with group allocation as the main predictor, will be used to assess the impact of the intervention on self-management actions. Ethical considerations and dissemination: Participants identified as being at risk of depression will be advised to speak with their doctor. Results will be disseminated via publication in peer-reviewed journals. The study has been approved by the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee.

For this purpose a Confirmatory Factor Analysis was conducted to assess how well the measured variables represent the constructs, which according to several authors of the literature, have been identified as limitations to organizational decision-making. In this study they were classified in three dimensions: limitations on Strategic Management, limitations on Human Resource Management and limitations on Financial Management.The analysis is based on data collected from 229 Mexican companies. The results show that the proposed model is a good measure of inflexibility in decision-making of these organizations. In addition, it was identified that the variable that best predicts the limitations in strategic management is the lack of clear objectives. Furthermore, it was found that the strongest predictor of limitations on human resources management is the presence of conflicts between employees; and regarding limitations on financial management, the best predictor is the falling profits of the organization. It is expected that this model will help organizations to identify and eliminate these limitations that constraint the organizational decision-making, facilitating their capability to adapt to the changing environment.

We argue that historical cases can be an effective tool to acquire management skills, with its main advantage being its ability to induce critical thinking which allows strategic decisions to be made in a variety of contexts. Of course there is the question of relevancy of using past behaviour to guide the future. Design/methodology/approach - To answer this main criticism, we review the use of history in the study of business and management disciplines, before examining the way in which a historical case related to the entrepreneurial history of colonial Hong Kong can be constructed for the teaching of an international management subject. Wethen examine the impact of the use of such a historical case in the understanding and satisfaction of teaching. Findings - We discuss the ways in which a historical case can be constructed. We found that overall students enjoy learning through a historical case. Originality/value - This is the first paper examining how a historical case of multinational enterprises can be constructed for the teaching of international management.

J	Chierici, P				Chierici, Pietro			Development and enhancement of football stadiums. Strategies, tools and opportunities for establishing an Italian model	TECHNE-JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY FOR ARCHITECTURE AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Compact city; Urban development; Sport infrastructure; Multi-purpose stadium; Economic and Financial Sustainability		For several years in Europe the concept of the stadium has been undergoing a process of transformation, from that of a mere "container of events" into infrastructure which promotes and produces services, thereby becoming an independent profit centre capable of generating financial, location and professional opportunities. In Italy, the process of development of sport facilities lags significantly behind, demonstrating the need to introduce new ways of managing them and having them interact with the local area in order to respond to the demands of market dynamics and local development policies, thus solving the age-old problem of the relationship between the stadium and the city. Specifically, the issue of redevelopment and conversion of Italian stadiums, which are generally poorly attended and maintained, is the strategic focus of interventions, with a view to improving the functional structure of existing facilities, enhancing their integration with local communities and fostering new management models. Based on recent legislation and procedures and the introduction of new financing instruments, this paper sets out to analyse a possible development process for Italian stadiums in order to outline an operational strategy which draws on successful experiences in Europe and is in line with national legislation as well as urban and local planning models.

J	Chinyamurindi, W				Chinyamurindi, Willie			Middle manager role and contribution towards the competitive intelligence process: A case of Irish subsidiaries	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							PERFORMANCE; ORGANIZATION; PERSPECTIVE; ORIENTATION	Background: Calls have been made especially during a period of global competition and economic austerity for research that focuses on how competitive intelligence (CI) is actually generated within organisations. Objectives: The aim of this study was to understand the views and experiences of middle managers with regard to their role and contribution towards the CI process within Irish subsidiaries of the Multinational Corporation (MNC). Method: The study adopts a qualitative approach using the semi-structured interview technique to generate narratives and themes around how CI is generated using a sample of 15 middle managers drawn from five participating Irish subsidiaries. Results: Based on the analysis of the narratives of the middle managers, three main themes emerged as findings. Firstly, the process of gathering CI was facilitated by the reliance on internal and external tools. Secondly, information gathered from the use of such tools was then communicated by middle managers to top managers to inform the making of strategic decisions. Thus, (and thirdly), middle managers were found to occupy an important role not only through the execution of their management duties but by extending this influence towards the generation of information deemed to affect the competitive position of not just the subsidiary but also the parent company. Conclusion: The study concludes by focusing on the implications and recommendations based on the three themes drawn from the empirical data.

J	Chohan, B				Chohan, Babar			Testing transport policy perceptions of the government, the experts and the local community: the case of New Zealand's MacKays to Peka Peka expressway	TECHNE-JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY FOR ARCHITECTURE AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Urban roads; Infrastructure; Policy; Economic growth		Enhancing economic growth and productivity is the main objective of the National-led government's policy of building seven initial Roads of National Significance in New Zealand. In this regard, several justifications have been advanced by the government on economic, technological, political and aesthetic fronts to achieve economic growth. The justifications are advanced through a national level statutory framework consisting of the legislations on resource management, transport management and local government affairs. The statutory legal framework dissipates the justifications into national, regional and district level transport policy documents in a coherent manner. However, these policy justifications are perceived differently by the government, the experts and the local residents. Theoretically following Flyvbjerg's (2014) four sublimes, the gap in the perceptions of justifications has exposed several transport policy deficiencies in the decision-making process involving massive advancement of infrastructure. This article takes up the case of MacKays to Peka Peka expressway and reviews the relevant documents to navigate the direction of policy arguments advanced for promoting economic growth and productivity. It also analyses the views of the experts and the local community for mapping the policy perceptions gap. It is argued that the non-participation of public at the strategic level decision-making has created pseudo-context which ignores the actual context. The article concludes by discussing the challenges related with accelerating economic growth and productivity in the context of the expressway.

Thus, for the realization of this article, it is based on concepts of Logistics according to supply chain, intending to analyse operational processes and suggest improvements in results and competitive gains for collaboration in the chain of trade in pieces of industrial equipment company in the Greater Sao Paulo region. Therefore, we conducted literature searches through books and articles, as well as a case study, which in general, revealed that the supply chain of the studied company has great potential for improvement it once has modest integration actions compared to a model with a strategic focus and some deviations compared to the academic literature. Research results have shown issues such as ignorance of the subject proposed by the employees as well as the need to create alternatives to maximize the interaction between the sectors within the organization contributing more competitive solutions in addition to providing agility in the process as a whole. To carry out further research, it is recommended further study regarding the implementation of management information systems to improve some processes and, consequently, the outcome of that organization.

In this context, the appropriate distribution planning figures as a strategic activity in the generation of competitiveness. Previous studies that analyzed the transportation problem do not consider the role of the expedition in their models. This research investigated a transportation problem considering the expedition of goods. A midsize retailer located in the ABC region of Sao Paulo was used to conduct a case study. In addition to documentary data, interviews were conducted with professionals involved in the expedition operation. The results indicated that the company could optimize their expedition by considering the changes proposed in this study. We conclude that the expedition is an important activity in the analysis of a transport model.

Design/methodology/approach - The findings are based on the experiences of health and social care professionals from six Local Authorities and one Regional Health Board working in a management role with strategic responsibility, gathered from an online survey (n = 43), semi-structured face-to-face interviews (n +/- 14) and supplemented with reflective interviews with regional coordinators responsible for facilitating cross-organisational working (n = 2). Findings - Senior managers are devoting considerable energy to understanding the implications of the new legislation, ensuring that their organisations will be ready and able to successfully implement it. This work is perceived to be commensurate with wider agendas to transform and integrate working practices and services, influenced by a range of financial, environmental, organisational, social and policy factors. Originality/value - This research has direct implications for stakeholders in North Wales, having already been used to shape conversations about integration in the region, and furthermore builds upon existing knowledge in the academic and professional field of integration, with additional limited wider implications for policy and research.

J	de la Torre, R; Lusa, A; Mateo, M				de la Torre, Rocio; Lusa, Amaia; Mateo, Manuel			Evaluating the Impact of Strategic Personnel Policies Using a MILP Model: The Public University Case	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-JIEM			English	Article						strategic staff decisions; university; MILP		Purpose: The main purpose of the paper is to evaluate the impact of diverse personnel policies around personnel promotion in the design of the strategic staff plan for a public university. The strategic staff planning consists in the determination of the size and composition of the workforce for an organization. Design/methodology/approach: The staff planning is solved using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. The MILP model represents the organizational structure of the university, the personnel categories and capacity decisions, the demand requirements, the required service level and budget restrictions. All these aspects are translated into a set of data, as well as the parameters and constraints building up the mathematical model for optimization. The required data for the model is adopted from a Spanish public university. Findings: The development of appropriate policies for personnel promotion can effectively reduce the number of dismissals while proposing a transition towards different preferable workforce structures in the university. Research limitations/implications: The long term staff plan for the university is solved by the MILP model considering a time horizon of 8 years. For this time horizon, the required input data is derived from current data of the university. Different scenarios are proposed considering different temporal trends for input data, such as in demand and admissible promotional ratios for workers. Originality/value: The literature review reports a lack of formalized procedures for staff planning in universities taking into account, at the same time, the regulations on hiring, dismissals, promotions and the workforce heterogeneity, all considered to optimize workforce size and composition addressing not only an economic criteria, but also the required workforce expertise and the quality in the service offered. This paper adopts a formalized procedure developed by the authors in previous works, and exploits it to assess the impact of various personnel policies in the staff planning for a particular university case, and this is the principal contribution of the paper.

The ESF defines and evaluates over time the firm's strategic profile in its external strategic front, as defined by the strategic business unit, capital markets and social context; and in its internal strategic front, as defined by the basic elements of the internal framework of the firm itself. The originality of the ESF lies in defining the relationship between external and internal strategic fronts of the firm based on structural-systemic-dynamic consonance over time between all its elements. The firm's ESF is a guide for managers and entrepreneurs in defining the firm strategic profile and evaluating it over time.

J	Ditlevsen, MG				Ditlevsen, Marianne Grove			On the Discursive Construction of the Equity Story in PowerPoint Presentations	FACHSPRACHE-JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Investor Relations; discourse analysis; corporate communication; strategic communication; financial communication		It is the aim of this paper to contribute to a communication perspective on the study of the equity story seen as a strategic management tool within Investor Relations (IR). To be more specific, a first step is offered towards developing characteristics of how the equity story is discursively constructed. An international small-scale study of selected PowerPoint presentations serves as point of departure. The focus of the analysis is three main characteristics of the equity story when seen as an IR strategic management tool: the importance of both forward and backward looking parameters; the importance of both financial and non-financial information; and the two inherent, potentially conflicting communicative purposes: to give a true and a fair view of the state of the company's affairs and to provide a positive image of the company. In order to account for the discursive construction of these characteristics, a method assemblage is applied and an analysis of temporal reference, a topic analysis and an analysis of visual means of communication have been conducted. The study reveals two main characteristics of the discursive construction of the equity story that point to the strategic use of the equity story not only as a means of making a company's share attractive, but also as a means of making it more attractive than comparable companies' share.

Traditional outcome measurements were not sufficient to convince tax-depleted legislatures to allocate more funds to libraries. In response to the crisis authors recommended cost-saving measures and tactics for perception management. Studies have shown that the demand for library services increases during times of economic hardship. The production of a strategic plan justifying budget requests is necessary in those times, and should be accompanied by efforts to secure endowment and donation opportunities. This column provides a table or "blueprint for successful strategic planning" that matches goals, actions and measurement criteria.

J	El-Methnani, R				El-Methnani, Ridha			Of strategy: An analytical study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMANITIES AND CULTURAL STUDIES			English	Article						Strategy; communication; position; management; influence; performance; competence; capacities; resources; policy; establishment; destruction		It is a study that deals with the definition of strategy, as well as its common patterns, specificities, components, types and aims. This research mainly focuses on the conceptual meanings of the strategy, therefore it aims to establish a significant strong knowledge base that can be considered as a benchmark for any communication strategy and may be useful to any communication planner, regardless of the organizing structure's nature whether a state, a company, an organization, or an establishment. "Strategy" has appeared in the so-called "media planning"", it was used in determining the countries' and media institutions' media policies, within short, mid and long terms. Thus many concepts came up such as "educational media planning" and "development media plans "also in crisis management: "pre-crisis communication planning", "crisis communication plans" and "postcrisis communication planning". Claude-Yves Charron widely spoke about "communication strategies", when defining the organizational communication as "the process of creating an exchange of messages through a network of interconnected elements, in order to provide the organization's needs" (Charron,1998); the strategy in that way is "the art of using the means to achieve the purpose", and its impact on selecting targets and identifying them, and selecting the methods in order to achieve them, as well as developing operational plans. Communication strategies include "push strategy", "pull strategy", and others. Strategy seems to be irregularly present in the different stages of information and communication sciences in a way or another; it has always been a strategic component of the communicational way of thinking. "Strategy" was adopted by " information and communication sciences" in different branches of its wide field of knowledge. It is rather to affirm that " information and communication sciences", as innovative sciences, exploited strategy and got inspired with curricula and approaches. By the nineties of the twentieth century the concept of strategy has entered a new turning point, by the emergence of the information society. In that historical phase the term " strategy" has known different semantics. The information has become the raw material of the society. Nowadays The information in terms of knowledge, is " the source of power and wealth", and is therefore "the essence of power" itself as mentioned Alvin Toffler. By studying strategy through its definition, patterns, specificities, components, types and goals, necessary knowledge base is established in order to set different communication strategies. It concerns either the state as an organized structure, or institutions, organizations or establishments. In fact, communication strategy does not stand unique but is basically related to the strategy concept in general, or even to the strategy as a term. This strategy is a highly complicated phenomenon in itself. It has lots of semantics and dimensions that enriches the concept and gives an extra-value to the study.

This analysis of MOOC strategies is carried out from the point of view of the main actors and outlines the context, process and arguments that led to the collaboration of the two institutions and the decisions they made to strategically position and implement their MOOC initiatives. Building on the collaboration instigated in the G3 initiative, the two institutions worked together to develop the positioning underlying the process, which led to some similar choices (means to ensure quality, research/deployment harmonization), but also some different ones. Each institution anticipated benefits based on its own context, which ultimately influenced its specific choice of courses: pedagogical innovation, professional development, focus on research work or teaching work, production of widely accessible and reusable educational resources, etc. The explanation of the choices made and their impacts is informative for any institution that wishes to develop its own MOOC strategy.

J	Goncales, M; Barros, MJ; de Campos, FC				Goncales Filho, Manoel; Barros, Marcos Jose; de Campos, Fernando Celso			Kaizen Application at The Reception Stage in a Sugarcane Plant	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNTING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Lean Manufacturing; Value Stream Mapping; Production Management; Plant Sugar and Alcohol		The main reasons for the decline of the sugar and alcohol sector in the last decade are the increased cost of production, delayed investment in the recovery of sugarcane plantations aiming higher production volumes, lack of competitiveness of ethanol and sugar and lack of investment in new technologies. This situation faced by the sugarcane industry in Piracicaba/SP leads the sugarcane companies to seek increasingly competitiveness. This condition leads to continuous improvements, like the development of production systems. In this sense, a new operational and strategic orientation is needed to achieve the objective of profit maximization, and to excel in the current situation through an increase in productivity. In this paper, we intend to achieve the application of kaizen in the production process of a sugar and alcohol plant, specifically, at the reception of sugarcane. Therefore, this paper aims to apply the concept of lean manufacturing to maximize the yield of sugarcane reception process. The research method used was obtained in an exploratory literature review of the main concepts of lean production in order to provide the necessary basis for application of kaizen. A case study was carried out for the implementation of the concept. The contribution of this work is at pointing out improvements in the sugarcane reception process through a lean tool, the Current and Future Value Stream Mapping.

J	Hassuny, AR				Hassuny, A. R.			THE TRAINING KNOWELDGE NEEDS FOR BARLEY GROWERS TO MANAGE THEIR CROP AT AL-SHIHIMIYA TOWNSHIP - ALSWIRA TOWN - WASIT GOVERNORATE	IRAQI JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			Arabic	Article						Training needs; Barley; problems		This research aimed to determine the level of training knowledge needed for barley growers to manage their crop at Al-shihimiya Township -Alswira Town -Wasit Governorate. The training knowledge needed aimed to cover all crop management axes which included land preparation, date of seeding fertilizer and pesticides application, irrigation and harvest, to recognize the most important problems faced by barley growers during growing period. To archive that goal a randomized sample was taken 5% from the growers' population 2126 (i.e. the sample size was 106 growers). The statistical analysis covered 100 growers and data collected through questionnaires sheet. This sheet included two parts: 1st one aimed to test the training knowledge needed for barley growers to manage their crop at the field through 47 paragraphs distributed to 6 axises which included land preparation, date of seeding fertilizer and pesticides application, irrigation and harvest. The 2nd part included 12 suggested problems facing barley growers during crop management. Results indicated that 51% of the questioned growers had high training qualifications and this represent 117.49 grade on the scale of 0-141 for training knowledge needed. The most problems facing the growers is the delay in receiving their money dues with an important grade of 3. The 2nd faced problem growers faced was the import of barley crop by the government which had 1.89 grades. Therefore, it can be con concluded that Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) have to activate the role of agriculture extension through their personals available at the ministry directorates and extension centers through training programs and extension activities related mainly to strategic crop in general and barley crop in particular and encourage growers to join such this activities. Furthermore, MOA should provide agricultural chemicals and agricultural equipments as a part of the subsidizing program Iraqi government have and help farmers to collect their grains and make sure to pay for it at the right time from the MAO and the Ministry of Trade (MOT) due to the dependence of those growers on this income for their life support	[Hassuny, A.

This current study extends that literature by being the first to investigate the synergistic relationship life and non-life insurance activities share with economic growth. We collect data that includes 84 national markets representing a broad spectrum of economic development over the 1994-2012 period and employ system-generalised method of moment (GMM) estimation technique based on a dynamic model structure. Our results support the hypothesis that life and non-life insurance synergies share a positive relationship with economic growth and that positive relationship experiences diminishing marginal returns as the insurance markets mature. The results of our study provide implications for policymakers with regard to market liberalisation strategies, as well as implications for the management of insurance companies contemplating foreign market expansion strategies.

The market economic efficiency is mainly dependent on transmission system support. The inability of transmission system support to drive market cleared schedule is known as congestion and which is not desirable. The remedial actions to relieve congestion in the transmission system known as congestion relief approaches and are differ in various markets around the world. The objective of this paper is to illustrate some of the technical and non-technical approaches using simple case studies.

J	Jones, G; Bowrey, G; Beattie, C; Smark, C				Jones, Greg; Bowrey, Graham; Beattie, Claire; Smark, Ciorstan			LOCAL COUNCIL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT: ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF POLICY CHANGE AND PROPOSED ALMAGAMATIONS	AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Local councils; policy; amalgamation; investment; accounting		New South Wales (NSW) councils are tasked with providing a wide range of resources and services to their communities. However, the conditions and rules under which councils are allowed to operate are not constant. Changes in state government policies and political affiliation have the capacity to alter the focus and rules under which councils function. Political and economic events result in new and sometimes radically different requirements with which councils are required to conform. As policies change, reforms are introduced and the political landscape alters, councils are expected to alter their actions to coincide with expectations of the state government, while still meeting the needs and expectations of their respective communities. This paper evaluates the way that councils have reacted to changes in investment policy prior, and subsequent to, the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and compares those actions to those currently being undertaken by councils in response to the state government review of local councils with a particular focus on measures of financial viability. The purpose is to demonstrate how council's actions are influenced by changes to policy and requirements of the state government and to consider the role that accounting plays in facilitating council's actions. One purpose of financial reports is to provide information to assist users to make valid and informed decisions, to aid planning and inform strategic decision making. Financial reports which are affected by changing requirements due to the political environment, future financial and governance decisions will also be impacted.

J	Kanli, B				Kanli, Bakir			An Alternative Perspective to "the Owenite Movement" Window to Sustainable Cities: "Neighbourhood Cooperatives"	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Sustainability; Neighbourhood; Cooperative; Owenite movement; Neighbourhood Cooperatives	ROBERT OWEN	The struggle for sustaining existence and environment of humans is as old as humanity. Capitalism has accelerated problems relating to sustainability. Many scholars have endeavoured to address these problems by purposing an alternative social order. Robert Owen is one of these scholars. He shares that the clues for reaching sustainable communities could be achieved by advocating a cooperative-oriented life style. Even though his idea of villages of cooperation became an intellectual phenomenon this theoretical phenomenon of the Owenite Movement, proved a practical failure due to several inaccuracies. In this paper, developments of the cooperative system concepts, the Owen's point of view and his implementations are analysed. Through the analyses the new term of "Neighbourhood Cooperatives", which may play a key role in fulfilling the basic services of local community, is proposed. The term is considered as a strategic tool embracing entirely the components of sustainability. These components include social, economic, environmental and governance which are also seen as a building blocks leading to sustainable cities. The paper also deals with the scope of neighbourhood cooperatives, its functions and services, and their positions at a management level. And in the final section particular inferences will be made regarding possible benefits such as social, cultural, economic and governance.

J	Kelly, KJ				Kelly, Keith J.			Liabilities of regionalization and the emerging market firm	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS			English	Article						Regionalization; International diversification; Emerging markets; Global strategy; Liabilities of foreignness	FOREIGNNESS; INVESTMENT; STRATEGIES; GROWTH; PERSPECTIVE; EXPANSION	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to revisit the causal relationships of the liabilities of inter-regional foreignness to show that the process of regionalization itself has affected firms' strategic capabilities and focus. The constraints of these regions, a consequence of regionalization that limits the strategic options of multinational enterprises, are known as the liabilities of regionalization (LOR). Design/methodology/approach - This study reviews previous literature and uses a mixture of theory and inference to make propositions regarding the existence of liabilities attributable to the regionalization process. The propositions discuss macro-level, and industry and firm-level strategic impact on firms of Triad and non-Triad regions. Findings - It is argued specific emerging market attributes, in relation to the developed Triad regions, will influence strategic focus of those emerging market firms. This in turn will also influence global strategic behavior and capabilities in the future, creating additional LOR in some cases and reducing them in others. Originality/value - Previous scholars have focused on the liabilities of inter-regional and regional foreignness and its effect on international diversification strategy both upstream and downstream. This study attempts to explain the formation of regions that shape the FSAs that limit global strategic diversification, which are characterized as the LOR.

'CLOCK SPEED' THEORY OF STRATEGY MAKING ALONG THE LIFE CYCLE	POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						clock speed theory; strategic horizon; strategy making; market life cycle; hi-tech and retail sector		Regardless of sector, the long term viability of a firm is strongly tied to the quality and timeliness of its strategies. In hi-tech, events unfold much faster than in other value-creating business activities and hence the strategy changes its scope, its focus and implementation challenges often. This article will present a model that can be relied upon to gauge the need for different strategic engagements at four critical points of the market development: start-up, growth, leveling off/shakeout and maturity. The article also surfaces the importance of the elements of speed, horizon and focus to strategy making in hi-tech and comments on the evolution of market complexity.

J	Kos, D				Kos, Domen			COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE POLITICAL MANAGEMENT DIMENSIONS OF LOCAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNS	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE POLITICS			English	Article						political management; local elections; local election campaign; dimensions; analytical framework		Political management o f local election campaigns is the central topic of this article, which presents a wide range of factors and components of the local election campaigns, which will be called dimensions in order to unify the terminology. All dimensions are connected on the basis o f the strategic dimension o f political management. The dimensions are set through theoretical and empirical findings of authors from diverse environments. Different experiences indicate various dimensions of local election campaigns (normative and systemic, political and environmental, geographical and demographical, organizational and executive, strategic, and the dimensions o f sources, interaction, candidate, time, and intensity). AH these fundamental dimensions consist of a different number of sub-dimensions. Depending on the environment of the study, they are extremely diverse in meaning. The synthesis of international theoretical and empirical findings can be found in the form of a newly established analytical framework for the exploration o f local election campaigns. With the appropriate adjustments to the different contexts of each country, this framework can also be used in the international arena in the field of directly elected representatives o f the local self-government authorities. The article closes with a discussion about the empirical testing of the established analytical framework.

(hereinafter referred to as Sun Pharma), with specific reference to India Business, through financial ratios Initially the financial performance of Sun Pharma is analysed in terms of Net Sales, Net Profit, Assets and EPS.. In addition, the financial performance of the company is compared with Indian pharma industry average. The industry average is established by considering the weighted average performance of five pharma companies, which are listed in BSE and ranked according to market capitalization. For this purpose financial ratios of the category viz., Liquidity, Asset Management, Debt Management, Profitability and Market are applied. It is observed from the study that the financial ratios, based on the stand alone key information, may give lackluster impression about the company's current financial performance but their strategic decisions, of global exposure through the mergers and acquisition route, are expected to change its present scenario in the near future.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors employ a unique data set of 148 cartel data points from the 1970s to 2008 which have at least one American company involved to quantitatively test causal relationships. The authors also interview key class action anti-trust attorneys for their views and opinions on the impact of these environmental factors on cartel formation and continuance. Findings - The authors find statistically significant relationships between the pursuit and maintenance of industry profits and the dynamism in the industry, and illegal behavior as represented through price fixing by business cartels. The authors find that in the attorneys' opinion, it is also the pursuit of individual corporate profits and munificence that are associated with these cartels. Practical implications - This research furthers the understanding of organizational deviance which is critical given its impact on organizations, individuals, regulators, law enforcement, and the general public. Originality/value - This research is a first step in considering cartel activity in a way that encompasses external influences in a new and innovative manner and as a tool to help researchers and practitioners better understand how organizational deviance, as manifested through illegal corporate activity, can be anticipated, identified, and prevented.

Applying bibliographic literature research, eight models of project portfolio management were identified, analyzed, compared and consolidated in terms of common dimensions. The results present a conceptual model of PPM more consolidated and comprehensive, bringing together the main characteristics of the models identified in the literature. This model can be used by organizations in strategic project selection and portfolio management. In addition, this study contributes to discussions about methodology for PPM and provides theoretical insights for conducting empirical studies in organizations.

J	Lawrie, G; Abdullah, NA; Bragg, C; Varlet, G				Lawrie, Gavin; Abdullah, Nur Anisah; Bragg, Christopher; Varlet, Guillaume			Multi-level strategic alignment within a complex organisation	JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance management; Case study; Performance measurement; Strategic control; Balanced Scorecard; Strategic alignment; Cascading	BALANCED SCORECARD; PERFORMANCE-MEASUREMENT; MANAGEMENT; CONSENSUS	Purpose - This paper aims to assess the utility of an approach to the design of multiple Balanced Scorecards within large/complex organisations, consider the relevance of "emergent strategising" in this kind of strategy implementation and explore project organisation and wider coordination issues that impact this type of work. Design/methodology/approach - A "research-oriented - action research" approach has been adopted, comprising qualitative observations of an ongoing programme within a major organisation in the Middle East. The case is based on feedback obtained from key actors (participants, facilitators) and the analysis of documentation produced by the project. Findings - Over four years, the project engaged directly with over 200 managers from the organisation's 35 most senior management units. Its purpose was to align the strategic aims of each unit with those of the organisation and introduce a new form of strategic control. The paper shows that consensus-forming and creation of locally relevant strategic agendas can be usefully and successfully embedded in a large-scale strategic control and alignment programme. The paper notes the large resource implications and duration of such programmes, and the challenges of integrating the resulting processes with those already in place. The paper concludes that for the case organisation, the resource investment appears to have generated useful outcomes. Research limitations/implications - The project relates to a continuing programme within the client organisation that was not explicitly established before it started as an action-research activity. This has limited and constrained the quality of the information reported. Originality/value - The scale of the project, the use of design methods that emphasis consensus forming and local relevance provide novel information and insights.

J	Lindovsky, M				Lindovsky, Milan			Management of Water Treatment Plants During Emergencies	INZYNIERIA MINERALNA-JOURNAL OF THE POLISH MINERAL ENGINEERING SOCIETY			English	Article						water supply system; water treatment; emergency; breakdown; risk analysis; monitoring; controlling		Public water supply systems make a component of the environment with a high significance for preservation of numerous emergency services to the population in case of an emergency. Damage or elimination of potable and fire water production and distribution can significantly reduce living standard of the population, but, more importantly, endanger activity of health facilities, food processing facilities and fire safety in built-up areas. The water supply system incorporates water treatment facilities, which essentially affect quality of the produced water. As the risk of interrupted supply of potable water for natural or anthropogenic reasons cannot be eliminated, it is necessary to at least minimize negative impacts on the consumers [1]. This article offers a solution of this complicated task in real conditions of water treatment and provision of the necessary amount of potable water during an emergency at least to important consumers and strategic subjects.

From a case study of a Chinese manufacturing firm, we show evidence that traditional firms can utilise the analytical tool of technology mapping to capture new innovation opportunities in emerging industries. In contrast to prior studies that mainly explore how firms learn and accumulate knowledge and capabilities in different growth stages within their respective industry, this study suggests that accumulated technological competency not only can propel a firm to move up on the current value chain but can also help it leap to an emerging market to capture new opportunities.

J	Mahlow, N; Wagner, J				Mahlow, Nils; Wagner, Joel			Process landscape and efficiency in non-life insurance claims management An industry benchmark	JOURNAL OF RISK FINANCE			English	Article						Process efficiency; Claims management model; Industry benchmark; Non-life insurance		Purpose - In view of the fact that claim payouts account for about 70 per cent of annual direct costs in non-life insurance companies and that claims-handling staff sums up to 10-20 per cent of all employees, an optimal claims management environment is of strategic importance. The purpose of this paper is twofold, i.e. on the one hand, the authors introduce a standardized claims management process model and, on the other hand, they apply process benchmarks to various operational parameters. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed claims management process landscape comprises current industry standards for claims handling from a theoretical perspective, supported by practice insights from the industry. Our model aims to reflect the most important claims processing activities. The claims-handling work flow is structured into five core steps, namely, notification, registration, coverage audit, settlement and closing of the claim. For these core steps, the authors differentiate between three claim complexity categories and their associated back-office levels. In the second part of the paper, the authors assess the industry's claims-handling efficiency. The authors benchmark industry processes with reference to detailed claims management data from 11 insurers in Germany and Switzerland. Findings - The benchmarks are based on the previously defined claims management model and are applied separately to the three retail business lines of car, property and liability insurance. We measure claim process times (cycle times) as well as claim quantities and average claim payouts at different levels. Overall, within each business line, more than 30 data points are gathered from each respondent insurer. This allows us to compare the process performance of different insurance companies and to describe significant differences in their process patterns. Furthermore, principal findings are derived from descriptive statistics as well as ad hoc data analyses. Originality/value - The paper seeks to contribute to the discussion of how different insurance companies perform in claims management and to define best practice. Our findings are relevant to academics and practitioners alike.

J	MakiPour, H				MakiPour, Hossein			Investigate the relationship between the process of application and absorption of knowledge with strategic thinking capacity Case Study: Department of Education of Khuzestan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED BIOTECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						application and absorption of knowledge; capacity for strategic thinking; the Department of Education of Khuzestan; SPSS		Dizzying speed of changes in today's world means that conventional methods of management cannot fit with change. When changes were trivial, we could use the experiences but when making decisions have strategic aspect and the results are irreversible and major, you cannot use of making decisions based on the judgment of intuition and experience-based management philosophies. Therefore, the strategic management process is an attempt to provide a second copy of what happens in the very clever and elite human brain, this means that someone who has a direct understanding of affairs and combines knowledge information with scientific analysis determines changes and provides survival of the organization in the field of competition and conflicts. Department of Education of Khuzestan, by using the knowledge, expertise, and experience of a wide range of experts from various fields, engaged to perform multiple activities with various topics related to education in the country. In descriptive data analysis, descriptive statistics and graphs are provided appropriately and in the inferential analysis, the appropriate tests have been investigated in order to confirm or reject the hypothesis. It should be noted that the analysis was performed by using SPSS software. By comparing the significance level obtained by the error coefficient of 0.05 (less than 0.05), we can conclude there is a significant correlation between the application and absorption of knowledge.

This study aimed to develop a participatory strategic management (PSM) model for small school groups, known as Collaborative Educational Provision (CEP) schools that are under the Office of the Basic Education Commission of the Ministry of Education. The methodology used was research and development (R&D) with quantitative and qualitative mixed methods. The PSM model developed was tested utilizing purposive sampling of a group of 4 CEP schools in a district of Chiang Mai and including 4 administrators, 22 teachers, 10 school committee members, 20 parents, and 10 community leaders. The PSM model developed consisted of 4 components with 65 indicators. The four components were participatory in character, and consisted of strategic analysis, strategic planning, strategic implementation, and strategic control and evaluation. After implementation of this PSM model, findings showed that all five of the CEP personnel sampled agreed to a higher level of work practice. They also expressed strong satisfaction with the implementation of the trial model. In particular, this model, focusing on a participatory approach, was able to solve many problems related to small schools, especially teacher shortages.

CSO programming is a key component of Global Fund (GF) grants; however, CSOs face technical and governance capacity challenges in grant utilisation leading to missed opportunities for improving health at community level. Amref Health Africa was appointed Principal Recipient of a GF grant aimed at scaling up community case management of malaria through CSOs as sub-recipients in western Kenya. To identify potential risks and strengthen grant management, Amref Health Africa and the Ministry of Health conducted a capacity needs assessment to determine the capacity of CSOs to effectively utilise grants. Methods: 26 selected CSOs participated in this study. Document reviews and on-site assessments and observations were conducted using structured tool. The five main assessment areas were: governance and risk management; strategic and operational planning; monitoring and evaluation; programme management; and financial management. Overall performance was grouped into four categories: 3.0-2.5 (excellent), 2.0-2.4 (good), 1.5-1.9 (fair), and 1.0-1.4 (poor). Data were collected and analysed using Excel software. Results: twenty five out of 26 CSOs were legally compliant. 14(54%) CSOs were categorized as good; 7(27%) as excellent; 3(12%) as poor and 2(8%) as fair. Most CSOs had good programme management capacity but monitoring and evaluation presented the most capacity gaps. Conclusion: more than 75% of the CSOs were rated as excellent or good. A capacity building plan, programme risk management plan and oversight mechanisms were important for successful grant implementation.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology used to verify the existence of the variables that affect the planning of human resources at the territorial level consists of two phases: a qualitative study of the variables that influence the planning of human resources, where the explicit variables are measured and/or implied raised in the literature analyzing the main contributions and limitations expressed by each of the authors consulted. Then it proceeds to confirmatory phase (quantitative) to prove the existence of the dimensions of the planning of human resources in the territorial level through the use of multivariate statistics through the combination of expert analysis and techniques of factorial grouping. Findings: Identification is achieved by using empirical methods, variables that affect human resources planning at the territorial level, as well as their grouping essential dimensions, while the description of a theoretical model that integrates the dimensions is made essential and relationships that affect human resource planning at the regional level, which is characterized by the existence of systemic and prospective nature. Originality/value: The literature shows two streams that address a wide range of approaches to human resources planning. The first is oriented from the business object and the second part of the management in highlighting a limited territorial level to address this latest theoretical development, an element that has contributed to the fragmented treatment of human resources planning and management in general at this level. The originality of this paper is part of the creation and adaptation, on a scientific basis of a theoretical model developed from the conceptual contribution of this process at the territorial level where the key variables that affect this process are integrated, highlighting the systemic approach prospective based on solid scientific foundations.

Design: The Minority Health Infrastructure Survey was a census design survey distributed to STHAs in 2007, 2010, and 2014. Both cross-sectional and select longitudinal data are presented. Methods: Descriptive data from the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials' Minority Health Infrastructure Survey were recorded, and chi(2) tests were performed on selected variables. Results: In 2007, 95.7% of jurisdictions had a primary contact person for health equity initiatives. That number rose to 98.0% in 2010 and to 100% in 2014. In STHAs with a primary contact person, that individual worked full-time on health equity initiatives in 63.6% of STHAs in 2007, 82.0% of STHAs in 2010, and 81.1% of STHAs in 2014. The proportion of STHAs with an organizational unit devoted to minority health was 78.3% in 2007, 90.2% in 2010, and 84.9% in 2014. In 2014, 92.6% of STHAs had included minority health in an agencywide or dedicated strategic plan. The most common strategies for addressing health equity included in strategic plans were collecting and tracking disparities data (91.8%), leveraging and engaging public/private partners in solutions for health disparities (87.8%), and increasing cultural competency or health literacy (87.8%). All respondents collaborated with external partners on health equity initiatives in some way. Conclusions: STHAs increased their organizational resources to address minority health between 2007 and 2010, but resources leveled off or decreased in some areas between 2010 and 2014. Closing the disparities gap will require substantial nationwide investment and implementing strategies with the potential to make a lasting impact.

J	Mosese, M; Mearns, M				Mosese, Manthisana; Mearns, Martie			Leveraging management information in improving call centre productivity	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Background: The availability and efficient use of management information is one of the key strategic levers in driving growth and competitiveness for companies. Management information facilitates vital decision making that assists organisations in improving their competitiveness. For call centre operations, competitiveness entails improving productivity and customer service, and management information is essential in this endeavour. Objectives: This research explored the use of management information and its impact on two fundamental functions namely, improving productivity without compromising the quality of service, in the call centre of a well-known South African fashion retailer, Edcon. Following the implementation of the call centre technology project the research set out to determine how Edcon can transform their call centre to improve productivity and customer service through effective utilisation of their management information. Method: Internal documents and reports were analysed to provide the basis of evaluation between the measures of productivity prior to and post the implementation of a technology project at Edcon's call centre. Semi-structured in-depth and group interviews were conducted to establish the importance and use of management information in improving productivity and customer service. Results: The results indicated that the availability of management information has indeed contributed to improved efficiency at the Edcon call centre. Although literature claims that there is a correlation between a call centre technology upgrade and improvement in performance, evident in the return on investment being realised within a year or two of implementation, it fell beyond the scope of this study to investigate the return on investment for Edcon's call centre. Conclusion: Although Edcon has begun realising benefits in improved productivity in their call centre from their available management information, information will continue to play a crucial role in supporting management with informed decisions that will improve the call centre operations.

J	Nusinov, V				Nusinov, Vladimir			ASSESSMENT OF THE SEVERITY OF THE CRISIS OF THE UKRAINIAN COMPANIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEASURES FOR ITS ELIMINATION	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						crisis; causes of the crisis; consequences of the crisis; view of crisis; particularly the flow of the crisis; assessment of the severity of the crisis; crisis management		The functioning of the market system everywhere is accompanied by the crisis phenomena. It is impossible to imagine the development of a modern economy without economic UPS and downs, which disrupted the economic stability and the economic entities enter into a certain imbalance. Not exception-eating is the development of the crisis and companies of Ukraine. The origin and course of the crisis in Ukrainian companies requires a deep scientific study of modern economic theory and practice, as it can be considered a certain phenomenon, with significant features in comparison with other countries in crises companies. The manifestation of the crisis can be expressed in the decline in production, the deterioration of economic indicators, the financial insolvency of the company, have other symptoms that characterize its presence, as well as evaluate the various degrees of severity. Despite the fact that the Ukrainian company has led to a crisis, as it was heavy, and what the symptoms manifested, the main aim of the company in a state of crisis of uncertainty is the "survival" of the market and the continuation of further functioning. The issue of assessing the severity of the crisis and to identify measures to eliminate it in Ukrainian companies is extremely important and yet insufficiently developed. This is because, firstly, in economic science remains poorly understood the essence of the crisis, its species and assessment methodology taking into account the realities of the modern Ukrainian. Secondly, the emergence of the crisis in Ukraine-a frequent phenomenon, their course is quite difficult and time-consuming, but also has its own characteristics, depending on the formation of the Ukrainian political and economic systems, historically developed social and economic development of the country, the impact of external macroeconomic factors. These points need to be considered in the development of evidence-based, effective system of anti-crisis solutions for Ukrainian companies. The object of research is process of study of the crisis phenomena and the formation on its basis of anti-crisis measures in the companies. Subject of research-a set of theoretical, methodological and practical aspects of improving the assessment of the severity of the crisis of Ukrainian companies and the formulation of appropriate anti-crisis solutions. The methodological basis of this research is the dialectical method of cognition, systemic and historical approaches to the study of problematic issues, fundamental principles of the economic theory and the theory of crisis management. Applied the following research methods: logical generalization, systemic structural analysis, comparison, statistical, identifying cause-andeffect relationships, matrix, ranking, expert, etc. The purpose of the study is to improve estimates of the severity of the crisis, Ukrainian companies and develop appropriate anti-crisis solutions. In connection with this acute problem is to determine the characteristics and strategic respectively tactical crisis management and develop crisis toolstov in the system of corporate governance of Ukrainian companies. The obtained results determine the necessary methodological basis for improvement of the assessment of the severity of the crisis of Ukrainian companies and the formulation of appropriate anti-crisis solutions. Theoretical, methodical and applied results of research used in the process of crisis management of companies mining and metallurgical complex, shipbuilding and engineering industry of Ukraine.

J	Onyshchuk, Y				Onyshchuk, Yuliya			THE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OF THE SUGAR INDUSTRY IN THE CONTEXT OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION OF UKRAINE	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						sugar industry; sector; strategy; development; modernization; restructuring		The main problem of the Ukrainian economy today is the total loss of production potential. Losing production, the country becomes an outsider in the world economy, "falls out" of the system of international division of labour, giving leadership in the production of traditional goods for it to countries with lower benefits, but more civilized approach to production. One of these traditional products, which have always been "calling card" of Ukraine is sugar. Methodology. The basis for the study of the sugar industry, we have chosen a systematic approach, in which the industry is seen as complex, complete system structural elements, united by a common purpose. At the same time, then the sugar industry is food processing subsystem, part of the process and part of agriculture. Research industry as system and component of a higher order corresponds to the need to maximize the efficiency of its development. The development of the sugar industry in Ukraine should not be a simple transition from one system to another as and complex multifactorial process that represents the law of transition of quantitative changes in quality. Implementation of the main goal of the sugar industry in a dynamic environment is possible only if the selection and implementation of effective strategies must be built into the strategy of agricultural development and national economic strategy. Therefore, the subject of our research are theoretical and applied aspects of effective development of the sugar industry of Ukraine and the purpose of research - strategy development sector in terms of European integration. Results. Under the development strategy of the sugar industry, we understand the unique set of actions and decisions on how to achieve development with minimal energy system. We believe that the strategic goal should be a creation of modern, technically perfect, economically efficient and socially important sugar industry, able to produce competitive products, satisfy the full domestic demand for sugar, to ensure the formation of the state reserve and expand the export base. To achieve this, the industry has a number of assumptions that are regarded as its capabilities, as well as a number of restrictions that impede the development process can significantly influence the content of the strategy or the process of implementation and require removal. Together they form the strategic position of the sugar industry, which today we can characterize as extremely weak. Achieving strategic objective involves the development and implementation of a package of measures which we have divided into three areas: restructuring measures, technical and technological modernization of the industry, diversification of production activities and measures of organizational and economic modified sugar production. Value/originality. The implementation of the proposed measures will overcome the crisis on the first phase, on the second - stabilize production and create conditions for increasing it in the future and, finally, ensure economic growth in the long term.

While product variety is increasing, in parallel product life cycles are decreasing. Customers also expect custom features on products. To handle with all these compelling challenges; organizations try to guarantee that every action taken on operational and tactical levels are just for strategic goals. Influence on total product cost at early design phase is another way of coping. Strategic planning and integrated product and process design and development issues are considered together in this paper. A road map is developed which begins from generation of strategic goals and ends with selection of alternative concept design phase. Finally first part of this road map is implemented for a retail organization.

J	Pirta, R; Grabis, J				Pirta, Ruta; Grabis, Janis			Evaluation of Changes in Information Systems According to Enterprise Architecture Evolution Goals and Principles	BALTIC JOURNAL OF MODERN COMPUTING			English	Article						Enterprise Architecture; Change Management; Evolution strategy		Information systems (IS) are frequently modified according to changes in enterprise business and operating models and other internal and external factors that influence the enterprise. The changes are systematically managed following the engineering change management (ECM) process. The main issue in the ECM process is that the IS changes and their impact frequently are not evaluated with respect to the overall enterprise architecture (EA) and its evolution strategy. This paper proposes an approach for evaluation the changes with respect to EA. The proposed approach links aspects of operational change management and strategic EA management. The evaluation process is triggered by IS change requests, which are mapped to the current EA, multiple change request implementation scenarios are identified by analyzing relationships in the EA, and alignment of each scenario with EA evolution strategy is accessed using appropriate measures. An initial illustration of the approach is provided.

Strategic entrepreneurship and dynamic flexibility: Towards an integrative framework	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP			English	Article						Strategic Entrepreneurship; Dynamic Flexibility; Change	FIRM PERFORMANCE	Strategic entrepreneurship is a growing field within both Entrepreneurship and Management Science. Dynamic flexibility is a concept originally developed to resolve general business issues (Apter, 1985) and later enhanced to address specific strategic management challenges. Strategic Entrepreneurship deals with a singular strategic management response which is to achieve superior performance via simultaneous opportunity-seeking and advantage-seeking activities (Ireland, Hitt, & Simon, 2003). The process of maintaining superior performance is certainly a longitudinal one and requires capabilities on both those dimensions (Ireland & Webb, 2007). In this paper, we propose the use of dynamic flexibility as a useful capability to address strategic entrepreneurship longitudinal issue. By exploring the modulation time response model and different other references from both strategic management and strategic entrepreneurship literature, we aim to establish an integrative framework for dynamic strategic entrepreneurship.

J	Roghani, M				Roghani, Mehdi			Analysis of Relation between Model of Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and Organization Performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED BIOTECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						BSC; performance evaluation; excellence model; control		Intoday's competitive environment, the survival of enterprises depends on continuous improvement of performance in order to maintain and increase competitiveness and achieve higher profits. This is followed by setting goals, planning and therefore evaluation of the operation in order to be informed of the degree of success in achieving the predominated goals. Traditional methods of performance evaluation are mainly based on financial criteria and many of the effective qualitative criteria of the so called company is ignoring customer satisfaction. In this regard, the Balanced Scorecard and Excellence was introduced in the 1990s. Considering the importance and value creation The two organizations aim of this study was to assess the dimensions of the BSC model to improve the performance and excellence of Aghajari oil and gas exploitation company. Methods: This study aimed to analyze the relationship between the implementation model of balanced scorecard ( BSC) with the performance of companies operating in the Aghajari oil and gas in 2014. In this study, one main question and four sub-questions have been raised. The results of the questionnaire show that the compilation, implementation and enhancement the four aspects of the so called model and putting them in the organization bed helps the managers to line their strategic goal in the whole levels of the organization and ensure that all personels are aware of their long-termed business goals a and its realization strategy. The population of the study was 185 people top managers, middle, heads and experts of the company and due to the distribution of the functional units, number of samples have been taken and 125 people have been considered to be the main sample. Results: After explaining the survey it was found that 94 percent of the respondents regard the four BSC aspects to be important in the performance of ofAghajari oil and gas Exploitation Company,	[Roghani, Mehdi] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind Management, Omidiyeh Branch, Omidiyeh, Iran		Roghani, M (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind Management, Omidiyeh Branch, Omidiyeh, Iran.

J	Schweitzer, J				Schweitzer, Jochen			HOW CONTRACTS AND CULTURE MEDIATE JOINT TRANSACTIONS OF INNOVATION PARTNERSHIPS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Innovation partnerships; contracting; organisational culture	PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; INTERORGANIZATIONAL GOVERNANCE; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; UNITED-STATES; TRUST MATTER; PERFORMANCE; COOPERATION; COSTS	Although the literature suggests that matters of contracting and governance in strategic innovation partnerships are interrelated and that governance of partnerships generally occurs with contractual heterogeneity, our understanding about the specific relationships between contracting and the partnership culture that facilitates joint transactions is rather vague. In this study, we clarify how the complexity of contractual agreements between partners in conjunction with the alignment of their innovation objectives and the ambiguity inherent in their mutual contributions to the partnership can be used to predict the culture of the partnership. We find that innovation partnerships result to be one of four types: bureaucratic, market, clan, or adhocracy. Our result emphasises the central role of contractual complexity as a suitable and relevant concept to capture the nature of inter-organisational innovation partnerships.

J	Seneviratne, J				Seneviratne, Janaka			Path Ahead for Public Sector Engineers	ENGINEER-JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTION OF ENGINEERS SRI LANKA			English	Article						Administrative and Regulatory Systems; Systems View; Business Excellence Framework; Organisation Culture; Different Thinking		Sri Lanka is blessed with high calibre, technically competent engineers. However, the lack of proper administrative and regulatory systems in the country is cited as the main reason for the lacklustre performance of its public sector engineers. Engineers have to think differently, act more proactively and try out new processes and procedures to ensure that the organisations where they work are service centric and socially responsive. Public sector engineers have to be aware of their own limitations and should seek external guidance whenever necessary. Local engineers can make use of international concepts, methodologies, guidelines, codes of practice and tools towards this end. Strategic planning processes in the public sector organisations need radical changes. Engineers should apply the, systems view concept. holistically to assess the effectiveness of the management structure of their organisations. The organisational culture needs to be enriched with consultative decision making processes and teamwork. The Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka (IESL) has to act as a facilitator in this process. The ultimate aim should be to embrace business excellence elements to be an integral part of each organisation concerned.

The city was also European Cultural Capital by 2012 and in 2013 was European City of Sports. Currently, is running for European Green Capital 2020, being the Waste Production and Management (WPM) one of the strategic guideline. Taking into account the WPM policy and the city goals, a Municipality Strategic Waste Plan (2016-2025) (SWP), will be done. Guimaraes is considered to be a "diffuse territory", as it encompasses land use and economic activity development, leading to different scenarios. It is also important to notice that 1/3 of the Guimaraes population is located on the urban area. Under this context, the WPM across the Municipality will be directly affected by specific features of the urban population, and the correlation between several other variables shall be considered in a holistic approach comprising waste production characterization, land use, citizens socio demographic aspects and human resources. This project aims at presenting a first approach to the definition of the SWP, in the form of an integrated Roadmap of waste production, in a multi-disciplinary approach between the land use and the socio-demographic characteristics.

J	Sharma, S				Sharma, Sanjay			A unique index with the explicit cost related to forecast	JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Decision making; Operations management; Production; Inventory; Demand forecasts; Cost of forecasting; Total cost estimation	SUPPLY CHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE; FAMILY PRODUCTION CONTEXT; SHELF-LIFE; CYCLE TIME; INTERMITTENT; PERFORMANCE; EXCHANGE; MODEL	Purpose - The present paper aims to draw an attention towards the inclusion of forecast related costs. Its main purpose is to initiate a new line of research/practice including the forecasting expenditure. Design/methodology/approach - After a relevant review of supply chain/procurement/production planning related literature, it has been observed that the existing work lacks an explicit inclusion of the cost concerned with forecast. The increased cost of forecasting is expected to enhance the forecasting accuracy. At a higher level, product family is considered for the analysis. However, a basic unit of analysis is always a single item production/procurement situation. Therefore, this situation has been discussed analytically with the use of the fundamental equations and an explicit inclusion of forecasting cost for the first time in the relevant literature. Numerous practical applications have been discussed at strategic and operational level. A framework is also presented for future research in this area. Findings - A specific contribution of the present paper is an approach towards a unique index for relative forecasting expenditure. The suggested index will be useful for comparison purpose. Also, it can be used as a benchmark that can be improved in future. Practical implications - The case is explained when cycle time is invariant after discussing the other potential applications. Usefulness of the proposed methodology and the index is discussed for the business organizations operating independently or in the supply chains. Originality/value - On the basis of the forecast, a production or procurement plan is generated in many of the industrial or business situations. In the context of supply chain/production/inventory management, focus is more on demand forecasting techniques or generation of the forecasts in the existing literature. However, the increased costs concerning forecasts are expected to provide more accurate prediction. Therefore, the originality lies in an inclusion of forecast related costs.

There may be various models or approaches to energy management (EM). However, strategic EM and its applications are still away from achieving their goals. In this regard, the main objectives of the present study are to design, develop and propose a knowledge framework primarily based on an EM concept map for a holistic EM. Aligned with the research purposes, a qualitative four-phase study was conducted, and the research question was formulated as: 'What would be the components and concepts required for the holistic EM?' The study also integrated systematic literature review (SLR) and focus group discussion (FGD) techniques. Initially, a list of the key EM concepts was formed and a preliminary concept map was constructed. Then, the final version of the concept map was achieved through several iterative revisions and FGDs. This concept map may be seen as a complementary and contributory tool for strategy development and decision-making processes in the EM knowledge domain. It is hoped that the study may extend the previous knowledge both by the tools it has utilised and approaches it has adopted for the holistic EM	[Sogut, M.

While transactional IT systems contribute to process efficiencies, informational IT systems generate insights and contribute to informational benefits. We argue that the complementary interactions between these two classes of IT systems can support both informed and efficient processes and lead to greater business value. We use systems theory to develop a research model, which includes the complementary interactions between transactional and informational IT systems and the emergence of higher-order IT-enabled business systems. The two IT systems interact and augment other business systems to create higher-order emergent IT-enabled business systems. Emergent IT-enabled business systems lead to transactional, informational and strategic benefits. The paper concludes by calling for empirical studies that focus on the complementary relations between transactional and informational IT systems and their impact on business value.

J	Svitovyi, O				Svitovyi, Olexander			THE GRAIN PRODUCTS SUBCOMPLEX OF AGRO INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX OF UKRAINE: STRATEGY OF VALUE ADDED MANAGEMENT	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						grain products subcomplex; value added; strategic management; grain processing; profit		The purpose of the paper is substantiation of ways to improve strategic value added management of grain products subcomplex of Ukraine agro-industrial complex. Methodology. The study is based on the monographic method and the use of statistical information to confirm the conclusion that the management strategy of value added can be the basis for the development of grain products subcomplex. Results showed that one of the strategic objectives of grain products subcomplex is the growth of production through the introduction of resource-saving technologies, as well as the export of products with high added value. Within the grain products subcomplex special attention should be paid to vertical and horizontal integration. Integration in grain products subcomplex AIC of Ukraine, so and cooperation, will contribute to increase added value and does not require intermediaries. To achieve greater added value in grain products subcomplex, an important role should play the strategy development at the state level. State regulation of this process should be based on improving tax and customs legislation in relation to the industries of grain products subcomplex, as well as involves: an increase in state support of grain producers and processing industries; increase of government order and stabilizing of purchase prices; partial indemnification and reduction of prices of the purchased resources; expansion of leasing and others like that. Practical implication. The correct choice of strategy in value added management in a grain products subcomplex will provide AIC of Ukraine the intensive development. It will be instrumental in transfer of agro-industrial production from raw material in production with a high value added. Value/originality. This study will help to better understand the conditions and factors that influence the increase of value added in the grain products subcomplex AIC of Ukraine in the strategic aspect.

J	Van Der Waldt, G				Van Der Waldt, Gerrit			Probing strategy-project alignment: The case of the South African Social Security Agency	TD-THE JOURNAL FOR TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IN SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article								Public institutions, such as the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) increasingly function in multi-project environments to translate strategies successfully into service-delivery initiatives. However, this 'projectification' often causes projects to be designed and executed haphazardly. This can lead to budget and schedule overruns, and the general wastage of an organisation's resources. Project failures often occur where organisations do not ensure that specific projects are aligned with their core strategies. The purpose of this article is to combine the theories and principles of organisation, management, strategic management, and project management in an effort to pinpoint core determinants that can help establish the extent to which an organisation manages the alignment of its strategic projects. In the present study, the author applied the principles of interdisciplinarity, systems thinking, and organisational integration. The combined core determinants that were uncovered were then used in an empirical investigation of SASSA. The purpose of this investigation is to identify particular challenges the organisation faces in aligning their strategies and projects successfully. Thereafter, a number of recommendations follow to address these challenges.

J	Vyrkovsky, AV				Vyrkovsky, Andrei V.			THEORETICAL ASPECTS OF MEDIA MANAGEMENT: BASIC APPROACHES AND PROBLEM AREAS	THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES OF JOURNALISM			Russian	Article						Theory; concepts; media management; problem areas; research	CULTURE; FUTURE; NEWS	The article presents the scrupulous analysis of theories in media management field. The author explores the main approaches to media management (strategic and newsroom ones) and marks their advantages and disadvantages. Basic definitions and terms in media management discourse have been clarified. On the basis of current meta-research of media management the author states that the most widely spread theories in scholar discourse are the strategic management ones. The main problem areas being important both for theory and practice have been detected. Particularly the author points out the lack of research on the journalists' labor given the spread of convergence. The author concludes that the development of model presenting the process of journalistic text creation could be extremely important.

In this context, this paper analyses the effectiveness of VOC reduction policies, namely pollution charges and environmental taxes at the national and industrial sector levels. It uses a computable general equilibrium model, which connects macroeconomic variables with VOC emissions inventory, to simulate the effects of policy scenarios (with 2007 as the reference year). This paper shows that VOC emissions are reduced by 2.2% when a pollution charge equal to the average cost of engineering reduction methods - the traditional approach to regulation in China - is applied. In order to achieve a similar reduction, an 8.9% indirect tax would have to be imposed. It concludes that an environmental tax should be the preferred method of VOC regulation due to its smaller footprint on the macroeconomy. Other policies, such as subsidies, should be used as supplements.

J	Winslett, G				Winslett, Greg			The struggle to satisfy need: exploring the institutional cues for teaching support staff	JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Discourse analysis; strategic planning; teaching and learning support	HIGHER-EDUCATION; LEADERSHIP	The decision-making around resource allocation in universities is complex. It plays out through the structures of governance and bureaucracy, through interactions with colleagues, workplace cultures and through day-to-day individual work practices. To survive and succeed within this complex environment, teaching support staff need to be sensitive to the cues provided by their institution. This paper focuses on the cues available to teaching support staff within university strategic plans and considers the effects these cues may have on their day-to-day decision-making. The results provide a sample of the competing cues that have an impact on teaching support staff and provide a foundation for a reconsidered approach to university strategic planning.

J	Yao, YH; Li, DY				Yao, Yihong; Li, Dongya			The Hong Kong Jockey Club: Driving Sustainability and Riding High Together - A Case Study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Hong Kong Jockey Club; sustainability governance; sustainability practice; sustainability innovation; carbon footprint; supplier sustainability; stakeholder engagement; case study	MANAGEMENT; GREEN	In recent years, sustainability has become a popular topic for both business and society. There is little dispute that companies and organizations have increasingly paid attention to social and environmental issues, and thus sustainability has come under the spotlight. However, The Hong Kong Jockey Club ("HKJC" or "the Club"), the largest single taxpayer and non-government charitable donor in Hong Kong, has been paying attention to environmental and social issues for decades although its "sustainability efforts" were not given a label for most of that period. The year of 2009 was a milestone of the HKJC's sustainability endeavors as in this year the HKJC formed its first Sustainability Committee, raising sustainability to the strategic level within the Club. The first sustainability report of HKJC was released in 2011, making the HKJC's dialogue with the community, also within the Club, transparent. In 2014, the Club introduced Supplier Sustainability Guidelines, aiming to increase the sustainability standards of the Club's business partners, and in turn, of all local businesses. This case depicts how HKJC achieved sustainability through its endeavors in the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) areas, thus contributing to the community and enabling a better future for its stakeholders and for society as a whole. This case also discusses the evolution of the HKJC's sustainability governance structure and strategy, the progress of HKJC's sustainability practices from 2009 to 2016, and HKJC's sustainability challenges.

Seismic retrofitting can significantly reduce earthquake damages to the built environment and thus decrease the risk posing to the public and the community. However, many countries with active seismic zones, including New Zealand, experience slow progress of seismic retrofit. This paper examines the decision environment which has significant impact on stakeholders' behaviours, to identify challenges in seismic rehabilitation decision-making. A qualitative approach was adopted with semi-structured interviews. A selection of building owners, government officials, and practical professionals involved in seismic retrofitting decision-making were interviewed. Major challenges identified by the interview results include various options, diverse considerations, assorted stakeholders, conflicting multiple objectives, and unaided decision making process. The inconsistency in expectation of whether building owners have sufficient aid in decision-making process offers plausible explanation regarding the key impediment to successful seismic rehabilitation decisions. A decision-making model is thus a necessity to assist building owners making an informed decision.

Although researchers have pointed out various issues and aspects of a construction project's delivery process that can significantly affect its environmental impact, the extent to which these issues can influence the total environmental impact of the project is unclear. The current research aims to investigate and eventually quantify the influence of a number of such parameters, utilizing an existing steel-framed building as the basis for the necessary calculations. The conclusions drawn illustrate the actual extent of the influence of the examined life cycle parameters, while also offering specific insight in regard to the determination of criteria that can be used as the basis for recommendations for similar projects.

J	Austin, IP				Austin, Ian Patrick			Becoming a Wealth Management Centre and International Relations Implications: The Singapore Policy Approach and Global and Regional Responses	JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE			English	Article								Singapore's strategic play to secure international wealth management market share has been very successful. Serious questions, however, were raised in relation to this ascendency as the Global Financial Crisis (GFC, beginning in 2007) drove the European Union (EU) and the United States of America (US) to become proactive in clamping down on tax evasion and other areas deemed by them to be undesirable within the international financial system. This paper will examine the Singapore government's decade-long growth policy of its wealth management sector, and how it has been impacted upon by international regulatory responses. Further, it examines how in stark contrast to the EU and the US, Indonesia has been far less successful in its diplomatic efforts to have Singapore address financial diplomacy issues (tax evasion and ill-gotten gains from corruption) in relation to Indonesian citizens residing in Singapore. This article will argue, however, that Singapore's less than robust response to Indonesia's constant requests for action maybe to the long-term detriment of Singapore itself. Economics is now a large part of foreign policy.

J	Cahalane, C				Cahalane, Conor			Combining 2D Mapping and Low Density Elevation Data in a GIS for GNSS Shadow Prediction	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION			English	Article						GNSS shadowing; GNSS prediction; mobile surveys; viewshed	LOCALIZATION	The number of satellites visible to a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver is important for high accuracy surveys. To aid with this, there are software packages capable of predicting GNSS visibility at any location of the globe at any time of day. These prediction packages operate by using regularly updated almanacs containing positional data for all navigation satellites; however, one issue that restricts their use is that most packages assume that there are no obstructions on the horizon. In an attempt to improve this, certain planning packages are now capable of modelling simple obstructions whereby portions of the horizon visible from one location can be blocked out, thereby simulating buildings or other vertical structures. While this is useful for static surveys, it is not applicable for dynamic surveys when the GNSS receiver is in motion. This problem has been tackled in the past by using detailed, high-accuracy building models and designing novel methods for modelling satellite positions using GNSS almanacs, which is a time-consuming and costly approach. The solution proposed in this paper is to use a GIS to combine existing, freely available GNSS prediction software to predict pseudo satellite locations, incorporate a 2.5D model of the buildings in an area created with national mapping agency 2D vector mapping and low density elevation data to minimise the need for a full survey, thereby providing savings in terms of cost and time. Following this, the ESRI ArcMap viewshed tool was used to ascertain what areas exhibit poor GNSS visibility due to obstructions over a wide area, and an accuracy assessment of the procedure was made.

J	Ferraro, G; Martell, M				Ferraro, Gianluca; Martell, Meritxell			Radioactive Waste Management and Public Participation in the EU Lessons Learnt from the EURATOM Research Framework Programmes	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								Since 2000, the EURATOM Framework Programmes have dedicated political attention and economic support to public participation in radioactive waste management (RWM). Although a one-fit-all solution for a participatory RVVM does not exist, the diversity that characterizes the European Union (EU) offers a relevant pool of knowledge and experience. The Joint Research Centre has used the knowledge and experience cumulated by relevant EURATOM projects to define a list of general principles for a more participatory approach to RWM. The principles explained in this article can ultimately work as indications for the changes and strategic actions that are needed for a better RVVM in the EU.

J	Gibbons, P; Scott, PS; Mac Fhionnlaoich, C				Gibbons, Patrick; Scott, Pamela Sharkey; Mac Fhionnlaoich, Cormac			Strategic management: A perspective on the development of the field of strategic management and the contribution of the Irish Journal of Management	IRISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategy; structure; resource base view		This paper analyses the progress made in the field of strategic management over the past three decades. One approach to analysing a discipline's trajectory is to explore its exemplary research. We review the papers awarded the Dan and Mary Lou Schendel, Strategic Management Society (SMS) Best Paper Award of the Strategic Management Journal (SMJ) since 1993, to demonstrate the emergence of strategic management as a specific discipline with a distinct view of how firms generate competitive advantage. Our paper interprets the development of the discipline from its market-based and structural roots to attempts to decipher the 'black box' of the organisation in analysing capabilities, particularly dynamic capabilities, and resources. Our study shows how the conceptual breakthroughs of the exemplary papers are further developed by the field through theory testing and extension using increasingly sophisticated methodologies published by journals such as Irish Journal Of Management (IJM). Our review of both journals highlights that despite increasing market, social and cultural instability since these seminal papers were first conceived, their lessons are still relevant and increasingly critical to both theory and practice in establishing the future trajectory for strategic management and a framework for organisations to compete.

J	Kasahara, T				Kasahara, Tetsuya			Strategic Technology Adoption Under Dispersed Information and Information Learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Technology adoption; informational externality; learning; strategic delay; herding	REAL OPTIONS; UNCERTAINTY; INVESTMENT; PREEMPTION; DELAY; MODEL; FADS	In this paper, we analyze the technology adoption problem of firms when relevant information about a new technology is dispersed among them. Developing a continuous time model in which imperfectly and differently informed multiple firms determine strategically when to adopt a new technology, we show that the phenomena of an economically inefficient initial delay of adoption, a staggered adoption, and an inefficiently early mass adoption can arise in equilibrium, particularly in the form of strategic delay, informational learning, and herding behavior, respectively. We also address the incentive scheme that helps to achieve efficient collective adoption of the new technology under dispersed information and show under what conditions, if any, such an incentive scheme can work well.

Consequently, this will be the cause of delays to offer the strategic assistance, and to provide water and food, etc. In order to solve the problem of re-establishing communication infrastructure to allow for information gathering, we developed an ad hoc mobile communications network for disaster-struck areas using ZigBee. As the communication speed of ZigBee is low, we propose a problem-specific image compression method for the multimedia data visualization. By using the proposed method combined with GPS information, it is possible to quickly grasp the damage situation in the region.

J	Sethi, SA; Hollmen, T				Sethi, Suresh Andrew; Hollmen, Tuula			Conceptual Models for Marine and Freshwater Systems in Alaska: Flexible Tools for Research Planning, Prioritization and Communication	ARCTIC			English	Article						baleen whales; Chinook salmon; ecological modeling; herring; strategic planning; systems models	BAYESIAN BELIEF NETWORKS; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; ECOLOGICAL MODELS; DECISION-MAKING; MENTAL MODELS; MANAGEMENT; FISHERIES; CHALLENGES; RESTORATION; METHODOLOGY	Conceptual ecological models synthesize information about complex systems into simplified visual maps and can be used to prioritize system components for research or management attention. In this article, we introduce conceptual modeling methods that incorporate expert ratings about a suite of properties of system components, including assessment of the state of knowledge, the strength of ecological impact, and the state of management or research attention devoted to a given component. Quantitative ratings of the properties of system components are subsequently used to prioritize model components objectively for research or management attention. Two case studies, one on plankton-herring-baleen whale dynamics and one on Chinook salmon strategic research planning, are presented to illustrate techniques. For example, in the Chinook salmon case study, participants constructed a prioritization score that identified system components rated as high ecological impact, but low state of knowledge and low state of management or research attention. By addressing gaps in both knowledge and attention, participants implemented a strategy for research planning that complemented existing Chinook salmon research and management in the study region. The case studies demonstrated that conceptual ecological models could be completed successfully with an economy of time. Conceptual modeling has been implemented across a range of disciplines and provides a useful tool that natural resource management and research groups can use to organize collaborative efforts and communicate research-or management progress to stakeholders or funders.

J	Shanmugam, G; Sankar, AMG				Shanmugam, Gowri; Sankar, Anandha Mala Ganapathy			Strategic enhancement of the collaborative framework for novelty in retrieval from digital textual data corpus by deploying DPSC and RBWM algorithms for forensic analysis	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH			English	Article						Data management; document clustering; Google's Crawler; preprocessing; semantic	NETWORKS; SEARCH	This paper proposes two advanced algorithms embedded into an integrated system; one is a Dynamic Path Selection Clustering (DPSC) algorithm for the document clustering and the other is the Rearward Binary Window Match (RBWM) algorithm for the user's search engine. The DPSC algorithm is derived from the concept of Google's crawler technique implemented in offline processing and the RBWM algorithm for search engine is derived by utilizing the techniques of other search algorithms. The proposed system is being accomplished for giving an appropriate data structure to the input dataset content. The dataset used as input is the Enron dataset, which is large in volume and unstructured. The system is designed with the help of integrating all the individual and independent units into a system by bringing them under one frame and the units are data preprocessing, document clustering, mapping of clusters and search engine. This system, with fine refining integrated frame, would likely evidence in a better way, since simple definition of the system for data retrieval affects the consistency of irrelevant information retrieval for evidencing to be increased. Though there are plenty of existing systems in forensic department with only simple definition of search engines, without any other processes the irrelevancy in retrieval is seen to a larger extent. Consequently, a design of this integrated system, which is automated in process by using the above well defined configured units, is proposed. This systematic approach is for adequate use of digital textual evidences, which assists in quicker crime identification rate. The outcomes of the proposed system are analyzed by obtaining the precision and recall values and comparing them with the results of Metasearch engines like Dogpile and Metacrawler, to test the efficacy in retrieval rate.

Evaluating vulnerability of critical state park infrastructure caused by extreme weather events: A tennessee application	RISK MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						risk management; vulnerability assessment; climate change adaptation; facility risk management		Infrastructure systems, including public lands managed by park authorities, are central to the economic, environmental, and cultural functioning of our society. Understanding the likelihood and impacts to system components from extreme weather events can be fundamental to prudent strategic, operational and financial decision making. This article describes the development and implementation of a methodology for evaluating the vulnerability of various types of critically identified infrastructure located within the Tennessee State Parks system to future extreme weather events. The methodology calculates a vulnerability score for each combination of type of infrastructure and weather event based on historical and anticipated weather events, and infrastructure performance when exposed to these events. It was found that hydrologic events, strong thunderstorm winds, and winter storms are the extreme weather events that pose the greatest risk to critical infrastructure within Tennessee State Parks. Locations that are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events include Shelby, Wilson, Dickson, Pickett, Carter, Putnam, Hamilton, Sullivan and Union counties. The approach described in this article is applicable to other park systems as well as public sector assets in general.

J	Chongthawonsatid, S				Chongthawonsatid, Sukanya			MEDICAL RECORDS MANAGEMENT OF FOREIGN PATIENTS IN THAI BORDER HOSPITALS	JOURNAL OF HEALTH RESEARCH			English	Article						Medical records management; Information technology; Foreign patients; Thai border hospitals		Background: Thailand has become a destination for medical tourism for many people from ASEAN countries and elsewhere. Thailand's international borders are shared with Cambodia, Malaysia, Laos and Myanmar; consequently, people from these neighboring countries, many of whom are economic migrants, are treated in Thai hospitals. Their information may not be completely and accurately represented in these medical records and statistics. Methods: Questionnaires were sent to 345 selected hospitals; including 30 general hospitals and 315 community hospitals. Data were collected from two staff members in participating general and community hospitals including the chief of medical records and the staff member responsible for medical information technology. The response rate of the questionnaires returned to the researcher was 56% and included 19 general hospitals and 175 community hospitals yielding, a total 194 participating hospitals. Respondents returned questionnaires to the researcher through the post. The data collected examined administration and management, problems that focused on medical records and medical information technology related to foreign patients. Results: The study demonstrated that the primary problems with medical records for almost foreign patients from countries that border on Thailand included: a lack of a standard registration process, having incomplete data, poor communication, low language skills, inability to pay, and the absence of a foreigner medical records management policy. Conclusions: The recommendations for developing and managing medical records are as follows: 1) Hospitals where there are many foreign patients should have a foreigner medical records management policy and a strategic plan to develop a medical records system, that includes a registration form (available in several languages), separate counter services, and a separate medical records collection zone. 2) All hospitals should have standard registration process that is supported by an appropriate and responsive computer program for foreign patients. 3) Border hospitals need to be prepared to serve people from other Asian countries. This service includes planning, organizing, directing, monitoring and evaluation control, healthcare worker allocation, budget, materials, and equipment. 4) Healthcare workers need to focus on gathering the patients' histories by asking for their actual name, surname, parent's names, occupation, address, telephone number, and identification number.

To determine what stakeholders perceive as barriers and facilitators to creating a national public health observatory (PHO) in Trinidad and Tobago. Methods. A descriptive study was conducted based on 15 key informant interviews carried out from April to September 2013. The key informants worked within the health care sector in Trinidad and Tobago. Using a semi-structured interview guide, information was collected on knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about creating a PHO; barriers and facilitators to creating and sustaining a PHO; legal considerations; and human resource and information technology requirements. Common themes of the responses were identified. Results. The majority of participants supported the development of a national PHO, recognized its value in informing their work, and indicated that a national PHO could 1) provide information to support evidence-informed decision-making for health policy and strategic planning; 2) facilitate data management by establishing data policies, procedures, and standards; 3) increase the use of data by synthesizing and disseminating information; and 4) provide data for benchmarking. However, a number of barriers were identified, including 1) the perception that data collection is not valued; 2) untimely availability of data; 3) limited data synthesis, dissemination, and utilization to inform decision-making; and 4) challenges related to the allocation of human resources and existing information technology. Conclusions. Key informants support the development of a national PHO in Trinidad and Tobago. The findings align well within the components of the conceptual framework for establishing national health observatories. A stepwise approach to establishing a national PHO in Trinidad and Tobago, beginning with structural components and followed by functional components, is recommended. A national PHO in Trinidad and Tobago could serve as a model for other countries in the Caribbean.

Purpose of this study was to provide a conceptual model of metropolises waste management in Tehran, capital of Iran, as a model. Data collection was done through a 25-items questionnaire to examine the people awareness and attitude as well as analyze current and desired situations of wastes management and recycling in 2013. Four hundred fifty residents of Tehran were selected randomly to participate in the study.. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics methods by SPSS software and P < 0.05 was set as the significance level. The SWOT matrix was used to formulate waste management strategies considering all aspects of comprehensive waste management. Results showed that the awareness level of 90.4% of people was good and the attitude of 81.3% of them was supportive towards recycling. Moreover, more media coverage on this issue and using award and encouragement strategies are the most important factors increasing people participation in the waste management. Furthermore based on the quantitative strategic planning matrix, priorities of waste management strategies are sustainable, social, economic, and environmental development.

All these parties are legally connected by contractual arrangements, and covenants among all interest parties are important. However, a comprehensive study on designing covenants among parties in a buyout deal to achieve commitment and avoid risk in closing a deal is seldom seen in current literature. By investigating one of the world's largest buyout deals - the acquisition of Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), this paper not only probes into the design of contracts and covenant, but also provides several managerial implications. This paper concludes that well-designed covenants in buy-out deals can appropriately align all participants' diversified interests.

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS TOOLS APPLICATION AT SMALL & MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES IN ECUADOR	INDEPENDENT JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & PRODUCTION			English	Article						Strategic Analysis Tools; SME; Formulation; Competitiveness; Value		This article explores the nature and scope of Strategic Analysis Tools (SAT) application in SMEs1 (Small and medium-sized Enterprises) located in emerging countries such as Ecuador (where there are no formal studies on the subject). It is intended to assess which of them may contribute to formulate strategic options and create awareness of relevant risks or distress specifically about continuity concerning their operations. Through the application of a survey to an intentional sample-selection of SMEs in Quito-Ecuador, we analyzed the consciousness about these instruments to facilitate the creation of strategic options, their contribution to assess their competitive position and their interaction with the improvement of other capabilities to let them possibly achieve superior performance. Our conclusion is that SMEs can take advantage of exploiting SAT by systematically considering relevant variables in order to assess their current and future possibilities to outperform competition. On the other hand, the identification of which strategic factors these firms should pursue and its constant monitoring can help building sustainable advantages. Cultural barriers and unconsciousness of their benefits may explain their low usage rates. This is a qualitative investigation and the research design is transversal but not experimental.

J	Avlasko, ZA				Avlasko, Zamira A.			THE CHOICE OF A BUSINESS MODEL AS A PLATFORM FOR THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROCESS APPROACH	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						business processes; business model; management of market behavior; process approach; agro-industrial complex		The global market is pushing our country to build a strong domestic production sector. Russian agricultural sector develops unsteadily, and occupies only 1.5 % of the world's agricultural production. Experts estimate the losses and profits in the sector as 2570 billion dollars per annum and forecast a slowdown in the coming years. The possibility of rapid growth in the sector is almost exhausted. Experience of large agricultural enterprises shows that an important factor in increasing the effectiveness is market behavior management and efficient use of resources. In this situation the enterprise management system must undergo significant changes, and it is necessary to use modern methods to enhance manageability. The practice of implementation of the process approach in Russia shows that there is a need for a focus on the better efficiency of the enterprise in the market. To do this, an important step is to create a balanced business model which, in a subsequent period, will be reflected by modeling tools in regulatory documentation. In general terms, the scheme of the process approach implementation will consist of several stages: 1) analysis of the internal and external environment; 2) audit of the current business model; 3) development or adjustment of the business model; 4) choice of the method for business modeling; 5) development of an implementation plan; 6) implementation of the project. At the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to the completeness and adequacy of research because it is the basis for making strategic decisions. Based on the information gathered during the development, it is necessary to ensure the application of approaches, new or unused by competitors, to the organization of the key areas (supply chain, relationships with competitors, key resources, production management, product, company management, unique benefits, sales and promotion, product availability, formation of loyalty to the product and translated values). Because of the nature of agricultural enterprises, the introduction of the process approach to the management of market behavior will ensure systematic improvement of the enterprise's sustainability to external market factors, improve the quality of supply chain management and provide effective feedback from the consumer market. Structuring of market behavior management will also give a significant boost to the development of new production chains, inter- regional and cluster structures, which will significantly increase the efficiency of the whole agricultural sector.

Economic evaluation on fish production and demand in Tripura - strategic options	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Demand elasticity; Demand estimation; Production elasticity; Strategy formulation; Technical efficiency	HOUSEHOLD DEMAND; CHINA	Tripura, witnessed an impressive growth in fish production during the past decade, because here fish culture is recognized as a vital activity for economic development. The state is presently undergoing a transitional phase and developing several plans to achieve self-sufficiency in fish production. The present study aims to workout strategic options that harmonize production and consumption. Stochastic frontier production function and technical efficiency of fish production estimates yielded positive coefficients for majority of factors of production. It showed significantly higher mean technical efficiency for adopted villages than that for non-adopted villages. At consumption front, demand estimation using multiple budgeting framework of household showed significant and positive income elasticities of demand for local carps, local non-carps, inter-state non-carps and small weed fish. But income elasticity for inter-state carps was less and insignificant among all selected choice fish groups (CFGs). Demand for the fish under the baseline scenario (base year 2004) is likely to grow at an annual rate of 3.38% for the State. The demand for fish by 2015 was projected as 80,153 mt of which nearly 50% (40,624 mt) is constituted by local carps. The study suggested prioritizing technological and management options after synchronizing present policy of the fisheries development, institutional environment, support services and profile of different stakeholders of the state.

The research is conducted as an in-depth case study in a large, multinational manufacturing and service company. The case reveals that improving IT governance practices is not sufficient to achieve high alignment, when the understanding of strategic value of IT is lacking. Improved alignment would require that IT is perceived as a strategic function in the organization and the IT governance treated accordingly. Bringing business and IT socially and culturally closer to each other is also required, but improving alignment on the social and cultural dimensions is dependent on the existence of the strategic direction: achieving alignment is difficult without common objectives between business and IT people. In general, the study illustrates limited impact of IT governance practices on alignment without requisite strategic direction.

Developing a plan for dealing with such problems reduces the impact of unexpected risks and failures while prioritizing risks draws attention, efforts and resources to the risks with great impact on projects success. The aim of this paper, is to identify the critical risk factors in an ERP project through a case study of a successful implementation of an ERP system in a Sudanese organization and to understand how the organization implemented the appropriate controls to minimize its business risks impact. To achieve this objective, a number of key articles were reviewed and analyzed to understand the different critical risk factors influence ERP implementation. New risk factors and controls influence ERP implementation have been identified. A new model of ERP implementation critical risk factors was developed. Furthermore, the risk factors were classified into categories, probability, impact and proximity, then using a prioritizing tool, the results of this study contributes to risks identification and prioritization by pointing to the less priority and the most critical risk factors.

Transportation and its drivers are comparable to the blood in the body of a creature named city. Based on a modern definition, a city is deprived of necessary functions without an efficient transportation system. Identify the different aspects of transport, particularly public transport play significant roles in achieving the objectives of a city. This identification requires knowledge of various aspects of urban transportation. The present study as an exploratory and descriptive survey aimed at identifying the internal and external dimensions of the transportation in Saqqez city. In this study, by a holistic view, different internal (strengths and weaknesses) and external (opportunities and threats) dimensions are identified, and by using strategic management techniques, necessary guidelines and strategies are proposed for improving the current situation governing the transport system in Saqqez city.

Wind tunnel study of odor impact and air ventilation assessments for relocating sewage treatment works to caverns	JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS			English	Article						Odor impact assessment; Air ventilation assessment; Wind tunnel testing; Sewage treatment works; Underground development	PEDESTRIAN-LEVEL WINDS; HIGH-DENSITY CITIES; HYDROGEN-SULFIDE; TREATMENT PLANTS; URBAN AREA; ENVIRONMENT; DISPERSION; BUILDINGS; GUIDELINES; CONSTRUCTION	In recent years, the topicality of environment-related issues has been frequently emphasized in terms of sustainability and the better management of development in harmony with the environment. As for Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated cities, the scarcity of land has always been assumed as a major impediment for its long-term development Therefore, the Hong Kong government actively explores approaches to enhance usable land resources. One viable approach is rock cavern development. This paper presents a feasibility assessment of relocating a sewage treatment works to a cavern, with emphasis on the evaluation of environmental sustainability. Wind tunnel tests were carried out with efforts to estimate the prospective odor impact, as well as the wind availability at pedestrian level. It is noted that the sewage odor concentration depends greatly on the dispersion distance and the surrounding topography. The results indicate that when the sewage treatment works is relocated to the cavern, the predicted odor concentration will not cause damage to human health as long as the ventilation shaft is properly placed. In addition, the air ventilation assessments were conducted for both before/after the planned building development. It shows that the new building development at the current plant site will not significantly influence the wind availability at pedestrian level in the surrounding areas. This paper highlights the importance of sustainable development in connection with the environment, and shows that rock cavern development can be an attractive alternative for strategic urban planning in Hong Kong.

Nevertheless, there are other aspects to be considered for the full utilization of the lean supply practices. Among those, the proximity tries to improve the liaison between the client and its provider of materials and components as a possible response to an increasing competitiveness level. To explore this subject this work had the objective of evaluating the determinant factors that could possibly explain the partial relocation of a manufacturing facility to create proximity conditions with one of its clients. For that purpose, a case study was developed in which a Brazilian auto parts manufacturing company belonging to the first tier of the automotive supply chain was considered. Because of such study, it was possible to conclude that the strategic advantages resulting from the proximity overpassed the conventional reasoning of considering financial gains as a key factor to justify such a decision. In fact, the cost savings obtained with the plant relocation were not enough to justify the investment made.

J	Garcia, VV; Vicente, EJF; Aragones, LU				Valencia Garcia, Victoriano; Fernandez Vicente, Eugenio J.; Usero Aragones, Luis			Cloud Management and Governance: Adapting IT Outsourcing to External Provision of Cloud-Based IT Services	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Cloud computing; IT governance; IT management; Outsourcing; IT service; Maturity model	SUCCESS	Outsourcing is a strategic option which complements IT services provided internally in organizations. The maturity model for IT service outsourcing (henceforth MM-2GES) is a new holistic maturity model based on standards ISO/IEC 20000 and ISO/IEC 38500, and the frameworks and best practices of ITIL and COBIT, with a specific focus on IT outsourcing. MM-2GES allows independent validation, practical application, and an effective transition to a model of good governance and management of outsourced IT services. Cloud computing is a new model for provisioning and consuming IT services on a need and pay-per-use basis. This model allows the IT systems to be more agile and flexible. The external provision of cloud-based services as part of Cloud computing appears as an evolution of traditional outsourcing, due to the emerging technologies related to the provision of IT services. As a result of technological developments, traditional outsourcing and external provision of cloud-based services, share common characteristics, but there are also some differences. This paper adapts MM-2GES to external provision of cloud-based services, from the point of view of the customer. This way, the applicability of the model can be implemented in organizations that have both models traditional IT outsourcing and cloud-based services provided externally, in order to achieve excellence in governance and management of all kind of IT services provided externally to organizations.

Today, thermal coal generates over 40 per cent of global electricity and is available in large quantities in countries such as China, India and the USA. Thermal coal is also the primary contributor to CO2 emissions, a substantial driver of climate change. This has resulted in material tension for 'sustainable and responsible' institutional investors and strategic challenges for certain state-owned companies. Deciding upon the electricity generation technology in which to invest poses a significant dilemma. Thermal coal is abundant and by far the cheapest when externalities are not internalized. Electric renewables currently suffer from intermittency, viable storage solutions and are not very scalable. While cleaner than thermal coal, natural gas is abundant yet often needs to be imported and is more expensive than thermal coal. Although safe, scalable and clean from an emissions perspective, 'new' nuclear energy suffers from perception problems. The mixed method inductive methodology was used to determine the extent to which thermal coal remains investable over the next 20 years and has led to two divergent yet plausible scenarios impacting thermal coal investability. In assessing the investability of thermal coal across four chief stakeholders and geographies, a multifaceted interpretation of the term 'investability' is developed, which recognizes disparate financial and non-financial investment drivers. The research shows that thermal coal remains investable by a variety of stakeholders, particularly in the Transformative scenario, but their reasons for investing differ materially both by geography and the type of stakeholder. Finally, the key drivers for both scenarios are identified that can be monitored and used as an early warning system to inform investment decisions.

JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Learning; War of attrition; Delay; Incomplete information	CONTINUOUS-TIME; STRATEGIC EXPERIMENTATION; ATTRITION; GAMES; WAR; INFORMATION	This paper uses a continuous-time war of attrition model to investigatethow learning about private payoffs affects delays in reaching agreement. At each point in time, players may receive a private Poisson signal that completely reveals the concession payoff to be high (good-news learning) or low (bad-news learning). In the good-news model, the expected delay is always non-monotonic in the learning rate: an increase in the learning rate prolongs delay in agreement if the learning rate is sufficiently low. In the bad-news model, numerical examples suggest learning prolongs delay as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A Consensus of Thought in Applying Change Management to Information System Environments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEM MODELING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Change Management; COBIT; Configuration Management; Internal Audit; Patch Management		Failure to keep pace with rapid developments in information technology can subject an organization to inefficiencies in obtaining reliable information that is imperative in making important decisions. The concept of change management attempts to move organizations in an efficient manner toward a desirable future state. In the realm of information processing, there is a continuing development of thought as to an appropriate framework to cover a vast array of issues from patching a specific software application to changing an overall system to better meet the strategic issues of an organization's environment. This article considers related guidance provided in a Global Technology Audit Guide (GTAG) from The Institute of Internal Auditors, COBIT from the ISACA, and current change and patch management literature in order to demonstrate that there is a common stream of thought in the evolution of a framework for applying change management to information systems.

J	dos Santos, PFDA; Goncalves, CA; Afonso, T				de Andrade Augusto dos Santos, Pedro Ferraz; Goncalves, Carlos Alberto; Afonso, Tarcisio			A theoretical and methodological framework for analyzing structural and relational aspects of diffusion of innovations among organizations	REVISTA GESTAO & TECNOLOGIA-JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Diffusion of innovations; Innovation management; Organization for innovation; Supply chain		Innovation is seen as a key strategic priority for contemporary organizations, being frequently related to above-average returns. The competitive environment requires companies to structure even more complex and extensive networks for a superior performance. Therefore, besides increasing their innovation capacity, they must also be concerned in spreading the innovations across organizational networks in order to maximize their impact on the system performance as a whole. This paper proposes a theoretical and methodological framework for understanding the process of diffusion of innovations among members of a supply chain. We expect to contribute to future researches on the field by presenting a guiding model for the analysis of the process of diffusion of innovations among organizations, specifically with regard to the relationships between said phenomenon, the supply chain structure and particularities of its members.

The survey method was conducted through a questionnaire to 106 small and medium-sized manufacturing companies in the north of Santa Catarina. Descriptive statistics techniques were applied to verify the intensity of market orientation and brand orientation, resulting in a specific typology, ranking them according to their degree of intensity. Hierarchical regression model was applied to verify the study hypotheses. The study confirmed that the market orientation directly and positively affects the market performance, while brand orientation did not impact significantly and not moderated the relationship, which was measured by means of hierarchical regression. It is concluded that market orientation is key to better market performance in small and medium-sized enterprises and that only the brand orientation will not improve the performance of the studied firms.

The IT investments coherence is represented by two aspects: 1) Acknowledgement regarding to IT and its dimensions; 2) IT strategy alignment. Through the application of a survey instrument that analyzes the dimensions of the use of IT as well as a comparative analysis of decision flows, this approach is illustrated by using data from the perceptions of managers of a Brazilian company. Among the key findings of this research, it was noted that the proposed analysis approach provides ideas which consider relationships between dimensions of IT use and IT strategic alignment, helping researchers and practitioners to verify IT investments coherence in organizations.

First, we study the ecological properties and operational cycles of technical standards alliances based on the ecological system. Following the rule by which identification precedes assessment, we apply factor analysis to identify the key risk factors in the ecological system of such alliances. We then construct a fuzzy synthetic assessment model and conduct an empirical analysis on the energy saving and environmental protection industries in China. Taking the unique research perspective of the ecological system and using interdisciplinary research methods, this study establishes itself as a theoretical model to be used as a guideline in practice. The result is expected to provide a useful reference for furthering technological innovation in China's strategic emerging industries.

J	Swid, A				Swid, Amr			HOW CREATIVE CAN LEADERS AFFORD TO BE WITHOUT LOSING CREDIBILITY?	JOURNAL OF LEADERSHIP STUDIES			English	Article								Leaders know in their gut that creativity and innovation are the life blood of their organization. New ideas can lead to programs that are superior to an organization's established or planned programs. Leadership is to engage the right people, at the right times, to the right degree, in creative work. Inspirational leaders will promote employee creativity. On the other hand, the ability of leaders to be creative is an essential quality of leadership. Done well, the change of course looks like a moment of courage. The leader went to the precipice and had the strength to say, Let's turn back. Done badly, the change of course looks like pure opportunism or lack of conviction, and the leader's leadership credibility is undermined. The line between the two is thin. Which side a leader ends up on depends essentially on how the leader takes into account essential strategic factors, and how hard the leader will work to keep others on their side when they make the move.

The research is of character sectional, descriptive, quantitative and meso level. Empirical references are based on official information: National Census of Population, poverty map, IDH, IDS, sectoral indicators (education, health, housing, sanitation) and instruments of strategic and programmatic management. The results of the study are: in the Puno region, exclusion, as sociopolitical process, is expressed in the social inequality, inequality and poverty; whose concrete results are seen in the differential access to vital opportunities of employment, education and health. The conditions of access to employment, of the majority of the population in the Puno region, denote its character of inequity and inequality; Due to the limited opportunities that the population in the public and private sector, a situation that leads to the generation of self-employment or the condition of underloaded or unemployed especially of the vulnerable population or in a situation of poverty. The conditions of access to basic education in the Puno region, is marked by its exclusive nature, especially of the population in poverty and those located in rural areas; denoting not only its high sense of social inequity and inequality, but also, its precariousness in regard to the quality of education. The conditions of access to health services for the population in the Puno region, similarly, denotes his character of inequity and social exclusion for the vulnerable population and located in the rural area; this situation is exacerbated, due to the health services that are provided are not culturally appropriate.

Method of Assessing the Number of Technicians in Service of Manufacturing System	JOURNAL FOR MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND PRODUCTION			English	Article						number of technicians; reliability; downtime; manufacturing system		Productivity rate of manufacturing systems depends on technology, reliability of machinery, management, etc. The main attribute of machine's reliability, which is availability plays important role for determination of the number of technicians that support the workability of the multi-stations the manufacturing system. The random downtimes of the productive machines have probabilistic nature. Failures of machines can coincide that lead to increasing downtimes and decreasing output of machinery. Practically, a technician conducts repairs of failures for one machine, but at the same time other failed machines can be in downtime until the failed machine in servicing. This situation leads to increase idle time of machines and hence a manufacturing system. How many machines should be in service by one technician is typical problem for industries.

A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR IMPROBABLE CIRCUMSTANCES	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								Rare events, known as 'Black Swans', have determined the course of history. One of these was the global economic crisis of 2008. Such events highlight fields like strategic management and their shortcomings in helping to prepare organisations. The Strategic Framework for Improbable Circumstances was designed to add to the strategic management process by improving organisational preparation for these rare events. The framework was validated through interviews with experts who showed the need for such a framework, and who confirmed that it is a good first step for organisations to take towards addressing these Black Swan events.

J	Popescu, C				Popescu, Catalin			Compatibility of the Educational Systems and Capacity to Generate the Same set of Skills for the Future Employees	TEM JOURNAL-TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION MANAGEMENT INFORMATICS			English	Article						educational systems; labour market; qualifications; skills		The discussion on the educational systems in varied countries seems endless. There are different viewpoints from one country to another; yet, as the demand on the labour market has become global and, implicitly, the access to the jobs has been extended, the question naturally rises, to what extent are the educational systems convergent and can they generate an identical offer, based on similar skills of the candidates from different countries, aspects which should create equal employment opportunities. In the given context, it is of the utmost importance to create unitary educational systems, across wide geographical spaces, meant to answer such an evolution on economic-social and geo-strategic levels. Also, the educationprovidershave to customizetheiroffer in a proper way in orderto meetthe dynamical demands of employers.

Such innovations consist of various interrelated changes in information technology (IT), telecommunications, Internet service provider management, backup server product design, and so on. As data is regarded as a strategic corporate asset that must be protected, selecting a reliable innovative IT DR system has become high priority for many organizations. Such decision making problems usually face the challenges of seeking the most efficient DR system(s) to fulfill requirements of specific tasks or projects. Typical examples include the backup of big data, the recovery of operations in the case of emergencies being caused by natural or man-made disasters, cyber-attacks, etc. Therefore, how to evaluate and select an appropriate innovative IT DR system is critical for modern organizations. However, no existing studies have evaluated the performance of systemic innovation, in general, and IT DR systemic innovations especially. Thus, this paper aims to propose an analytic framework to evaluate the performance of IT DR systems. Given that IT DR system performance evaluation problems are indistinct and involve various considerations, this paper introduces data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods with derivations of the efficiency achievement measure (EAM). An empirical study on evaluating three DR systems belonging to a Taiwanese research institute will be used to demonstrate the feasibility of the analytic framework. This framework can serve as an appropriate method for evaluating the performance of DR system efficiency and then develop strategic plans for enhancing their performance.

Moreover, mixed predictions of the personality-tactic relationship have been derived from prior studies. One possible explanation is the influence of other intervening factors. In this regard, this study examines the role of withdrawal, as an intervening variable, in the negotiator personality-tactic relationship. State of withdrawal refers to the level of interest to continue with a negotiation. In a state of complete withdrawal, the interest to continue no longer exists and breakdown of the negotiation is inevitable. With the participation of practicing professionals, an experiment was used to collect data for the study. It was found that competitors are prone to withdraw and use more distributive tactics. However, this pattern changes with the composition of the dyad. If the negotiating counterpart is a cooperator, a competitor will adopt a more integrative approach. This finding reminds the importance of the personality factor in selecting members of a negotiating team.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Property company; Performance measurement; China; ROIC; EVA		This study investigates the economic value added (EVA) of 18 major Chinese property companies from 2006 to 2012. We categorize the companies in two ways: 1) companies concentrating on property vs multi-functional companies and 2) state-owned enterprises (SOEs) vs privately-owned enterprises (POEs). We find that on average, the mainland property companies experienced a negative EVA during the period 2006-2012. This is due to the companies undertaking long-term projects, and the companies do not recognize capital gain from property appreciation as income. Hence the EVA of the companies is, in fact, understated. The results also reveal that POEs outperform SOEs in terms of EVA. This reflects the inefficiency of SOEs. This research has two important implications to investors. Firstly, besides looking at the EVA of the companies, investors should also understand the nature of businesses of the companies thoroughly. Secondly, investors investing in emerging markets like China should have a thorough understanding of their market characteristics. This study can act as a reference for future studies in EVA of property companies in other emerging economies in the world.	[Hui, Eddie C.

J	Iman, AHM; Douglas, MU; Ali, HM				Iman, Abdul Hamid Mar; Douglas, Muhammad Umbugala; Ali, Hishamuddin Mohd			COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE SELF-ASSESSMENT (COPSA) AMONG FACILITIES OUTSOURCING FIRMS IN MALAYSIA: A FOCUS ON SERVICE DELIVERY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Facilities management; Service delivery; Outsourcing; Performance; Recursive model	MEASUREMENT SYSTEM-DESIGN; EMPLOYEE PERCEPTIONS; QUALITY; MANAGEMENT; SATISFACTION; CHAIN	Company performance self-assessment (CoPSA), whose fundamental purpose is to provide a check-and-balance mechanism for practice performance through progress-and-performance self-assessment (PaPSa) is yet to be in place in the facilities management industry. Specially needed by facilities service outsourcing firms (FSOFs), CoPSA benefits the top management from organizational introspection of company's own performance. This paper proposes and tests a CoPSA model using a parametric approach. Managers' perceptions about service delivery performance of their firm are measured using the likert scale and then deduced into a three-equation two-step recursive model. From a total of 207 randomly chosen Malaysian outsourcing firms, sixty responses were obtained. The results indicate that more than half of the sampled managers have envisioned high performance delivery, with 80% achievement as their goal. However, this has not been adequately supported by a coherent firm's internal structure. In view of the finding, the study concludes that the service delivery strategy of small fSofs in Malaysia is perceived to be rather passive.

METHODOLOGY FOR RECONCILING THE INTERESTS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BASED ON THE MATRIX OF PREFERENCE	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						subjects of medical practice; matrix of preferences; balance of interests		Currently, issues related to the formation of a technique of coordination of interests of participants of the system of health care are relevant because they determine priorities in the further development of the entire health care system. The article presents the methodological tools to harmonize the interests of medical activities; the basis of the construction is the matrix of preferences. The main objective of the matrix of preferences is the analysis of the possibility of achieving a balance of interests of all stakeholders of health care activities. Analysis of the regulatory framework and the scientific literature has shown the feasibility of a limited range of basic subjects of the relationship by the formula 4 + 3. Given the poly-subject provision of health care and medical services, the main subjects of analysis are determined as follows: public institutions; people (from the external environment of health care); medical organizations; health workers (from the internal environment of health care); health authorities; CHI Fund; medical insurance organizations (representatives of the health insurance system as a leading financial health care system of Russia). Using a binary analysis of the formation of methodological tools for the analysis of the matrix allowed revealing the essential characteristics of the analytical parameters of a subject's medical activities and correlating them with the characteristics of the analytical parameters of other subjects of medical activity. Presented methodological tools for constructing the matrix of preferences allows forming an array of analytical data for the management of the health system. Matrix allows us to consider the problem from different angles, to take into account the interests of the various actors of the health care system. In the future, it is possible to use the information in other assay systems, e.g., in a SWOT analysis. Using the matrix of preferences in the process of strategic planning of the national health care system will identify the essential characteristics of the analytical parameters of the subjects of health care activities as well as their ratio (contradiction, consistency). The practical component of the article is a sample from the homogeneous matrix of preferences and fan-analysis of the feasibility of preferences of the subjects of health care activities.

Social network analysis is used to analyze the vertical and horizontal relationships among the project, department and enterprise layers. Through a case study, the authors display the regulatory relationship of participants under given organization pattern and supply chain configuration. To disclose the restricted equilibrium mechanism of participants involved, changes under different strategies are compared, which can assist enterprises to enforce the decision making and to improve the R&D purchase system ability. The authors outline some of the managerial implications arising from the research findings at the end of this paper.

J	da Silva, AM; Maranhao, CMSD; Fernandes, TA				da Silva, Angelica Maria; Saraiva de Albuquerque Maranhao, Carolina Machado; Fernandes, Talita Almeida			Evaluation of training needs: a meta-synthesis	REVISTA CIENCIAS ADMINISTRATIVAS			Portuguese	Article						Analysis of training needs; Training; Skills		The design and implementation of a training program and development of human resources that allow the flexibility of organizations to the requirements of the internal and external environment are some of the main objectives of organizations seeking their survival and maintenance of its intellectual capital. To do this, you must know how to identify training needs in the company. Developing this diagnosis is not an easy task. This topic has been the subject of academic and market studies, seeking to structure a training needs analysis system (TNA). An analysis of these proposed models reveal a dissonance among scholars. In order to accomplish this, we performed a meta-synthesis according to the criteria established by Hoon (2013). The identification of the models was made through a bibliometric research in conference proceedings EnANPAD and EnGPR the years 2003-2014, as well as in issues of the same period of the journals of the A1-B2 spectrum, considered the greatest impact by Qualis Capes system. We believe that this research contributes to the understanding of management as a strategic area of people in organizations through the systematization of processes and optimization of its performance indicators.

J	Elshorbagy, S; Garg, L; Gupta, V; Narayanamurthy, G; Abd Al Oraini, Y				Elshorbagy, Sherif; Garg, Lalit; Gupta, Vipul; Narayanamurthy, Gopalakrishnan; Abd Al Oraini, Yosuf			The Impact of Information Systems on Management Performance in the Pharmaceutical Industry	JOURNAL OF CASES ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Information Systems; Operations Management; Performance Measurement; Pharmaceutical Industry	KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT	There are many aspects that should be considered while implementing ISs in pharmaceutical companies. This is due to the various regulations and standards that the governmental authorities impose on these companies. In addition, any audit from US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other authorities will require computer system validation to be performed for the implemented ISs to ensure that all areas that affect the drugs lifecycle are following the required standards, and that each single process in this lifecycle is validated. Unfortunately, many pharmaceutical companies didn't recognize yet the importance of ISs to their businesses. The research presented in this paper examines the value of using an information system (IS) in pharmaceutical environment and how it can be a key component of improving the operational and process effectiveness by supporting the strategic decisions and enabling the decision-makers to take their decisions in short time. Lack of information in pharmaceutical companies is one of the reasons why these companies will not be able to compete in this competitive market because the delays in taking decisions, product lifecycle, and supply chain. Pharmaceutical companies required to follow various regulations and standards, and ISs are the tools that can be mapped to these standards and control the business operations without any obstacles. The authors conducted a comprehensive study to investigate the role of ISs in the pharmaceutical industry through a review of existing literatures relevant to the research subject and through a questionnaire survey with 54 participants working in the pharmaceutical industry in different countries in the Middle East. The survey aimed to understand the present status of ISs in pharmaceutical companies and the impact of ISs on management performance, operation improvement, end-users productivity, and compliance with the regulations and standards of the pharmaceutical industry in their companies. Moreover, the survey also aimed to identify the catalysts behind successful implementation of ISs.

J	Fayers, K; Price, H				Fayers, Kate; Price, Hermione			Successful recommissioning of community diabetes services in West Hampshire	BRITISH JOURNAL OF DIABETES AND VASCULAR DISEASE			English	Article						commissioning; recommissioning; service redesign; community diabetes; clinical leadership		Introduction: The West Hampshire Community Diabetes Service replaced traditional hospital-based diabetes outpatients in 2010 and has been successfully recommissioned, one of the first community diabetes services to complete the commissioning cycle. Method: The successful introduction of traditional diabetes services into the community requires clear leadership and a strategic vision. Unlike many hospital-based services, the community setting is at the frontline of Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) targets for recommissioning. Thus, the threat of change is relentless and must be embraced rather than feared. As a result, the community setting can offer a new approach to the management of long-term conditions, with healthier and more productive partnerships between healthcare professionals and patients. We have identified four success criteria: skills for leadership, strategic vision, stakeholder partnerships, and shared learning. Results: The success of the diabetes service redesign in West Hampshire is reflected in successful recommissioning of the service by the West Hampshire CCG. This is one of the first such services to be successfully recommissioned in the country. Conclusions: Relocating general diabetes services into the community has been a catalyst for improved integration between specialist and primary care in West Hampshire. The process of service redesign and recommissioning is not widely communicated between consultant diabetologists, who will be pivotal to developing and delivering high-quality community care. Communicating these messages to doctors in training will ensure newly-appointed consultants have the skills required to lead change in local diabetes services and ensure high performing services are recommissioned successfully.

Following the recent economic crisis that has upset the balance of the western economy, but also the affirmation of the ethical models funds in the last three decades, the financial communication has taken on a strategic importance in the daily management of a business and, not only in those listed. In its evolution, financial communication, no longer addresses only to investors, but extends all users, by requiring greater transparency and providing the participatory involvement, especially the stakeholders. The content, alongside those purely economic, governed by national and international standards, make use of information and stories that reconstruct organizational and procedural, stories and values. This development is further enhanced by the use of new media, aiming at enhancing the image of the organization, to enhance the values and principles, objectives and plans for the future. In particular, the elements of corporate social responsibility, more than others, make explicit the value, credibility and the identity of corporate governance. The paper presents an analysis on the arrangements made by the leading European companies in international financial markets, focusing on the analysis of content, tools and communication strategies.

J	Moloi, T				Moloi, T.			Assessing corporate governance disclosures in South Africa's national government departments: The state and corporate governance	SOUTHERN AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDITING RESEARCH-SAJAAR			English	Article						Annual reports; corporate governance; disclosures; integrated reports; government; departments; King III; South Africa		The main objective of this study is to assess corporate governance disclosures in the annual reports of South Africa's national government departments. The main finding is that national government departments do not widely adhere to sound corporate governance practices, as recommended by the King III Report on Corporate Governance, and are required by the Public Finance Management Act, and the South African Treasury Regulations. The critical areas that were poorly disclosed by national government departments include the information which indicates whether the strategic internal audit plan was based on the key areas of risk facing the department, and whether this plan had taken into account the department's risk management strategy. Further, it was not clear whether departments had Chief Risk Officers, or a directorate for risk management, to drive the risk management programme. The study does note, however, that there are some national government departments that have demonstrated compliance with the spirit of good corporate governance by disclosing the required information in their annual reports. Stemming from this, the study recommends that those government departments which are compliant with the required corporate governance disclosures share their corporate governance disclosure practices with their counterparts in interdepartmental meetings. A further recommendation stemming from the findings is that those employees who are responsible for preparing the annual reports in each national government department should conduct a benchmarking exercise against other departments' annual reports, to assist them to identify and understand any shortcomings in their annual reports.

J	Haesebrouck, T				Haesebrouck, Tim			Explaining the Pattern of CSDP-Operations: Towards a Theoretical Synthesis	ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN AFFAIRS			English	Article						Common Security and Defence Policy; liberal theories; constructivism; rational-choice institutionalism; institutional design; realism; sovereignty	NORMATIVE POWER EUROPE; EU CRISIS MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIC CULTURE; COMMON SECURITY; NATION-STATE; UNION; REALISM; INTERVENTION; INTERESTS; LISBON	The EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) has mainly been used to deploy small-scale operations, which generally did not provide the member states with clear security benefits. This article combines insights from different theories of international relations to explain this disappointing track record. It argues that liberal theories adequately identify the domestic pressures the member states' governments need to accommodate in the area of crisis management. Constructivism, on its part, properly emphasises the diverging strategic cultures of the member states. Both theories however fail to explain why domestic pressures and diverging strategic cultures lead to small-scale operations. Rational-choice institutionalism does provide a convincing explanation for the latter by drawing attention to the CSDP's ineffective institutional design. Realism, in turn, is best positioned to explain why the CSDP was not designed more effectively, by emphasising the reluctance of states to transfer sovereignty to international organisations. The article concludes by discussing two measures that could alleviate the impact of the identified impediments on the CSDP's track record: devising a CSDP-strategy and adapting the consensus rule. However, since the latter is very unlikely in the near future, the CSDP is not expected to develop into a more effective framework for crisis management.

Methodology to Develop A Recovery Strategy for the Sturgeon Stocks of The Caspian Sea	TURKISH JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Caspian sturgeons; recovery strategy; methodology	FISHERIES	The situation of sturgeons (Acipenseriformes) in the Caspian Sea which many experts currently assess as "Catastrophic", is discussed. In today's complex environment of the region, traditional approaches to recovery of sturgeon stocks, based on the classical biological paradigm of stocks management already untenable. A new approach based on the extended paradigm consisting along with classical representations, ideas and methods of "Strategic planning" is proposed. Developed within the framework of this approach the methodology opens up wide possibilities to choose adequate recovery strategy in the conditions of many challenges today facing Caspian sturgeon management: Large-scale poaching, pollution of spawning rivers and sea, destruction of a unified management system (after the collapse of the USSR), transgression of the sea, invasions, etc.			Karayev, RA (corresponding author), 9 B Vahabzade Str, AZ-1141 Baku, Azerbaijan.	karayevr@rambler.ru	Karayev, Robert/AAE-3692-2019				Andrews K., 1987, CONCEPT CORPORATE ST; [Anonymous], 2006, NATL STURGEON MANAGE; [Anonymous], 2004, EXP PAN MAN PROC GUI; Ansoff H.

J	McGrath, RG				McGrath, Rita Gunther			The Academic Entrepreneur: A Biographical Sketch of Ian C. MacMillan's Contributions to Establishing the Field of Entrepreneurship	STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP JOURNAL			English	Article						entrepreneurship; Ian C; MacMillan; institutionalization; Journal of Business Venturing; Snider Entrepreneurial Center; entrepreneurial networks	PIMS-BASED ANALYSIS; PRODUCT PORTFOLIO; INNOVATION; ADVANTAGE; PROMISE	Ian C. MacMillan, originally from Africa, is a seminal figure in forging the contours of the present-day field of entrepreneurship. He was the first to empirically explore topics such as venture capital decision making; entrepreneurial networks; cultural influences on entrepreneurial behavior; and many issues in corporate venturing. Through the creation of vibrant, global, scholarly networks, the founding of the Journal of Business Venturing, his dedication to training and mentoring the next generation of scholars, and establishing the first large-scale systematic global data collection in the field, Mac has made an irreplaceable contribution to the well-established field that entrepreneurship has become. He and his students have been acknowledged as having made significant breakthroughs in our understanding of entrepreneurial phenomena, recognized by a burgeoning number of awards and testaments to scholarly recognition. He argues that the challenge for future researchers will be to tackle big, messy problems that do not lend themselves to the popular methodologies employed by academia today.

J	Milano, GV; Cryan, JR				Milano, Gregory V.; Cryan, John R.			Be Your Own Activist	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CORPORATE FINANCE			English	Article								The proliferation of activist oriented hedge funds has put CEOs and boards on high alert. In response, many are engaging in legal and public and investor relations exercises to protect themselves against impending "attacks." The typical pre-emptive "defense" uses tools, such as poison pills and staggered boards, that are relics from the 1980s era of hostile takeovers and LBOs. But unlike the corporate raiders of the past, today's activist investors typically do not seek to " take control" of a company. What most activists are seeking is to explore, both with management and the other shareholders, the possibility of increasing efficiency and value by altering the company's strategic path or making important changes in its operating or financial policies. The authors of this article urge corporate leaders to take a different approach in preparing for a possible activist engagement-one they describe as becoming "Your Own Activist." Drawing on decades of experience as corporate advisors-and referring to dozens of activist engagements over the last several years, the authors describe a proactive way for companies to prepare for the possibility of a confrontation with an activist-one that begins with a thorough understanding of the firm's vulnerabilities and a commitment to adopt all of the strategies likely to create value-without waiting to be told to do so. At the same time, management should be prepared to respond to activist demands that, although perhaps warranted in other cases, are not well suited to the company's circumstances.

J	Ming, L				Ming, Liu			Northeast Asia Order after WWII: Continuity, Compliance, Power-Transition and Challenges	KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS			English	Article						World War II; post-War world order; American Re-balancing Strategy; San Francisco System; Sino-American competition; re-shaping the regional order		East Asia is now fully engaged in a competition between a rising China and the other powers-the United States and Japan-while the regional order is in a transition from a super primacy of the United States to the asymmetric bipolar structure of the United States and China. China is changing a lot in terms of capabilities and behavior; but China also shows its benevolence, such as benefit-sharing initiatives on regional institutionalization development. The "American rebalancing strategy" has partly reversed the overall situation in East Asia in favor of the United States, but as 57 countries have joined the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Beijing has now recovered some ground from this overwhelming tide of the U.S. strategy. China's military modernization and Sino-Japanese confrontation over the Diaoyu Islands offer a big excuse and incentive for Japan's acceleration of this process of becoming a normal country. The future of Northeast Asia lies mainly in the four variables and their interactions: the Chinese Communist Party's capability to balance its goal of national rejuvenation and nationalistic emotion in protecting its sovereignty interests; the United States' genuine attitude toward China's power development; Japan's goal of its nationalistic resurgence and its complicated strategic ties with China and South Korea; and North Korean regime stability and nuclear capability development. In spite of the Sino-American competition relations, there always exists a demand of condominium and strategic interdependence on global governance and other hot issues in the international arena. Therefore, management of China-U.S. competition is key to stability of the regional order.

J	Park, D; Marchand, T				Park, Damien; Marchand, Troy			The Activist Investor Process Model: Phase One of a Successful Campaign-Identifying a Target	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CORPORATE FINANCE			English	Article								This article by an advisor of hedge fund activism and a deep value investor explores the process by which seasoned shareholder activists identify and evaluate a target company. Activist investment campaigns often involve a comprehensive and sophisticated analysis of corporate valuations, governance structures, shareholder sentiment, and institutional voting policies. Almost all of this analysis is completed behind-the-scenes and well before holding discussions with management or publicizing specific demands for strategic, operational, and financial changes. The first phase of an activist campaign typically begins with the screening of thousands of companies based on economic and financial parameters to help narrow the list of potential targets. In determining the hidden value and potential return of each target company, activists are attracted by a number of corporate characteristics, including low capitalization, high trading liquidity, net cash and unused debt capacity, asset diversification, and a sum-of-the-parts valuation that, generally as a consequence of such diversification, is significantly greater than the whole. Other criteria activists consider include the company's legal structure and corporate governance provisions, and the composition of the shareholder base. While not all campaigns are the same, the authors have found that the most sophisticated activists follow a predictable pattern of analysis-one that starts with the identification of a solid activist target that meets many pre-determined parameters, is followed by an engagement with management, and, in cases where a constructive dialogue does not develop, public discourse with other shareholders and possibly a proxy contest.

Most of goods made by materials based on wastes have to be commonly used by people. Antibacterial character of those is necessary to avoid epidemics. This paper deals with determination of antimicrobial character of materials based on polymeric wastes in comparison with virgin polyolefins. Surface contamination, total number of germs, E. coli and Enterococci growth on the samples surface have been determined and correlated with the surface characteristics of materials (hydrophobicity, surface energy, polarity, charge, roughness) as well as with bulk characteristics such as Young Modulus, crystallinity, water sorption. The conclusion of this study is that materials based on wastes are more sanitary safe by comparing to virgin polymers obtained without antimicrobial additives. This is due to possible maintaining in wastes of active antibacterial additives used in the plastic goods processing. High crystallinity and low water sorption avoid their release. Surface conformation seems to not fit to bacteria shape and dimensions, hindering their adhesion and growth. Negatively charged surface repels negative bacteria. Lower surface hydrophily of wastes, coming from OH and CO groups' elimination, due to photo-degradation during their life cycle, determines lower adhesion of more hydrophilic bacteria such as E. coli.

J	Shrayber, NY				Shrayber, Natalia Yu.			THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF COST MANAGEMENT IN COOPERATIVE ORGANIZATIONS	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						cost of organization; consumer cooperation; socio-economic potential; theory and methodology of management		Current economic conditions in Russia as well as in other countries are characterized by increased competition on the one hand and scarcity of resources on the other. Consequently, company management is in constant search for new management tools that can respond adequately to changes in the external and internal environment. Changes in business practices stipulate the development of new approaches to company management that guarantee efficiency and competitiveness of companies. Thus, the concept of company value management appeared in management theory and practice. Implementation of this concept predetermined the formation of management techniques integrated in the value approach. The main idea of value approach is that the strategic aim and criteria of company success are determined by the company's value (its capitalization) that reflects the perspectives of owners' growth in prosperity. Thus, primarily, company owners are interested in the development of value management methods. Still, the techniques of owners' influence on managerial efficiency and, eventually, on the company's value are formed by combination of the following factors: legal form of organization, form of ownership, type of economic activity, degree of legislation regulation, level of social responsiveness, priority for national and regional economies. Due to the fact that these factors in all their complexity, in the author's opinion, should be considered in the implementation of the value approach, a theoretical and methodological basis of value management relating to the activities of consumer cooperatives was formed. The main idea and purpose of the research, the results of which are presented in this article, is to develop a theoretical and methodological framework of cooperative organizations' value management that provides enhancement of company performance and harmony of social and entrepreneurial efficiency of cooperative organizations. In the course of research the author used general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, comparison, method of system approach and modeling techniques. As a result of the research, the author defined socio-economic potential, substantiated logic and methodology of cooperative organizations value management. The author's definition of socioeconomic potential differs from the traditional one by inclusion of social resources in it and by focusing on satisfying the needs of shareholders, staff and society. Logic of cost management in consumer cooperation, as opposed to traditional approaches, is based on interrelation of assets and in-house financing sources of corporate operations and implies a new criterion of corporate value increment.

J	Warsow, KM				Warsow, Karyn M.			Transportation public health link: Changing perspectives ... Changing a culture through cross-disciplinary collaboration	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH			English	Article						Transport; Health; Cross-disciplinary; Collaboration; Evidence-based; Systems		The Transportation Public Health Link (TPH Link) is based on a conceptual framework of the transportation planning process that considers the synergy between the social, political, environmental, and economic elements that influence the health of communities. As a multi-dimensional integrative problem solving approach, this process has the flexibility to account for individual determinants of health acting at different levels. In this manner, an upstream perspective is used to understand the diverse impacts on quality of life. The TPH Link supports the inclusion of a cross-disciplinary team of professionals in the design, planning and development of proposed and rehabilitated transportation infrastructure projects. Quantitative and qualitative research, performance metrics, and strategic management methodologies from multiple disciplines areused to effectively evaluate the impact of a proposed facility. This systematic approach including continuous process improvement, project evaluation, data analyses, and outreach and education drive the process. As funding streams continue to shrink and the demand for accountability and improvements in operational efficiencies increase, it is imperative for transportation to partner with nontraditional disciplines to devise strategic goals, transparency, and innovative ideas that meet the health and transportation needs of a growing population.

Therefore, this study focused on identifying factors that contribute to the sustainability of growth for small firms in a developing country. Small firms are vital in the development and growth of bottom billion economies and are part of solutions to social problems that Namibia experience, inter alia, high unemployment rate. In developing countries, it is estimated that 45% of formal sector workers belong to SMEs and about 24% of GDP is contributed by small firms. SMEs are known for the common characteristics such as responsiveness, strategic agility, and leanness in operations management that are often aimed to meet and exceed variations of market demands. Thus far, it is crucial to study such behavior of small firms responsible for their growth or demise in the contemporary markets where small firms are crippled by raspy competition from MNCs.

J	Aziz, PRB				Aziz, Puan Rafidah Binti			Influence of training in today marketing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article						Training; Salesperson; Organization; Outcomes	MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE	Quality of human resource is an asset to organization. Consequently, quality training can promote both personal and organizational success. This study suggests that training on salesperson's knowledge and skills can develop the positive beliefs and attitudes which lead to enhance organizational outcomes. Most organizations meet their needs for training in a haphazard way rather than design training in a rational way. The aim of the study is intended to investigate the impact of training on salespeople's knowledge and skills for organizational benefits. Data were gathered by surveying 238 salespeople in the Malaysian major retail shopping malls. Data were analyzed using the partial least square technique. Training has significant impact on salesperson's experience (salesperson's knowledge and salesperson's skills), while salesperson's experience has positive impact on the three categories of organizational outcomes (i.e., productivity, effectiveness and performance). These findings have important implication for designing strategic plans for the Malaysian retail industry. (c) 2015 IASE Publisher All rights reserved.

STRATEGIC DECISIONS OF HIGH-GROWING IT-COMPANIES: A CASE-STUDY OF THE COMPANY "SKB KONTUR"	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						high-growing companies; "gazelles"; business model; strategic solutions; IT-sector		This paper is written in the form of a case study research. The object of research is strategic tools of the company "SKB Kontur" as a "gazelle" (or high-growing company), which works in the IT-sector. The paper includes information about indicators used to define the class of "gazelles". High-growing companies are the points of economic growth and qualitative change agents. Their efficiency and effectiveness are shown in all spheres of activity. Companies of this type are distinguished by the exponential growth of the revenue. However, this does not guarantee them the attention and support from the government at the regional level. In the crisis of the Russian economy, high-growing companies base on their previous experience and use a variety of strategic tools, depending on the market features that allow them not only to compete, but also to maintain the growth rate in the long run. The work mainly focuses on the identification of a strategic management tool allowing to maintain a high growth rate in the specific IT-sector of the Russian economy. To achieve the goal, the authors used qualitative (expert interviews, content analysis) and quantitative (measurement of financial performance of the company) methods. This allowed identifying the characteristics of the IT-sector, strategic solutions used by "SKB Kontur" to compete with foreign and Russian companies on rising and falling markets. The IT-sector in the Russian economy has a number of features: the possibility of industry leadership does not depend on the location of the company headquarters, suppliers, consumers, and the size of the start-up capital. The most important condition for success is the availability of quality human resources and access to administrative resources. Implementation of outsourcing projects in other sectors of the economy is also an important trend for the growth of the company. The challenge for the development can be considered as the entry of new players into the market and redistribution of existing markets. Major industry barriers to competition are the specifics of the Russian legislation, the monopolization of access to the client and close contacts with the authorities of state regulation.

Four established change models have been applied to the bank to find out how a change comes in/is brought in, managed, and how it affects organizational environment and its stakeholders, particularly customers and employees. The four established change models applied are the change management approach by Ansoff and McDonnell; the change management model by Kurt Lewin; the 7S framework by Thoman J. Peters and Robert H. Waterman; and the change management model developed by Stephanie Elam. The study covers a change management aspect such as strategic intervention technique; a need for change management; resource implication; planning change; strategies in change management; system effectiveness; managing resistance to change; leadership issues; cultural issues; people issues; external environment issues; workable approach to overcome change resistance; appropriate model and implementing the model.				haleemfazal@gmail.com					Ansoff I., 1990, IMPLEMENTING STRATEG; Bob Hamlin, 2001, ORG CHANGE DEV REFLE; Elam S, HELPING EMPLOYEES AD; Florence Heffron, 1968, ORG THEORY PUBLIC OR; Gai HongWei, 2003, INFORM ORG CULTURE C; IBM, IBMS VIEW KEY CONS S; Keller S, WHY IT ISNT WORKING; Krawford K, CASE STUDY ANAL ORG; Oakland JS, 2007, TOTAL QUAL MANAG BUS, V18, P1, DOI 10.1080/14783360601042890; SCHEIN EH, 1990, AM PSYCHOL, V45, P109, DOI 10.1037/0003-066X.45.2.109; Song X, 2009, J CAMBRIDGE STUDIES, V4; Tushman M, 1997, MANAGING STRATEGIC I; Wood J., 2010, ORG BEHAV CORE CONCE	13	0	0	2	2	DE GRUYTER POLAND SP ZOO	WARSAW	BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR., 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND	1800-9581	2336-9205		J CENT BANK THEOR PR	J.

J	Naicker, V; Omer, N				Naicker, Visvanathan; Omer, Nasraldine			MEASUREMENT AND DETERMINING FACTORS AFFECTING THE LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES			English	Article						Knowledge management; institutional theory; organisational learning; technology adoption; knowledge management strategy		This paper provides a new model for assessing the performance of firms in their Knowledge Management (KM) endeavours. This research investigates and identifies the main determinants of successful KM processes. Firms have been accumulating and applying knowledge to create competitive advantages. The emphasis on knowledge management in contemporary firms is based on the notion that problems to the transfer and replication of knowledge bestow KM with strategic prominence. As a result, firms are at various stages of planning and implementing knowledge-based strategies to improve their competitiveness in the marketplace. Moreover, there are human factors that facilitate or hinder the ability of firms and their staff to adopt and implement competitive, business technologies. Hence, the use of institutional theory to develop an integrative model in measuring the constructs of successful KM process capabilities is considered in this paper. The research model is tested with a survey study involving 682 firms in which data was collected over 6 months. The empirical results provided strong support for the model. In addition to its theoretical contributions, this study presents important practical suggestions through the identification of specific proficiencies leading to KM success.

ZONING OF THE OB-TOM INTERFLUVE TERRITORY BY THE ECOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL PRINCIPLE	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						anthropogenic impact; ecological and functional zoning; Ob-Tom interfluve		In this article the authors offered a scheme of ecological and functional zoning on the example of the territory between rivers Ob and Tom like a division of the territory into zones with establishment of their functional purpose and mode of use, with definition of types and extents of anthropogenic impact. Thereby, ecological and functional zoning represents a set of methodological tools which are applied to creation of the spatial organization of activity of society in the concrete territory providing steady environmental management for preservation of the main functions. The territory of Ob-Tom interfluve is a developed territory, with a complex economic structure which allows to fulfill different models of optimization of environmental management now. This creates prerequisites for improvement of the territorial structure, development of the system of environmental management considering not only economic, but also ecological values. During the research of the territory, we used various cartographic, statistical and archival materials. The methodology of zoning consists of two stages: the first is allocation of functional (economic) zones; the second is the ecological component of zoning. At the stage of primary functional zoning we ranged the received results on the basis of land type classification and unified them by the prevailing factor of economic use of the territory. At the estimation stage we added the generalizing expert assessment, such as the anthropogenic transformation of the territory, its multifunctionality and functional conflict. The territory of our research is a complex, multifunctional, ecological, social and economic object; a reserve for expansion of the territory of the city; a strategic object because of using the groundwater intake; a zone of agricultural and forestry production; a territory of intensive recreational use. As a result of the complex analysis, we made a detailed description of natural and economic conditions of each concrete site, including important factors of development, the list of real and potential problems, the key conflicts of resource consumption, the list of the sites most sensitive to anthropogenic impact. Thus, carrying out complex ecological and functional zoning of the territory is a necessary condition for the organization of the territory for the purpose of habitat preservation. In general, it should be noted that the designed scheme has an expert character, yet it is of big importance when developing the now available organizational and legal actions in the territory arrangement for more effective and ecologically safe system of environmental management and creation of the monitoring system of environment condition.

J	Rozhkov, KL				Rozhkov, Kirill Lvovich			A Marketing Approach to the Study of Megacity: Necessity, Principles and Prospects	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SOCIOLOGY-EKONOMICHESKAYA SOTSIOLOGIYA			Russian	Article						place marketing; megacity marketing; urban concepts; city users; urban product concept; city benefits	RESIDENTIAL-LOCATION PREFERENCES; INTERREGIONAL MIGRATION; CREATIVE CLASS; CITY	This paper focuses on the feasibility of urban development concepts in the frame of different and contradictory needs of city residents. The aim of this paper is to justify the need for a marketing approach to big city investigations, to define its key principles, and show its main prospects. The author's reasoning is based on the comparison of purposeful and spontaneous logics of city development. Through the analysis of various urban conflicts, the author shows that a spontaneous logic can prevent urban development concepts, projects, and separate decisions influencing residential life from being implemented when the diversity of residential needs is ignored. On the contrary, a marketing approach to urban studies could combine purposeful and spontaneous logic and, thereby, support city management. However, far too little attention has been paid in the previous resident-oriented marketing studies to the behavioural differences of user groups and the interrelated issue of simultaneous place use. There is also a critical gap in the topic of the selection process of target groups of the megacity and marketing to various groups with contradictory interests. Elements influencing strategic statement for a megacity are considered and, on this basis, the following basic principles of megacity marketing analysis are formulated: (1) to make a comparison between the city benefits sought by its residents and visitors, on one hand, and those which the city or urban concept offers, on the other; (2) to identify user groups with alternative requirements to the city and alternative urban product concepts; (3) to pay more attention to the way in which urban residents "use" the city when segmenting residents for marketing analysis. Techniques of megacity marketing analysis are demonstrated using the results of an empirical study of several Moscow districts. Results obtained from this research also have pragmatic value in that they can be used as an assessment tool for the feasibility of future urban development concepts.

J	Shimaoka, M				Shimaoka, Motomu			Strategic career planning for physician-scientists	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SCIENCE			English	Article							HAPPINESS; LEADERSHIP; SUCCESS	Building a successful professional career in the physician-scientist realm is rewarding but challenging, especially in the dynamic and competitive environment of today's modern society. This educational review aims to provide readers with five important career development lessons drawn from the business and social science literatures. Lessons 1-3 describe career strategy, with a focus on promoting one's strengths while minimizing fixing one's weaknesses (Lesson 1); effective time management in the pursuit of long-term goals (Lesson 2); and the intellectual flexibility to abandon/modify previously made decisions while embracing emerging opportunities (Lesson 3). Lesson 4 explains how to maximize the alternative benefits of English-language fluency (i.e., functions such as signaling and cognition-enhancing capabilities). Finally, Lesson 5 discusses how to enjoy happiness and stay motivated in a harsh, zero-sum game society.

J	Traverse, T				Traverse, Tatyana			PSYCHOLOGICAL DETERMINANTS OF ERRORS IN SOLVING POLITICAL TASKS	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						tasks solving; actors; political thinking		This article is devoted to the problem of rational orientation of actors in the political reality and the influence of political thinking on this process. The main objective of the study is the analysis of political errors made by the actors during the solution of political problems, and identification of the main factors that cause them. The following actors participated in the study: a group of deputies of different district and local councils of Ukraine, as well as students involved to a different extent into political activities, namely: a) students-political scientists; b) students having non-political and non-humanitarian profile (specialty: mechanical engineering, mathematics); c) Students specialized in psychology, religion, philosophy; g) students participating in political events on the Maidan during autumn 2013-winter 2014. The participants had to solve four types of political information problems aimed at the analysis, forecasting, decision making, management. The study founded that the errors of political thinking were determined by the following factors: 1) the extent, quality of the functioning and the ratio of political thinking components (cognitive, operational, regulative and personal); 2) properties of political thinking (objectivity, notion-based thinking, practicality, creativity); 3) mental actions that provided staging and integrity of the search process (preparation, planning, evaluation, implementing, testing); 4) using mechanisms of solving the political problems, in particular strategic organization, particularly, the strategies of combination, analogy, reconstruction, universal or mixed, and the random act strategy; 5) the type of political problem. The study of this topic is highly relevant as political actors have great impact on the formation of the state and public policy in different areas. This study is especially relevant keeping in mind active political transformations in the Ukrainian politics, which directly influence the formation of the country's development strategies. The study results showed numerous errors made by the participants during the solution of problems. Thus we can conclude that preparation of strong and active political actors requires more thorough training, quality control of tasks which, in turn, will significantly reduce and prevent errors in the interpretation political reality by the actor.

SIMPLE STRATEGIC ANALYSIS TOOLS AT SMES IN ECUADOR	INDEPENDENT JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & PRODUCTION			English	Article						Strategic analysis tools; SME; Formulation; Competitiveness; context assessment; value		This article explores the possible applications of Strategic Analysis Tools (SAT) in SMEs1 located in emerging countries such as Ecuador (where there are no formal studies on the subject). It is intended to analyze if whether or not it is feasible to effectively apply a set of proposed tools to guide mental map decisions of executives when decisions on strategy have to be made. Through an in-depth review of the state of the art in regards to SAT and interviews performed to main participants such as chambers and executives of different firms, it is shown the feasibility of their application. This analysis is complemented with specialists' interviews to deepen our insights and obtaining valid conclusions. Our conclusion is that SMEs can smoothly develop and apply an appropriate set of SAT when opting for very relevant choices. However, there are some inconveniences to be solved which are connected with resources (such as peoples' abilities and technology) and behavioral (cultural factors and methodological processes). Once these barriers are knocked down, it would be more likely to enrich current approaches to make strategic decisions even more effective. This is a qualitative investigation and and the research design is not experimental (among them it is transversal as it relates to a specific moment in time).

This research is unique in its scope by considering all management functions while trying to integrate the stakeholders into the strategic decisions of the management. The model is tested on a sample with 303 respondents from software companies (175), hardware companies (100) and a sectoral association (28) in Turkey to explore how stakeholder relationships are managed based on the perceptions of the managers and the employees. Whereas the pilot study showed us the feasibility of the model, the main study results indicated how the stakeholder relationships are managed in a group of sample IT organizations when compared to the ideal criteria given by the proposed model. The model may prove to be a managerial guide for the managers at all levels for their attempts to integrate stakeholder interests into the management processes.	[Demirel, A. Gonul; Oner, M.

J	McCreight, R				McCreight, Robert			Constitutional Authority in Crisis: Examining a State Governor's Emergency Powers	JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Article X; emergency powers; homeland security; state governor		The powers of our nation's 50 state governors are enshrined in our Constitution in Article X, wherein those governors may exercise broad authority for their populations, especially in conditions of extreme emergency. However, the full extent of a governor's emergency powers are not well understood, nor have they been explored in depth to assess the governor's discretionary authority in a national emergency. Despite the catastrophic events of 9/11 and subsequent 21st century threats, the scope of augmented emergency powers granted to governors remains ambiguous. Specifically, governors lack the robust authority to offer sustained emergency response and recovery operations beyond the normal 72 hours most cities and communities routinely prepare for and expect. However, if Washington, DC, is preoccupied, disabled, or distracted by its own post-attack strategic vulnerability and beset by continuity of operations planning requirements and national security imperatives, the federal government may not be able to set in to provide help after those first 72 hours. Therefore, our governors must plan for sustained operations for an additional 2 weeks after a national catastrophe and equip themselves for that scenario, which puts an enormous strategic burden on them.

The efficacy and adverse effects of beta(2-)agonists are heterogeneous in individual patients, which may be partly caused by genetic variations in metabolizing enzymes and receptor molecules. The present study was designed to analyze the relationship between gene polymorphisms and physiological effects of procaterol in healthy subjects. Methods: Ninety-two non-smoking healthy volunteers were given 1 mg/kg body weight (max 50 mu g) of procaterol as a dry syrup preparation, and the serum concentrations of procaterol, serum K+, and the physical responses were monitored for 240 min. We genotyped beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) (Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu), cytochrome P450 3A4 (rs2246709, rs4646437), and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) (rs4148323 [allele A, *6], rs12479045, rs4148328, rs4663971, rs12052787, rs4148329, A (TA)(6/7) TAA [seven-repeat allele, *28]). Procaterol concentrations in serum were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results: No gene polymorphisms affected serum procaterol concentrations. Meanwhile, overall serum K+ level changes were significantly lower in carriers of UGT1A1*28 than in non-carriers after correcting for strong effects of serum procaterol concentrations and baseline K+ levels. No other polymorphisms were associated with serum K+ levels. None of polymorphisms of ADRB2 were associated with any physical responses. Conclusion: The present study indicates that significant hypokalemia may occur in carriers of UGT1A1*28 by systemic administration of procaterol and potentially by other beta(2)-agonists metabolized in the liver.

CRITICAL REFLECTIONS ON 20 YEARS OF GROUNDWATER RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION IN SOUTH AFRICA	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY			English	Article								The aim of this paper is to highlight the changes that have taken place in terms of groundwater resource development and management in South Africa in the 20 years since the political transformation of the country in 1994. Groundwater, the previously neglected resource, received a strategic role in the monumental programme to bring basic water infrastructure coverage to more than 95% of the population during this period. The post-1994 water policy. reforms have also had a very positive impact on groundwater; its legal status changed from "private water" to a "significant resource" and it became an integral part of integrated water resource management in terms of the National Water Act, 1998. A systematic assessment of changes, undertaken within a framework of groundwater governance, indicates that significant advances have been made in the groundwater field at the enabling environment/policy level as well as at the strategic/national level in terms of institutional and management instrument development. Thus groundwater has become an integral part of water resource planning, with appropriate groundwater data and information systems to back this up. Groundwater management at the national level can still be significantly improved by way of appropriate regulations that address the unique requirements of groundwater resources in terms of protection, information management and human resources. The present challenge lies at the local level, where the management of thousands of groundwater schemes was transferred from national government and from community management structures to newly established municipal administrations. Urgent attention will need to be given to building the institutional capacity for groundwater resource management at this local level. It will require the coordinated effort of the entire groundwater sector, led by the national Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) and founded in ongoing research and development through the Water Research Commission (WRC).

The grant funded the Collaborative Research Grant Initiative: Mental Wellness in Seniors and Persons with Disabilities (CRGI), designed to collaboratively generate knowledge to improve the effectiveness of programs, services, and supports for the mental health needs of seniors and adults with disabilities. CRGI researchers received support via workshops that provided grant process information and basic research instruction, as well as an annual conference to share research results and network with each other. We used social network analysis to assess whether CRGI objectives regarding collaboration were achieved and to provide examples of possible future strategic planning. A survey of grant recipients with questions addressing collaboration before and after CRGI events was also completed. Awareness among grant recipients increased drastically from before and after the CRGI. Information workshops and the conference both provided successful support and increased awareness of ongoing work among grant recipients.	[Barron, Gary R.

Decisions made at the strategic level of management,mostly the decision whether it is more profitable to make or buy a product, are strongly influenced by the the status of expenses and efficiency of business functions. The term outsourcing has attracted a lot of attention of business circles for years when making the decision whether it is better to provide and sell secondary service in your own company or hire the other company to do it. Outsourcing has a lot of advanatages and for that reason it is considered to be one of the most important business trends nowadays.

J	Czarnecka-Gallas, M				Czarnecka-Gallas, Marta			The Institutional and External Factors Behind the Switch of a Country's Economic Growth Strategy. The Case of the Brazilian Economic Policy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Brazil; economic growth strategy; economic policy; industrial policy; strategic trade policy; international trade; industrialization; economic development		One of the most important tasks for Brazil after the Second World War was to change the structure of its economy. Due to a relatively low level of domestic industry, consecutive governments found industrialization the main priority and focused on industrial policy to foster that process. One can argue that industrial policy was the core element of Brazilian economic policy throughout the post-war period, until the liberalization reforms of the 1980 s. Political and economic traditions, together with rapid changes in global economy over the last decades, have had a huge impact on more recent Brazilian economic policy. On one hand, the country has kept looking back to the protectionist practices that have shaped its economy since the emergence of the modern Brazilian state, on the other, Brazil's ambition is to become a leading emerging economy and serious partner in the developed world. A dual development track, and continuous inner-conflict between protectionism and liberalism, is clearly visible in Brazilian economic policy and often leads to contradictory measures being taken by successive governments. The objectives of the article is to provide a contextualized analysis of the evolution of Brazil's economic growth strategy, with a particular focus on the role of economic and political traditions, and institutions.

J	Erwin, CO; Landry, AY				Erwin, Cathleen Owens; Landry, Amy Yarbrough			Organizational Characteristics Associated With Fundraising Performance of Nonprofit Hospitals	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Fundraising has become increasingly important to nonprofit hospitals as access to capital has grown more difficult and reimbursement for services more complex. This study analyzes the variation in organizational characteristics and fundraising performance among nonprofit acute care hospitals in the United States to identify and measure critical factors related to one key fundraising performance indicator: public support. Results indicate that the presence of an endowment, along with its value, investments in fundraising, and the geographic location of the organization, account for approximately 46% of variance in public support among nonprofit hospitals. The use of a separate foundation for the fundraising operation is not necessarily associated with measures of fundraising success; however, a majority of hospitals do use a foundation, signaling a strategic choice that may be made for numerous reasons. The study results and limitations are discussed and recommendations are made for maximizing the effectiveness of the fundraising enterprise within nonprofit hospitals. Increasing awareness of challenges associated with fundraising success will enhance the strategic management of fundraising operations by hospital executives and board members.

Although EBN has been promoted in Taiwan for more than 10 years, variations in the organizational policies and strategies necessary to support EBN among healthcare organizations have prevented effective implementation. Barriers to the implementation of EBN located at the organizational level have also been reported. The need for a model that focuses on the organizational infrastructure to promote EBN in Taiwan has therefore become increasingly apparent. Purpose: This study aims to develop a model that contains the key contextual elements of organizational infrastructure necessary to effectively promote EBN, especially in hospital settings. Methods: A steering committee drafted the components and related strategies of the proposed model. Delphi technique was used to obtain consensus on the proposed model among a group of experts with expertise in EBN. Thirty experts participated in all three rounds of the Delphi survey. To confirm the appropriateness of the proposed model for clinical settings, the model was further reviewed by a focus group composed of experts with experience in implementing EBN or evidence-based medicine in hospitals. The strategies were then further modified based on the suggestions of this focus group, and only those strategies that best fit hospital settings were retained. Results: Five key contextual elements and related strategic processes were identified, including equipment, policy, training courses, outcome indicators, and reward plans. The resultant model was named EPCOR, an acronym composed of the names of each identified element. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: EPCOR is a comprehensive model of organizational infrastructure and strategic procedures for implementing EBN in hospital-based settings in Taiwan. Organizations may use the EPCOR model to initiate and implement EBN practices and then to evaluate their effectiveness.

The neutral mononuclear complexes with a generic [M(tzp) n] structure have been prepared from Htzp and corresponding transition metals chlorides at 2: 1 and 3: 1, respectively molar ratios in H2O-EtOH. The resulted crystalline complexes were investigated through magnetic and molar conductivity measurements, elemental analysis, FT-IR, mass spectroscopy, thermal analysis, UV-Vis and P-XRD. The experiments indicate that Htzp acts as bidentate anionic ligand, [Co(tzp)2]center dot 1.5H(2)O and [Cd(tzp)2] are in the tetragonal coordination, whereas six coordinate octahedral [Rh(tzp) 3]center dot H2O complex undergoes a weak tetragonal distortion. In case of Co(II) complex, an interesting feature was revealed through fluorescence spectroscopy, as the fluorescent emission intensity of the free ligand is dependent on the Co(II) solution content. Through complexation, the fluorescence is gradually quenched according to the Co(II) aqueous solution content, which may recommend it as a method of detection of Co(II) presence in waste water.

D-P2P-Sim+: A novel distributed framework for P2P protocols performance testing	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Distributed storage systems; IoT and Web 2.0 applications; P2P data management	OVERLAY	In recent technologies like IoT (Internet of Things) and Web 2.0, a critical problem arises with respect to storing and processing the large amount of collected data. In this paper we develop and evaluate distributed infrastructures for storing and processing large amount of such data. We present a distributed framework that supports customized deployment of a variety of indexing engines over million-node overlays. The proposed framework provides the appropriate integrated set of tools that allows applications processing large amount of data, to evaluate and test the performance of various application protocols for very large scale deployments (multi million nodes-billions of keys). The key aim is to provide the appropriate environment that contributes in taking decisions regarding the choice of the protocol in storage P2P systems for a variety of big data applications. Using lightweight and efficient collection mechanisms, our system enables real-time registration of multiple measures, integrating support for real-life parameters such as node failure models and recovery strategies. Experiments have been performed at the PlanetLab network and at a typical research laboratory in order to verify scalability and show maximum re-usability of our setup.

J	Guan, F; Zhang, Q				Guan, Fei; Zhang, Qiang			A Desirability Function-Based Relatively Optimal Interval Core Model and an Algorithm for Fuzzy Profit Allocation Problems of Enterprise Strategy Alliance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						cooperation games; desirability function; fuzzy cooperation games; Enterprise strategic alliance; fuzzy decision-making		Enterprise strategic alliance is a win-win business competition mode that has been developed in both academia and industry. How to allocate total profit fairly in an uncertain environment, however, is an important factor affecting the stability of the strategic alliance. To handle this problem, this paper proposes a new interval number ranking method based on synthesis effect function in which four basic principles to construct an appropriate synthesis effect function are developed. Using the new interval number ranking method, this paper defines a new concept of interval core. The necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee that the interval core is nonempty is also discussed and addressed using a special kind of additive synthesis effect function. A relatively optimal interval core model and an algorithm are developed to solve the proposed fuzzy allocation problem. Finally, a case study is presented to validate the proposed model and algorithm. Data analysis shows that we can obtain the only fuzzy allocation result by choosing an appropriate desirability function. The result indicates that our model has better operability and interpretability than existing methods, and thus can serve as a guideline for developing different fuzzy allocation methods.

This has equally been a major issue among the environmentalists and allied professionals in developing countries such as Nigeria. Consequently, this paper relied on extensive literature search through published books, journals, and periodicals. It critically explores the influencing role plays by science and technology in a sustainable environment integrated with appropriate open space planning and management. It identified and discussed the strategic imperatives for sustainable development, and recommends the need for the government of developing countries to initiate an effective policy formulation with follow-up in this regard. In view of this, desirous efforts will be geared towards matching up with open space planning and managements, as already been practised in the developed countries.

The purpose of the study was to understand the nature of the relationship between organizational strategy and its orientation. Organizational strategy was conceptualized as the intended and realized strategies directed toward the accomplishment of NGO mission. In order to measure intended and realized strategies, a survey instrument was used to collect information about strategic plan implementation (intended strategy) and the strategic orientation (realized strategy). The measure of strategic orientation was based on Miles and Snow's self-typing paragraph method. The study indicated that having a strategic plan (intended strategy) has value, though no association was found between the way strategy was initially formulated and the strategic orientation that emerged in the organization.

J	Ben Abdallah, A				Ben Abdallah, Asma			Socio-Political Identity Display in the Palestinian Israeli Conflict: Arafat's Siege Speech	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMANITIES AND CULTURAL STUDIES			English	Article						pronouns; Social Acting; Impression Management; Social Identity Theory; Socio-Political Identity Display (SPID)		International law is frequently used to propose solutions for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, although enforcement mechanisms are weak. The result was a break-up of the peace process and a violent spiral of escalation. The impossibility to reach a compromise and the failure of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in 2000-2001 played a central role in feeding the simultaneous outbreak of the Palestinian-Israeli war. This paper builds on the work of Ben Abdallah (2005) that investigated both quantitatively and qualitatively the pronominal choices of Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in their speeches in the year 2001 to gain insights into self-and other presentation, ideological thinking towards 'terrorism', and their socio-political affiliations. In this paper, I turn my attention toward two strands of my dissertation research, which delve into the use of the discourse-pragmatic construct of 'socio-political identity display' (SPID) along with Goffman's (Goffman, 1959, 1974, 1981) concepts of 'social acting', and 'impression management' by applying them to a political speech Arafat delivered in 2001 while under siege. This venue of analysis showed that through the strategic recurrent use of the first person singular and plural pronouns, Arafat is 'stage-managing' (Goffman, 1959, 1974, 1981) his audience and disclosing his micro-affiliations as a Palestinian, a leader, a legend but more importantly a political actor. This supports the claim that pronouns do not just do referring work but can also do identity work (Malone 1997; Ben Abdallah, 2005).

The regulation previously only permitted a 20 per cent allocation. Establishing the optimal foreign allocation for South African portfolio managers given the 25 per cent upper bound is an important consideration for strategic portfolio planning. In this paper we consider two methodological approaches to establish a strategic foreign allocation weight. Our first approach considers the strategic role of foreign investment in South African global balanced portfolios by using a mean-variance efficient frontier framework over a long-term period. We also implement a second assessment methodology that utilises a non-parametric procedure. Both the mean-variance and the non-parametric methodology yield compelling evidence for the foreign allocation to be set at the maximum allowable bound of 25 per cent.

J	Buil-Gazol, P; Roger-Loppacher, O				Buil-Gazol, Pilar; Roger-Loppacher, Olga			Environment and public relations: strategic planning in environmental communication campaigns in Spain	REVISTA MEDITERRANEA COMUNICACION-JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION			Spanish	Article						Communication campaigns; corporate communication; environmental communication; public relations; stakeholders; strategy		Environment is all around us since companies and organizations develop their mission in a political, economic and natural space. In fact, citizens ask for a healthier context and the Administration organizes campaigns in order to obtain sustainable behaviors. Moreover, companies introduce sustainability in their corporative culture. Therefore, if the latter take care of the environment, it is means a positive value, thus, it is reflected in the main index of reputational organization within enterprises. The focus of this research is on the study of the planning there is behind an environmental communication campaign, in other words, which are the steps followed in order to achieve a global environmental commitment. With this objective in mind from May 2013 to May 2014, we collected a sample of questionnaires conducted to several heads of communication who work for organizations with sustainable behavior. In this sense, our results seem to indicate that environmental communication campaigns follow all the steps in the planning process, but they adopt an instrumental view of the public. The conclusions have been reached provide elements of information that are useful of those involved in the management of environmental communication campaigns.

J	Chang, LH; Chen, YS; Liu, HL				Chang, Li-Hui; Chen, Ye-Sho; Liu, Hsi-Lin			Explaining innovation in tourism-retailing contexts by applying Simon's Sciences of the Artificial	JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Entrepreneurship; Strategy; Innovation; Customer service life cycle; Distributed cognition; Docility		Purpose - This study aims to use Simon's theory of strategies to explain Ever Rich's strategies for introducing innovation. Ever Rich is a very successful duty-free shop in Taiwan that makes profits by improving airport lobby/terminals and enhancing Taiwan's tourism brand image. This study shows a design artifact to explain Ever Rich's strategies for introducing innovation. The design artifact is based on Herbert Simon's classical work of Sciences of the Artificial. The design artifact is also grounded in the theories of customer service life cycle, input-process-output model of strategic entrepreneurship and docility-based distributed cognition. Design/methodology/approach - The authors interviewed the executive management with the pre-determined 14 questions regarding resource inputs, processes of resource orchestration and outputs. Findings - Introducing innovation requires appropriate strategies. Based on Herbert Simon's research on "Science of the Artificial", this case shows a design artifact of strategies for introducing innovation. The design artifact is in line with Ever Rich's corporate philosophy, including training and education of duty-free professionals, customer-oriented services, guarantee stringent quality control of products, newness and innovation and contributions to community. The design artifact, therefore, serves as a source of discovery with benefits for knowledge-building and relationship-building that are useful for students and practitioners. Practical implications - The success of this case and the reasons of success can be an inspiration for others. Originality/value - A significant contribution of the paper is that the design artifact serves as a source of discovery with benefits for knowledge-building and relationship-building that are useful both for students and practitioners.

J	Czarczynska, A				Czarczynska, Anna			EU corporate social responsibility regulations vs. practice in the private and public sector	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						corporate social responsibility; CSR; strategic analysis; EU policy		As a background in this paper, I explore the definition of corporate social performance based on the CSR concept described as the "configuration of the principles of social responsibility, processes of social responsiveness and policies, programmes and observable outcomes as they relate to the firm's societal relationships" (Wood, 1991). The article is based on the stakeholder analysis theory used as a tool of strategic management processes evaluation. In the CSR performance I would like to incorporate the needs of those who have a 'stake' or an interest in the process. This method is used only in a descriptive way, however further research based on quantitative analysis is also possible. The quantitative research is related only to the Polish market and shows consumer awareness of CSR practises. However, the aim of this paper is to identify the trends, tensions and processes connected with a company's social responsibility performance at a legal and practical level.

The author analyzes the situation in the Russian society to identify factors that determine the directions of universities development under difficult market relations and constant competition. The mechanisms of university changes, although based on different criteria, generally aim at achieving the strategic guideline of innovative development to help the university to take its rightful place in the educational market and to become financially independent, for which it is necessary to design the future of universities according to the chosen path of the development. The author describes some probable scenarios for the development of the higher education system, based on the events and reforms in the scientific and educational fields, taking into account the current socioeconomic and political situation. The author makes an analogy between the predicted vectors of the development of the higher education institutions and new types of universities as a basis of the proposed scenarios implementation. Thus, the general scenario of the higher education system development on the basis of research universities is complemented by alternative scenarios based on new types of universities entrepreneurial, innovative, network, and virtual. Such scenarios are relevant as indicators of understanding the state of the higher education system and can help to find new ways of university management and optimal forms of university functioning.

J	Degos, JG; Levant, Y				Degos, Jean-Guy; Levant, Yves			The units of value added to offset the cost calculation shortcomings: an opportunity for small African businesses	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AUDITING AND FINANCE			English	Article						Africa; profitability curves; cost management; small and medium enterprise; SME; cost-price relationship; units of value added; UVA		Firms are growing increasingly complex and have to respond very quickly to changes in an unstable environment. Using reliable costing methods, they must be able to clearly identify sources of losses and profit. This requires them to adopt a radical change of perspective, replacing calculation of the margins on products with calculation of the profit on each sale. This type of analysis, facilitated by the UVA costing method, can inform businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which of their customers are profitable and which generate losses, which of their products and services are not meeting customer demand, which prices are not reflecting the costs borne, which processes must be improved, and so on. Firms can thus make operational and strategic decisions to improve profitability. SMEs in African countries, facing a difficult business context, could usefully take advantage of these systems, which are appropriate for their structures.

J	Demchenko, N; Kozyryeva, O				Demchenko, Nataliya; Kozyryeva, Olena			STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP OF UKRAINE: DECLARATIONS AND REALITIES	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						globalization; strategic partners; global market; economic; political and military spheres; cooperation; integration; competitiveness		The strategic partnership of cooperation is a higher step than conventional relationships. Conditioned by specific interests of the parties, such cooperation is possible between those partners who have mutual territorial claims and have mutual commitment to the territorial integrity. At the same time with many partners (it's quantity is about 20), Ukraine has no simple partnership and cooperation, a lot of them reseived the status of "strategic partners, but often they are not the states, whose national interests in strategic areas correspondes to the current interests of Ukraine. It should be noted that today among the countries that have been declared as the strategic partners of Ukraine, not all of them support national interests in the present. Ukraine, appeared as an independent state, began use new methods of international cooperation, without adequately developed strategy for their use. Some problems facing the country, can be solved, other must be taken into account in determining its development strategy. Therefore, the subject of the research is global and specific problems that consider issues of economic security and partnership in Ukraine in modern conditions. The objective of the paper is to study options for a strategic partnership in Ukraine by improving the institutional mechanism to coordinate the integration processes. The article is based on studies of foreign and domestic scientists. Practical implications. Formation of effective international cooperation of Ukraine in the context of globalization, the choice of strategic partners on the basis of mutually beneficial cooperation. Results. The analysis of Ukraine's cooperation with Russia; the features of the largest modern regional associations; reasonably objective need for Ukraine's integration into the regional associations; recommendations on the necessary measures to accelerate the process of deepening Ukraine's integration with the EU.

J	Carreno, IDG				Garcia Carreno, Ingrid del Valle			Present and future of social entrepreneurship: alternative theories and research	JOURNAL FOR EDUCATORS TEACHERS AND TRAINERS			English	Article						Entrepreneurship theory; Discovery theory; Creation theory; Social enterprise		The process of creating new value is central to the field of entrepreneurship. Social entrepreneurship has led to an emerging stream of research that is of interest to researchers and academics in management, strategic management, and entrepreneurship. To understand theories on social entrepreneurship, two internally consistent theories are presented describing how entrepreneurial opportunities are formed, and the discovery theory and creation theory are described. The implications of these theories are listed, along with a discussion of some of their broader theoretical implications for the fields of entrepreneurship and strategic management. Within the field of social entrepreneurship an emerging area of investigation can be found in the entrepreneurship and not-for-profit marketing literatures. A review of the literature in a number of domains reveals that it is fragmented and that there is no coherent theoretical framework. In particular, current conceptualizations of social entrepreneurship fail to adequately consider the unique characteristics of social entrepreneurs and the context within which they must operate. This paper addresses the implications for social entrepreneurship theory and management practice, and discusses policy directions.

J	Guo, D; Zhang, CQ				Guo, Dan; Zhang, Changqing			Evaluation of Cost Management Controlling System in Petroleum Enterprise	OPEN PETROLEUM ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Cost; cost avoidance; cost control; cost management; evaluation		In this paper, for the implementation and supervision of the strategic management, we proposed a model that will evaluate cost management controlling system under various market scenarios in petroleum enterprises. The outlined model classified cost controlling methods into five grades In the different strategy. These methods includes origin management, activity improvement, activity chain optimization, value engineering, cost variance analysis, budget management, performance evaluation system and incentive mechanism, quality cost management, funds operation and human capital operation. The model assigned a value to each grade by expert scoring method, and calculated the score of cost management controlling system by formulas. It is the conclusion that if the score > 0, cost management controlling system made positive contribution to strategy; If the score < 0, negative contribution to strategy. The use and benefits of the proposed model are illustrated on a case of The Fourth Oil Extraction Plant of Daqing Oilfield Company Limited..

We studied the 30-day mortality after ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or myocardial infarction in individuals with or without AD. Methods: An exposure matched cohort of all Finnish community-dwellers diagnosed with clinically verified AD in 2005-2012 (n = 73,005) and 1-4 matched comparison persons/AD-affected person (n = 215,449). Data on 30-day mortality after ischemic stroke (n = 16,419; deaths: n = 2,748), hemorrhagic stroke (n = 3,570; deaths: n = 1,224), and myocardial infarction (n = 15,304; deaths: n = 3,804) were obtained from the National Hospital Discharge register. The main analyses were restricted to first-ever events. Results: Persons with AD had slightly higher 30-day mortality after ischemic stroke (adjusted HR 1.36, 95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.24,1.49), hemorrhagic stroke (adjusted HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.98,1.25), or myocardial infarction (adjusted HR, 1.40, 9% CI 1.30,1.51). The associations were not affected by age, gender, or co-morbidities and remained similar when patients with previous ischemic strokes or infarctions were included. The absolute risk increase in 30-day mortality after ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and myocardial infarction were 4.9% (95% CI 3.3,6.5), 3.3% (95% CI -1.6,8.2), and 7.5% (95% CI 5.0,10.0), respectively. Conclusions: Although the 30-day mortality was somewhat higher in the AD cohort, the absolute differences were small indicating that acute treatment was not notably inferior in AD patients. The slightly higher mortality was not explained by co-morbidities but may reflect the higher mortality of AD persons in general, or treatment practice of patients with severe cognitive impairment.

In this sense, it has changed the profile of this teacher, indicating a different character based on the facilitation and management of student learning and motivation, which leads us to a new understanding of their paper, tutor new profile and new strategies for the development of knowledge. The purpose of your role is clear, their action in tutorials practices has consequences on the quality of teaching. The results of the assessment of students regarding the roles, responsibilities and functions of teacher mentoring of university teachers are presented in this article. For data collection a questionnaire has been used in quantitative and qualitative closed and open items where students point to a teacher training in new personality profiles and professionalism. The results reveal several interesting facts: the need for training in new teaching and organizational strategies for improving their teaching management, empathetic relationships with students, based on collaboration personality and treatment and the development of a tutorial -based feature in strategic planning. The importance of this study lies in the provision and demand that the students giving her own voice for the development of teaching and mentoring in higher education and improving their teaching management.

J	Hu, L				Hu, Ling			An approach to evaluating the enterprise strategic crisis management with uncertain linguistic information	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Decision making; uncertain linguistic information; probabilistic; generalized probabilistic uncertain linguistic weighted average (GP-ULWA) operator; generalized probabilistic uncertain linguistic ordered weighted average (GP-ULOWA) operator; enterprise strategic crisis management	GROUP DECISION-MAKING; AGGREGATION OPERATORS; DEA	With respect to decision making problems by using probabilities and information that can be represented with linguistic labels, some new decision analysis is proposed. Firstly, we shall develop two new aggregation operators: generalized probabilistic uncertain linguistic weighted average (GP-ULWA) operator and generalized probabilistic uncertain linguistic ordered weighted average (GP-ULOWA) operator. These operators use the WA operator, the OWA operator, uncertain linguistic information and probabilistic information. They are quite useful because they can assess the uncertain information within the problem by using both linguistic labels and the probabilistic information that considers the attitudinal character of the decision maker. In these approaches, alternative appraisal values are calculated by the aggregation of uncertain linguistic information. Thus, the ranking of alternative or selection of the most desirable alternative(s) is obtained by the comparison of uncertain linguistic information. Finally, we give an illustrative example for evaluating the enterprise strategic crisis management with uncertain linguistic information to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its feasibility and practicality.

J	Kastrati, V				Kastrati, Valon			Management of Energy Costs for Sme's, Evidence From Kosova Economic Environment	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						energy costs; business strategy; performance criteria; questionnaire research; SMEs	SUPPLY CHAINS	This paper deals with issues of strategic management, particularly strategic planning of energy costs and their effect on the overall performance of businesses. It is based on empirical results of the original research survey Enterprise Surveys data for Republic of Kosova,. performed via questionnaire surveys by the World Bank in three rounds during years 2005, 2009 and 2013. The analyses presented in the paper were conducted on the third round sample of organizations operating mostly in the SME sector in the Republic of Kosova. Among typical obstacles to the economic environment we found also the energy problem, specifically the power outages that increase further the costs of power supply for SME's. These phenomena not only create a state of turmoil and turbulence in the competitive environment and generate changes in market conditions, but require changes and development in organizations. In these circumstances organizations are forced to adapt costly solutions, like generators or other tools to guarantee the customer satisfaction. Therefore to achieve any competitive advantage, organizations must take in consideration the current economic environment. The interdependence between the level of energy costs and enterprise performance criteria is examined with the use of some hypotheses. The results are commented and discussed.

J	Kislov, D; Horobei, Y				Kislov, Denis; Horobei, Yevgenia			ADVERTISING AGENCY MARKETING MANAGEMENT	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						sales volume; management of goods; pricing; marketing department; advertising services; advertising agency		Goal of the paper. The goal of this article is to define the nature, specific features and factors pertaining to the advertising agency marketing management. One of the tools is the use of non-standard approaches to management of advertising agencies, which under certain conditions makes it possible to improve the situation and to bring the agency to a new higher level as well as to improve the efficiency of its functioning in the conditions of transformational economy of Ukraine. Methodology. Monitoring of the marketing behavior of agencies that promote advertising services. The results of monitoring and analysis demonstrated that the majority of agencies have a disorganized approach to the agency marketing, which results in sporadic activities related to the use and organization of agency marketing. Only individual agencies begin to form their own marketing strategy for the implementation of which marketing budgets are allocated. The main marketing functions of a Ukrainian advertising agency have been identified. Practical value. Rapid development of technologies, sophistication and increased variety of goods and services, reduction of their life cycle, higher customer demands, the growth of volume and speed of obtaining information, increased competition - all these changes that are taking place in the external environment make the Ukrainian companies that provide advertising services search for new approaches to ensure better adaptation to these conditions. Uncertainty, unpredictability and instability of the external environment will continue to grow. Therefore, the companies that provide advertising services need to constantly adapt not only to the existing conditions but also ensure that they are able to quickly react in the future. The basic precondition for success is stability of the quality that is achieved through strategic planning, fine-tuned search system, efficient management, which encourages creation of a position of quality assurance director or manager, who would be responsible for the standards of client service quality. According to the monitoring results, agencies begin to form their own marketing strategies, for the implementation of which marketing budgets are allocated, which will facilitate the search for new customers. Relevance/originality. Based on the received data, further development of the advertising market may be determined by the development of other commodity markets, and first of all - by an increased volume of the consumer goods market.

THE STRATEGIC MARKETING FUNCTION IN DYNAMIC MARKETS	POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						marketing function evolution; marketing tipping points; lifecycle model; big bang model; market dynamics		Marketing has a glamorous role in the business world. It is at the forefront of the firm-market interaction, it represents the best compensated activity in an organization. Marketing assumes a leadership role in the firm and sets the tone of the strategic plans. The approach and strategies seen in marketing throughout the market lifecycle are influenced by factors and players, which significantly curtail its role and circumscribe its influence. This article examines the evolution, along the market lifecycle, of marketing's role and spheres of influence, and proposes two predictive mechanisms that allow for the estimation of "tipping points" for the different characteristics that define the marketing profile along the lifecycle. We introduce the big bang model of market dynamics and examine the behavior of the marketing function depending where the firm is relative to sink holes, transient and steady states and how the market is pulsing defines the marketing priorities. The article further identifies the factors circumscribing the functions and freedoms of marketing along the lifecycle in hi-tech, to develop a clear picture of the various roles that marketing plays as the firm proceeds along the lifecycle from incubation to market maturity.

PROBLEM-ORIENTED ANALYSIS OF EFFICIENCY OF GOLD MINING ENTERPRISES IN THE FAR EAST	JOURNAL OF MINING INSTITUTE			Russian	Article						gold mining industry; economic development; alluvial deposits of gold; method of a "problem tree"; method of a "tree of goals"		The subject of the article is the analysis of a current state and efficiency of economic activity of gold mining enterprises in the Far East engaged in development of gold-bearing placers. The purpose of the article is research on the situation developing in modern gold mining, identification and systematization of factors influencing the efficiency of the enterprise activity. Methods of economic, system and strategic analysis and graphic modeling are used in this article. The following scientific results are received in the course of the research: the relations between criteria "cause-consequence" and "means-effects" are established based on a graphic method, the hierarchy of institutional and organizational, economic, and scientific and technical problems is determined and presented in the form of a cause-and-effect chart of a "problem tree", which logically results in the creation of a "tree of goals". This approach allows structuring goals of the gold mining enterprises aimed at increasing their economic efficiency hierarchically. The scope of the results received may contribute to elaboration of a number of measures on the development of the gold mining enterprises of the Far East region at the level of government or municipal institutions. The approaches and methods stated in the article can be used during the planning, forecast and assessment of economic efficiency of the enterprises. The results presented in the article allow further study into problems of forming effective management of the gold mining enterprises.	[Kradenykh, I.

Design/methodology/approach - This study employs a set of time series data (91 observations) on average monthly hotel room rates to generate an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Models (ARIMA) forecasting model. Findings - Through the employment of 74 percent observations, with 26 percent withhold for evaluation checking, six best models are identified from 50 models under study. The final model reports a high level of predictive accuracy and provides useful insights for hoteliers to form business strategies. Originality/value - This research provides a well-defined model to forecast the room rate of three-star hotels in the city. The research findings provide good ground for strategic management of the industry, in which there is an imbalance between demand and supply of hotel accommodations. In addition, being the first of its kind in one of the largest gaming revenue generation city in the world, this research provides valuable information for further research of its kind in the future.

In this paper, a fast-updated high-utility-pattern trees for transaction deletion (FUHUP-DEL) algorithm is proposed to handle transaction deletion for efficiently updating discovered high utility itemsets in decremental mining. The HUP-tree structure is adopted in the proposed algorithm for reducing the computations of re-scan database in a level-wise way. Experiments show that the proposed FUHUP-DEL algorithm outperforms the batch two-phase approach.

J	Louca, F				Louca, Francisco			The improbable econometric connection - Schumpeter and Frisch at the midnight of the century	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS			English	Article						Frisch; Schumpeter; Econometrics; Business Cycle		When Joseph Schumpeter and Ragnar Frisch first met in the autumn of 1927 at Harvard, both the ensuing personal friendship and the intense academic and institutional cooperation were highly unlikely. Schumpeter, who was by then preparing to leave Germany for his American life-long exile, was twelve years older than Frisch and had a previous intense career as the most frequently quoted economist in the first decades of the century, only to be shadowed later by the glittering triumph of Keynes's 'General Theory'. Comparatively, Frisch was just a young economist with no publications. Furthermore, Frisch invited his colleague to the most daring adventure: to create econometrics as the tool to reconstruct economics as a mathematically based social science. Surprisingly, Schumpeter, who was totally innocent of mathematics, embarked and enthusiastically supported the construction and workings of the Econometric Society, which would become the Olympus of economics since those frightful years of what a novelist called the "midnight of the century". This paper presents some evidence on this improbable econometric connection.

J	Marcone, MR				Marcone, Maria Rosaria			Creativity-decision processes: the case of Italian luxury fashion	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL FASHION MARKETING			English	Article						global marketing; SMEs' internationalization; business relationships; supply-chain relationships; relationship management		This study analyzes Italian knitwear manufacturers that operate in international consumer and business markets, and assesses the different forms of competition that exist between them. The purpose of the research is to analyze the different positioning of these firms within the chain of production that they belong to. A framework is proposed to study firms that deal with fashion, that operate in different competitive contexts and that have to launch new products frequently. Sweater manufacturers adopt marketing strategies that are based on a constant growth of marketing capacity (specialized and structural), in order to allow them to enjoy a leading role in micro-segments of world markets. Through multiple case studies, this paper provides a deeper understanding of the strategic decisions regarding marketing and productive activities. The purpose of the paper is to describe and discuss how the integration of intra-organizational competence affects the creative processes of firms. The paper contributes to research on creativity through discussing the issue in the context of interaction and provides many implications for management practice and avenues for future academic research.

J	Maslak, A; Kutscenko, I				Maslak, Aleksandr; Kutscenko, Ihor			DEVELOPMENT OF GRAIN MARKET IN UKRAINE	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						grain market; integrated agricultural farm; grain production; the world grain market		The subject of the research is a set of theoretical, methodological and practical fundamentals of organizational and economic functioning are integrated agricultural formations in the grain market of Ukraine. The methodological basis of research is the complex analysis of economic processes in the grain market in Ukraine and the world. During research we used such methods as method of systematization and comparison, statistic, economic, balance, constructive, target-oriented, and the methods of induction and deduction, analogy and comparison. Main aim of this article is the analysis of the situation on the grain market in Ukraine, defining the role of integrated agricultural formations in this market, improving the organizational-economic mechanism of its functioning, identifies ways of improving the competitiveness of Ukraine among world exporters of grain. Using results of the studies we examined trends grain market in Ukraine; influence of businesses in grain production; analysis of constraints to improve production efficiency of grain; defined domestic (internal) needs of grain in Ukraine; assessed the status and expediency transformation infrastructure of the grain market of Ukraine; defined priority directions of development of the grain market in Ukraine. As a result of the preparation of articles, it is obtained the following conclusions: Ukraine is the world's largest producers and exporters of grain, the production of integrated agricultural units to a third of the total grain; technical condition of farm does not meet the needs of production; the domestic market is unable to provide the existing demand for grain production, contributing to export growth; Ukraine has a number of problems due to increased grain production, namely the shortage of storage capacity for the storage of grain, limited performance transshipment of grain in port elevators and imperfection and depreciation of transport systems; solving the existing problems is possible through the implementation of state and regional programs, implementation of joint projects with partner companies and the purchase of equipment and facilities through leasing programs. As a result of the development of logistics infrastructure of grain market provides employment generation, value-added products that will increase revenues to the state and local budgets. Besides Ukraine reach the strategic goal of producing 80 mln. tons of grain and strengthen positions in the global agricultural market.

A test excavation of this previously unknown source/quarry was undertaken in 1976 to obtain a sample of artefacts to compare with what appeared to be lithologically identical basaltic glass cores and flakes from excavations at two nearby rockshelters used by adze makers as base camps. Comprehensive geochemical analyses of a small sample of flakes from the source and base camps confirm that all but one of the rockshelter artefacts are local basaltic glass and that the manufacture and use of basaltic glass tools was therefore an activity embedded in the adze quarry 'industry'. The one anomalous sample, which was selected for analysis because of its unusually vitreous appearance, is a trachytic glass flake sourced to Pu'u Wa'awa'a, a volcanic cone located similar to 40 km west of the Mauna Kea Adze Quarry and source of the best quality and most used volcanic glass on Hawai'i Island. The provenance of the Pu'u Wa'awa'a flake suggests that it was an offering or gift and not part of some down-the-line exchange network, as often assumed in the case of volcanic glass artefacts found in coastal habitation sites. Although there is no conclusive evidence that any of the Mauna Kea basaltic glass was exported, it is a possibilty that needs to be considered in future studies of volcanic glass distribution patterns, which appear to have been far more complicated than previously thought. To characterise sources/quarries and to provide robust matches of artefacts to sources, we advocate using comprehensive geochemical techniques and reporting the data in full-not just mid-Z elements and select oxide values.

J	Mitike, NM				Mitike, Nigussie Meshesha			Information Management and Strategic Communication for Institutional Change in Ethiopia: The Case of SNNPRs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE DIGITAL AGE			English	Article						Business Processing and Reengineering (BPR); Effectiveness; Efficiency Information Management; Information Communication; Institution; Strategic Communication; System		The growing need for institutional effectiveness and efficiency in meeting institutionally set objectives cannot be seen independent of information management and strategic communication. As a result, information management and strategic communication practices have become quite useful to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of institutions. To find out the information management and strategic communication situation in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Regional state (SNNPRs) in Ethiopia, primary data were collected from nine zonal departments in selected three most populated zones namely Sidama, Gedeo and Hadiya among the 13 zones in the regional state. The study of the information management and strategic communication activities in the three zones was believed to indicate the overall performance in the public administration practices of the region where the three zones alone comprised almost 40% from 15 million population of the regional state. As part of the study, some secondary sources were also used and relevant literature was reviewed. Then, the data were classified using sex, age, qualification and experience, and also analyzed using frequency, percentage, mean value, standard deviation, T-test and correlation analysis. Based on the analysis, it was found out that the information management and strategic communication practice was less effective due to its intuitional placement where the section was given no or little importance in the institutional administration. Besides, it was found out that most of the challenges and problems related to Business Processing and Reengineering (BPR) implementation for institutional change in the state were quite related to the marginalization of information management and communication practices along with the inadequacy of finance and office equipment, and poor office situations like in the case of Gedeo zone. Actually there was better institutional change/reform in the public administration practices of Hadiya zone than the rest two zones. There was a strong correlation among the zones in information exchange level and challenges of BPR implementation. There was, indeed, about 63% success story in reducing process time, and more than 50% in reducing cost and about 50% success in proper use of resources and creating accountability in Hadiya zone though much more is expected. Sidama and Gedeo zones seem to have by far low successes in BPR implementation.

J	Mohamed, A				Mohamed, Abdulghany			The international business environment: a proposed analytical framework	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						context; dynamic; global business environment; GBE; holistic; analytical framework; international business environment; IBE	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONAL ENVIRONMENT; COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT; GLOBAL STRATEGY; TIME; SPACE; CONTEXT; NGOS; FDI	International business environment (IBE) literature is characterised by the lack of a holistic analytical framework. Drawing on a wide range of perspectives, this study aspires to fill the lacuna by offering a holistic, dynamic analytical framework for the systematic study of the IBE. The IBE is broadly conceived as a spatial-temporally multilayered, multi-actor context imbued and stitched up with ideas, institutions and non-institutional structures wherein international business (IB) actors, activities and processes are constituted and occur. Application of the proposed framework will potentially ensure a better understanding of the IBE, support endeavours that focus attention on the IBE as an object of inquiry in its own right, and ultimately foster better managerial and public policy decision-making.

J	Molnar, WA; De Smet, D				Molnar, Wolfgang Alfred; De Smet, Dieter			BUSINESS-IT ALIGNMENT WITHIN THE LUXEMBOURGISH FINANCIAL SECTOR: A CASE-STUDY	IADIS-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Business-IT; Alignment; Finance; Entanglement; Case-Study	RESOURCE DEPENDENCE; STRATEGIC CHOICE; SYSTEMS; TECHNOLOGY; SOCIOMATERIALITY; MANAGEMENT	Entanglement in practice is a particular perspective on technology and perceives human practices and IT interrelated. How business-IT alignment is perceived from this research perspective is explored with this interpretive case-study within the financial sector. Employees from different departments and different hierarchy levels in one company were interviewed. The amassed qualitative data was analyzed through a coding approach and conceptualizations were derived. The study identified institutionalized features, change legacies and communication as influential for business-IT alignment. Researchers perceive a tripartite formation composed of human, business and IT, when they explore business-IT alignment. Aligned business and IT may serve as scaffolding. The paper indicates that the organizational state of business-IT alignment is important to distinguish the respective need of reflexive capabilities of human actors. Large tensions between business and IT require extensive reflexive capabilities, when actors need to elicit more carefully the respective requirements in a given situation.

Accordingly, given the time left, it should comply with environmental laws and regulations and design the pattern of trade with other countries to be consistent with environmental criteria and standards. In this regard, the present study was carried out to investigate the opportunities and obstacles of Iran's accession to the WTO. For this purpose, the key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats toward presenting an environmental management plan for Iran's accession to the WTO were initially examined using matrices for external factor evaluation (EFE) and internal factor evaluation (IFE). Thereafter, the most applicable strategies were identified through SWOT Analysis. Subsequently, the identified strategies were prioritized based on the quantitative strategic planning matrix (QSPM). The obtained results indicated that the strategies "Institutionalizing the environmental laws and regulations based on international consensus" with a score of 5.42, and "investment in ecotourism development based on the natural attractions of Iran," with a score of 5.38 were selected as the best strategies among the existing alternatives.

J	Mountcastle, P; Yahanpath, N				Mountcastle, Paul; Yahanpath, Noel			HOW APPROPRIATE IS THE BALANCED SCORECARD AS AN INTERNAL REPORTING FRAMEWORK?	ASIA-PACIFIC MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING JOURNAL			English	Article						balanced scorecard; internal reporting framework; health services; strategic management	IMPLEMENTATION; BSC	The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) remains a popular strategic management tool. This tool has also been successfully applied in the healthcare industry aside from various business fields. However, the use of BSC in New Zealand lacks evidence, thus requiring further research into the applicability of this tool in the country, especially when the Hawke's Bay District Health Board (HB DHB) sought to improve its internal reporting framework. In this case, we investigated whether BSC could be applied by HB DHB in pursuing its objective. Given the lack of an international standard for healthcare BSC design, we developed a framework that comprised the appropriate perspectives to meet the needs and internal reporting requirements of HB DHB. BSC was eventually proven suitable for this application, and the framework of Marr (2015) was identified as a suitable framework for such an application. While remaining to the original design of Kaplan and Norton, the framework has been modified to fit the needs of HB DHB by changing the customer perspective to community and by adopting Marr's positioning of the financial perspective along with three other perspectives to reflect the importance of both financial constraints and objectives to the whole operation.

J	Mukherjee, S; Mukherjee, K				Mukherjee, Santanu; Mukherjee, Kampan			An empirical study on possible consequences of implementing offshore information technology outsourcing strategy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						consequences; benefits; factor; strategy; information technology outsourcing; ITO; offshore; outcomes; strategic decision		Offshore information technology outsourcing (ITO) is one of the crucial strategic decisions pertaining to both the service provider and the client organisations. In light of the recent political clamour against the offshore ITO, it is quite logical for the decision-makers to reconsider all the established perceptions relating to its positive and negative consequences on the various stakeholders. The key issue in this debate is the worthiness of offshore ITO from the perspectives of both the contractual parties involved. Therefore, the intention of this article is to explore some specific parameters with the help of an empirical study to assess the benefits and possible challenges of offshore ITO. Although the study is based on the provider side perspectives, it helps discover two sets of factors, which not only explain various facets of offshore ITO outcomes but may help enhance the long-term visibility of its benefits and negative consequences from decision-makers' standpoint.

The present study investigates the current status of head office of Ardabil Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation through analyzing internal and external environmental factors. To this end, a sequential mixed method design was used for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting research question. Sixty-eight employees participated in the study.

J	Natarajan, VK; Kanmony, JC				Natarajan, Vinodh K.; Kanmony, J. Cyril			Factors influencing organisational innovation in wind farms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND LEARNING			English	Article						administrative innovation; organisational innovation; wind farm; technical innovation		Innovation in the wind energy sector is dominated by R&D investments in wind turbine industry. The focus on product innovation is high owing to the huge setup cost involved in setting up a wind turbine. However, not much work is found among literature on innovation adopted by wind firms that own these wind turbines. This study proposes a framework for analysing innovations adopted by wind firms by constructing an organisational innovation measurement model. The study examines the effects of various factors on two types of innovation, administrative and technical, in the selected sample of wind firms. The results indicate that factors that are favourable to administrative innovations differ from those that are conducive to technological innovation. Three variables are significant predictors of administrative innovation: organisational characteristic innovation and strategic innovation. Process innovation contributes significantly to the model of technical innovation. Moreover, the results of the study show that more importance is given to technical innovation than administrative innovation in wind farms.

The financial prospect of UE 2007-2013 is the first in which Poland participates as a full member of the EU. To thanks of the integration with EU, Poland gained to access for the new financial funds which was allowed to the development of the regions. It was showed that the sports and recreational infrastructure for years 2007-2013 in the strategic documents played conclusory position. The joining to the preparations for the new period programming of the EU budget, filling the duty of every Member State were imposing the obligation of the preparing the strategic documents which were to include the tasks of financing both from the European support. The work of the local governments of the Silesian voivodeship at the partnership of the employees indicated a big mobility and prospect to correct expending of European Union Funds of the past perspective. To analyse the past perspective can ascertain that it was the period of intensive activities of the local government of the Silesian voivodeship in enlisting of the European Union Funds which were the main beneficiaries of the financial prospective in years 2007-2013.

J	Oberg, C; Shih, TTY				Oberg, Christina; Shih, Tommy Tsung-Ying			Strategy in an ambiguous innovation environment The case of a Taiwanese biopharmaceutical firm	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategy; Network; Taiwan; Emerging market; Logic; Biopharmaceutical; Ambiguity		Purpose - An ambiguous environment indicates how rules and interests may not be outspoken or clear. In an emerging industry sector, such ambiguity may follow from different sets of rules to adapt to, changes to these rules, and how various parties surrounding a firm act based on these rules and individual interests, interaction goals, and priorities. The purpose of this paper is to describe and discuss how a company balances its relationships with others to achieve strategic intentions in an ambiguous environment. Specifically, the paper focusses on innovation in the biopharmaceutical sector in Taiwan. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical part of the paper is based on a single case study portraying multiple parties surrounding an innovative Taiwanese biopharmaceutical firm. Findings - The paper points to how partner selection and interaction are highly affected by the ambiguous environment. Ambiguity leads to transactional exchanges on the domestic level, while the focal firm engages in collaborative, relational interaction with international parties to accomplish innovations. Originality/value - The paper contributes to literature on company strategies in emerging sectors with its specific focus on innovation strategies, and how a company balances ways of interacting based on an ambiguous environment. To Asian management research, contributions include an in-depth description of company-level strategizing in Taiwan.

It is generally accepted that asphalt concrete (AC) mixtures made with recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) promotes sustainable construction. However, our analysis identifies an environmental downside: increased consumption of bitumen from these mixtures and therefore increased consumption of fossil fuels. Technical solutions to limit RCA content in mixtures, control their impurities, control the fraction in which it is used, and the application of pretreatments are emerging as potential tools to limit the consumption of bitumen by AC made with RCA. From the management point of view, we also propose as policy a revision of the technical specifications to adapt the technical standards to the particularities of RCA. This paper makes a contribution in joining both engineering and economic approaches in order to make proposals for construction management only using recycled materials economically feasible.

J	Prikhodko, YS				Prikhodko, Yulia S.			ACTIVITY OF REGIONAL AUTHORITIES IN THE NORTH OF WESTERN SIBERIA IN REALIZATION OF THE STATE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE XX CENTURY.	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY			Russian	Article						North of Western Siberia; environmental policy		Article discussed problems of activity of regional authorities in realization of the state environmental policy in the north of Western Siberia in the second half of the XX century. Chronological frameworks of research cover the period from 1950th to the 2000th. This chronological interval was chosen because soviet environmental policy had been developing from the middle of the XX century. The main problem of the environmental policy development was state approach to nature management. In 1990th new state system was create in Russia. This system was based on transfer to regions some of the government functions. It could give region the possibility to make their own environmental policy. Territorial framework covers the territory of the North of Western Siberia. This region had a strategic importance for development of national economy from the discovery of oil and gas fields. The main goal of the state policy was to stimulate economic growth. The questions of environmental protection often were without any attention. The main reason of the environmental deterioration was industrial development of the North of Western Siberia. Fistful function of environmental protection was transferred to industrial factory. They had to control level of environmental pollution. However interests of departments were concentrated on performance of the operational indexes lowered by the State Planning Committee of RSFSR. Nature protection activity at the factory was carried out poorly. Nature protection activity of regional authorities during the second half of the XX century was reduced to obey the environmental law. The specialized commissions on conservation for control this law were created in region. The commissions made decisions on the punishment of the ecological legislation. The decisions of the commission had mainly declarative character because any effective law mechanism did not exist. The industrial factories were the main reason of environmental pollution, and they ignore the nature protection requirements. The new period in development of region environmental legislation started in early 1990th. In this time new federal state system was created. But that did not allow changing environmental situation in region. The peculiarity of this is that based on various archival documents the author makes an attempt to analyze state measures for nature protection and rational nature management in the territory of the North of Western Siberia in second half of XX century.

Two dimensions of their international maturity (involvement in foreign activities, and length of time over which they are undertaken) are applied in a comparative analysis covering strategic orientation, policies and procedures concerning international assignments, and use of particular forms of IAs. In part, it confirmed the validity of the assumption of congruity between a company's international maturity and approach to managing IAs.

J	Schneider, S				Schneider, S.			Analysis of Management Practice Strategic Planning: a comprehensive approach	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategic plan; stakeholder; crafted; pillars; elements; implementation; monitoring		Objective: To describe a comprehensive approach to crafting a strategic plan for a health service organisation which incorporates the pillars of: corporate governance; service master planning; facilities master planning; business planning; clinical governance; and organisational culture to provide the framework for its development and subsequent implementation. Background: As a senior heath executive spanning 25 years, the author experienced first hand the negative consequences of a health service not developing and maintaining a comprehensive contemporary strategic plan through key stakeholder engagement. Throughout subsequent appointments the author refined his approach to strategic planning and draws on these experiences to write this article. Discussion: Each of the pillars is briefly discussed for the purposes of providing a definition and a considered rationale for inclusion in a comprehensive strategic plan. As each pillar is discussed, a number of elements are identified which are considered essential inclusions in this planning framework. Five key additional considerations that must be made during the development or crafting and implementation of a health service identified and discussed. These are: multi-site organisation; functional integration; resource requirements; implementation; and monitoring the strategy. Conclusion: The crafting of a contemporary strategic plan with six inherent pillars through key stakeholder engagement is fundamental for any organisation's long-term survival. Multi-site and functional integration challenges, resource implications, implementation needs and monitoring requirements are crucial in ensuring the successful implementation of such a strategic plan. Through the development and successful implementation of such a plan, a health service organisation will have significantly greater confidence that the risks it confronts in the future are mitigated. A health service's board and its executive would have every justification to be optimistic of their ability to future proof the organisation when adopting the strategic planning approach discussed in this article.

J	Schreiber, D				Schreiber, Dusan			The Study of Symbolic Influence of the Leader in the Process of Knowledge Management	REVISTA GESTAO & TECNOLOGIA-JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY			Portuguese	Article						Knowledge management; leadership; Organizations		The exhaustion of the classical model of organizational management, based on the production capacity, due to the increasing complexity of the economic and social context, required of organizations effort and dedication to perform strategic repositioning and adopt new ways of thinking about the business and coordination of the organizational resources. The temporary advantages such as access to suppliers and consumers markets, production based on scale and scope, among others, ceased to have effect, being needed conception of the strategic design based on innovation and knowledge management, typifying the new trends for the constitution of competitive advantage. These issues, among others, led to the construction of this paper, based on the results of the research conducted through multiple case studies and narrative analysis method in the two companies studied, BETA and GAMMA. Altogether were performed twelve interviews with managers and technical people of the R&D area, which is the unit responsible for consolidating the foundation of organizational knowledge, in order to allow its use in the process of designing of the new products and processes. Despite the similarities presented by the two organizations in their historical trajectory, the method and techniques used in the knowledge management process differ, influencing performance and results. The content of the narratives has highlighted the origin of the differentiation in the possible action of the leader on the subjective dimension in the management process, due to perceptual and interpretative bias that arose during the research.

Effect of Heifer Frame Score on Growth, Fertility, and Economics	ASIAN-AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Beef Heifer; Heifer Production Economics; Fertility; Frame Score; Increasing Energy Management; Percent Mature Body Weight	BEEF HEIFERS; REPRODUCTIVE-PERFORMANCE; DEVELOPMENT SYSTEMS; BODY-WEIGHT; PUBERTY; SUPPLEMENTATION; REQUIREMENTS; PREGNANCY; DATE; COWS	A non-traditional forage-based protocol was employed to evaluate replacement heifer growth, fertility, and economics between small frame (SF, 3.50; n = 50) and large frame (LF, 5.56; n = 50) heifers using three increasing gain growth phases. Preceding an 85 d growing-breeding period (Phase 3; P3) the heifers were managed as a common group for Phases 1 and 2 (P1 and P2). During Pl, heifers grazed common fields of unharvested corn and corn residue (total digestible nutrients [TDN] 56%) with supplemental hay. For P2, heifers grazed early spring crested wheatgrass pasture (CWG; TDN 62%) that was followed by the final P3 drylot growing and breeding period (TDN 68%). Small frame heifers were lighter at the end of P1 in May and at the start of P3 breeding in August (p = 0.0002). Percent of mature body weight (BW) at the end of P1 (209 d) was 48.7% and 46.8%, respectively, for the SF and LF heifers and the percent pubertal was lower for SF than for LF heifers (18.0% vs 40.0%; p = 0.02). At breeding initiation (P3), the percentage of mature BW was 57.8 and 57.2 and the percentage pubertal was 90.0 and 96.0 (p = 0.07) for the SF and LF heifers, respectively; a 5-fold increase for SF heifers. Breeding cycle pregnancy on days 21, 42, and 63, and total percent pregnant did not differ (p>0.10). In drylot, SF heifer dry matter intake (DMI) was 20.1% less (p = 0.001) and feed cost/d was 20.3% lower (p = 0.001), but feed cost/kg of gain did not differ between SF and LF heifers (p = 0.41). Economically important live animal measurements for muscling were measured in May and at the end of the study in October. SF heifers had greater L. dorsi muscle area per unit of BW than LF heifers (p = 0.03). Small frame heifer value was lower at weaning (p = 0.005) and the non-pregnant ending heifer value was lower for SF heifers than for the LF heifers (p = 0.005). However, the total development cost was lower for SF heifers (p = 0.001) and the net cost per pregnant heifer, after accounting for the sale of non-pregnant heifers, was lower for SF heifers (p = 0.004). These data suggest that high breeding efficiency can be attained among March-April born SF and LF virgin heifers when transitioned to a more favorable May-June calving period through the strategic use of grazed and harvested forages resulting in a lower net cost per pregnant SF heifer.

J	Soderman, S; Dolles, H				Soderman, Sten; Dolles, Harald			Unlocking advertising, activation and sponsorship in an emerging market The case of Beijing Olympics	SPORT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						China; Advertising strategy; Beijing Olympic games; Sponsorship; Sponsorship activation; Sponsorship evaluation	BRAND; INTERNATIONALIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; RELIABILITY; GAMES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe and explain the advertising behavior seen as an activation strategy performed by Olympic sponsors in an emerging market context. It provides insights into the strategic goals related to sponsorship. Design/methodology/approach - The longitudinal approach taken opens the possibility to explore the dynamics of the strategies of Chinese as well as foreign firms in China. Theories on how sponsorship works cannot assist in explaining outcomes of sponsor-linked marketing, and since the actors involved rarely divulge their genuine intentions or their reciprocal contractual arrangements with the sponsored property, a new methodology has to be developed. A means-objective framework of sponsoring consists of six factors, which were applied to analyze 739 advertisements, articles and press releases collected from Chinese newspapers and Chinese official web pages covering a period of eight years (2001-2008) prior to the Olympic Games in Beijing. Based on a qualitative content analysis and nine means- objectives combinations in sponsorship patterns the authors discovered four dominant advertising strategies. Findings - Lead-time is a key concept when analyzing sponsor advertising strategies. The authors conclude from the longitudinal data that the time gap between signing the contract and the dates of the event influences the strategy of the sponsoring corporations. The authors also observe that the advertising content changes over time and the sponsors craft different "advertising strategies" in different periods. Within this context the authors categorized two different advertising strategies. The sponsors are assumed to conduct a "Short Advertising Strategy" different from the "Long Advertising Strategy." Both are examples of activation strategies. Originality/value - Advertising strategies and activation seems to be dependent on the lead- time to the Olympic Games and the level of internationalization of the sponsoring firm.

HYDROGEOLOGICAL STUDY OF NATURAL SULPHUROUS COMPONENTS FROM THE NICOLINA AREA OF IASI MUNICIPALITY USED IN THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						natural sulphurous water; clayey-sulphurous mud; pelotherapy; mineral water analyses	PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; PAIN MANAGEMENT; PELOIDS; PELOTHERAPY; OSTEOARTHRITIS; HYDROTHERAPY; CLAYS; WATER; SPAS	The present study describes the evolution of water quality indicators of natural sulphurous waters and the mud formed from natural clay in the Nicolina area of Iasi Municipality, Romania. The natural sulphurous components are the drilling water and the mud formed in the presence of clay and organic materials provided by biomass (vegetation) under UV/IR sunlight irradiation. The period of investigation ranged from 1965 to 2014. The changes over time of the sulphurous water composition and the main characteristics of the mud are illustrated in this paper, which points out the effects on the environment and the environmental issues generated from the past to the present respectively. By increasing environmental management it should be possible to ensure the enhancement of the balneotherapeutic and touristic potential of Iasi Municipality.

Therefore, the essential question in any organization is how to achieve and maintain competitive advantage. In this regard, strategic leaders should first logically consider what will bring a substantial advantage to the organization in a long-term, and then start with the process of creating the strategy. To achieve this, researchers in the field of managerial issues offer a concept of continuous process that begins by looking at the customers pattern, through defining the competitive environment and the place of business in it and finally categorizing several strategic business conditions, as a precondition for election and creation of a competitive strategy. This process can be presented as the "funnel for selection of competitive strategy", in whose widest part we can put the customer matrix, in the middle part we can place definitions of the business outlook of the business and the position of the organization in those perspectives. In order to implement the "Funnel method" of strategic planning teams we need accurate, timely and relevant information based on which we can bring appropriate organizational strategy. The subject of this paper is displaying the Funnel method for selection of the competitive strategy, and presentation of the situation in some of the organizations in the Pelagonija region, related to the way and the information used to create organizational strategies through the Funnel method.

Motivation and satisfaction of employees become the basis of modern organizations. Motivated employees today represent a strategic resource which gain a competitive advantage for the organization. If someone wants to motivate others, must first be able to motivate yourself. That means that if in organization exists motivated staff, there must be a motivated manager who will be able to launch employees. The aim of this paper is to emphasizes the importance of material motivation for successful business of a large company that had in the past significant organizational change. Through unstructured interviews were collected data on which was investigated the hypothesis that the material motivation of the most important holder for successful reorganization on the example of leading Serbian company for exploration, production and refining of oil and gas NIS. From the above it can be concluded that highquality human resources management involves proper motivation system, that has been based on material incentives. In this paper, attention will be focused on monetary motivation and how a wellestablished system of material incentives can lead to the great success of the company that had a significant reorganization in the past. It will be shown in detail the system of material incentives and the positive results which obtained by this system, when it comes to the business of the company, which today is the most desirable employer in Serbia and the region. The paper should emphasize the benefits of a fair system of motivation which brings to an organization, but also to encourage further thinking to improve this aspect of motivation, which is a prerequisite for successful business and the basis for all other activities in the HRM. The analysis results indeed show that a system of material incentives in NIS is the holder of a successful reorganization, and the proof is the business with profit even in times of economic crisis, and consequently the high salaries that are above the national average.

This study advances a framework that depicts channel structure as being composed of two dimensions: operational integration and joint decision-making. It also illustrates the sociopolitical, economic, and strategic antecedents to channel structure. Using finite mixture regression, differences in various types of manufacturer retailer channel structure are explored. Based on this analysis, six classes of manufacturer retailer channel structures are identified.

Innovative Instrument, Classification, Model and Methodology for Strategic Modeling for Technology New Ventures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						strategic; modeling; management; e-system; research; technology new ventures; technology; entrepreneurship; strategies; canvas; methodology		This work presents the results from a research in the field of strategy modeling for technology new ventures in its final stage -presenting an innovative e-system for strategy modeling for technology new ventures (technology startup companies) developed by the author. The innovative methodology for strategy modeling for technology new ventures is developed following a developed by the author innovative algorithm for strategy modeling for technological startup companies and number of instruments and process modifications implemented in the system in the strategic modeling process. The algorithm and all included in the system instruments and modifications in the process, have been confirmed by a research, conducted amongst 153 participants (136 from Bulgaria and 17 from other countries). The presented system is aimed towards introducing a unified system for strategic modeling, including a smooth transition between the processes of strategic analysis, strategic formulation and strategic implementation. This is achieved by: (1) introducing an unified instrument for strategic analysis and identification of the key characteristics and competitive advantages for the companies, developed by the author; (2) application of a threedimentional framework for categorisation of the basic typological strategies for technology new ventures, together with further full development of the typological strategies, based on a modified model and process of balanced scorecard methodology, developed by the author and (3) a process guiding the entrepreneurs from typological strategies characteristics towards concrete strategies characteristics and activities for their technology new ventures, which represents a smooth transition towards the next stage of strategic management the strategic implementation stage. The presented innovative e-system can be used as a basis for further development of the innovative e-system for strategy modeling towards a full strategic management e-system, specifically designed for technology new ventures, covering all stages of the strategic management process.

DOCKING ZONES OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACHIEVING DEVELOPMENT TARGETS OF COMMODITY COMPANIES	JOURNAL OF MINING INSTITUTE			Russian	Article						Strategy-2020; value of the company; targets; balanced scorecard; responsibility; targeting		Case studies show the urgency of the problem of securing zones of responsibility for achieving development targets. The article gives a current practice analysis in the domestic economy. The importance for companies not only to assess past achievements, but to study the characteristics of the development prospects is stressed. The article deals with questions of quantification, targeting and allocation of responsibility for achieving development targets of commodity companies. The cost of oil and gas companies as a criterion for its development is analized. The impact of various factors on the cost is assessed. The article high lightens the role of external factors in the current period as well as the importance of the fundamental ones. It also shows the possibility of calculating out come indicators by different measures in the face of negative factors. The system of targeted strategic and planning targets for quantitative assessment of the strategic goal sand objectives to achieve the misdemonstrated. For example, the largest Russian company Gazprom shows one way to implement such an approach. Gazprom's system of targeted strategic, planning and monitoring indicators for quantifying the strategic objectives and ways of achieving the misshown and management based on targeting and consolidation of areas of responsibility is recommended.

COMMUNITY COLLEGES OF NORTH CAROLINA AND MASSACHUSETTS AS WORKFORCE TRAINING INSTITUTIONS FOR INNOVATIVE BIOTECHNOLOGICAL BUSINESS	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY			Russian	Article						innovations; biotechnology; North Carolina; Massachusetts		Workforce training is one of the most essential, strategic goals for innovation development. In the USA this issue is pressing because of growing international competition. Recently community colleges started to play one of the most important roles in this process. They were chosen by regional authorities as a tool for workforce training aimed at satisfying demand of biotechnology companies. Of great interest in this respect are two major biotechnological states in the USA: Massachusetts and North Carolina. By the beginning of 2000-s the production volume of biotechnological companies in Massachusetts and North Carolina increased rapidly and they urgently needed trained workers. Besides, interstate competition in biotechnologies exacerbated the issue. In 2001 Massachusetts launched Building Essential Skills Training Program. There were 6 areas of workforce training including biotechnology. The results of the program were controversial: good scores of participants didn't lead to creation of comprehensive system of workforce training on the basis of community colleges. In 2003 North Carolina released strategic plan on prospective economic development of the state. The main point of it was job creation through development of biotech and workforce training for biotech industry in community colleges. GoldenLEAF foundation in NC helped finance this program and it resulted in establishment of BioNetwork. This network consisted of 6 centers of excellence throughout the state. Success of this initiative was determined by historical role of community colleges in NC. Long tradition of partnership with the industry and government control over management and budget of community colleges became key success factors. In 2004 non-government "Lumina" foundation launched federal program Achieving the Dream with the aim of improving curricula and organization structure reform of colleges in participating states. North Carolina joined the program in 2004 and Massachusetts in 2007. This program again drew attention of Massachusetts state government to community colleges. In 2009 Governor of Massachusetts Deval Patrick appointed R. Freeland to the position of Commissioner of Higher Education for Massachusetts. Freeland, in turn, initiated audit of all community colleges in state and developed general standards for college effectiveness measurement. Starting from that moment separate colleges have been transformed in complete system. In 2013 Governor Patrick signed the Massachusetts budget into law. According to the budget state community colleges changed their organization structure and would be governed by state government officials. This government control is much like of that in North Carolina. Massachusetts authorities followed NC and adjusted community colleges to workforce development system in order to satisfy the demand of their biotechnological business. Those measures of two states allowed them to remain leaders in biotech industry of the USA.

J	Wang, L; Makar, S				Wang, Li; Makar, Stephen			FX Cash Flow Risk Management: Financial Reporting Issues and Practical Implications	JOURNAL OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE			English	Article								Companies having foreign sales can avoid large fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange (FX) rates through the use of foreign exchange derivatives (FXDs). FXDs used to mitigate the effect of FX rate changes on forecasted transactions can qualify as cash flow hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133). According to SFAS 133, the mark-to-market (MTM) gains/losses on effective cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income on the balance sheet, instead of on the income statement. This article explains how CFOs and treasurers may benefit from understanding the strategic and practical implications of reporting foreign-exchange hedges, including the disclosure of hedge ratio data (i.e., the extent of cash flow hedge use).

Red Queen Takes White Knight: The Commercialisation of Accounting Education in Australia	AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL			English	Article						Accounting education; adaptive and maladaptive consequences; commercialisation; higher education; Red Queen theory; strategic management	ARMS RACES; ORGANIZATIONS; MANAGEMENT	This paper investigates the adaptive and maladaptive consequences of changes resulting from the commercialisation of Australian universities, specifically their accounting schools, and aims to identify the organisational changes triggered by competition that affect the growth of universities over time. The paper synthesises organisational learning theory, benchmarking theory, mimetic isomorphism and institutional theories, which are presented as "the Red Queen", itself an evolutionary theory; this synthesis provides the theoretical underpinning. The Red Queen theory posits that competition triggers organisational learning, which in turn intensifies competition in rivals that ultimately triggers an adaptive response. This self-reinforcing process produces results that may be adaptive or maladaptive. There is evidence to support that "running fast" in terms of Red Queen evolution theory has allowed some universities to place competitive pressure on rivals and achieve elite levels of publications, international accreditation and improved international rankings. This search for improvement, driven by commercialisation, provided ways to improve performance, thus improving the university's competitive strength. There is also evidence to support the belief that "running slow" provides maladaptive consequences that could affect growth rates, quality and staff performance. The use of the Red Queen hypothesis provides an evolutionary approach to the study of strategy, strategic change and organisations. This provides an opportunity to examine competition in universities as a force that continually disturbs equilibrium.	[Watts, Ted; Bowrey, Graham; McNair-Connolly, C.

The infrainguinal vasculature, especially the superficial femoral artery (SFA), poses a significant challenge to successful long-term outcomes for a variety of reasons. Because some of these procedures have limited longevity, the management of patients that require reintervention is worthy of special consideration and strategic discussion. This article reviews the risks and failure modes of SFA interventions and the treatment options and techniques for reinterventions.	[Cafasso, D.

J	Dasgupta, M				Dasgupta, Meeta			Unveiling Technology Acquisition and Deployment Decisions for Technological Innovation: An Exploratory Study in Indian Power Distribution Firms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Technological innovation; technology acquisition; technology deployment; business strategy; collaboration	PERFORMANCE; MODEL	How managers take decisions with respect to the acquisition and deployment of technology to promote technological innovation is central to the field of strategic management. The main objective of this research is to explore how technology decisions drive technological innovation in organizations. Technology decisions have been explored through the lens of substance and enactment of technology strategy. The paper reports findings from three Indian Power Distribution Firms that have taken various initiatives to turn around the dilapidated power distribution situation in the country. The study in addition to proposing typologies of technology acquisition and deployment strategies on the basis of patterns discovered also puts forth propositions linking technological innovation to the typologies. A modified model linking the technological innovation process to the substance and enactment of technology strategy has also been proposed.

Transmission Rights to the Electrical Transmission Grid in the Post Liberalization Era	JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY			English	Article						Electricity transmission systems; Transmission rights; Electricity markets; Electricity liberalization; Congestion management		The electric power industry has been consistently moving away from vertically integrated, centrally regulated system towards a market- based, competitively organized industry. There remain unfulfilled requirements for institutional reform. In this paper, we confront existing and developing congestion management techniques in conjunction with the principal problems of electricity reform. The approaches adopted vary across countries in terms of market and system operation, property rights, and investment incentives. A number of key concepts emerge as central to the organization of the grid, including locational marginal pricing, transmission capacity rights, and compensation for wire ownership. Nonetheless, a set of core, generalizable problems in congestion management with regard to congestion pricing and market power abuse remain. Endowing network operations, contract networks, and financial transmission rights are considered. Contract networks entail the market allocation of long-term capacity rights for transmission. An alternative approach involves endowing a network operator with joint matchmaking and dispatch responsibilities. This approach involves considerable centralization and network oversight. The indirect implementation of transmission rights has not been proven to remove the chief difficulties. A final and more elaborate market mechanism, namely financial transmission rights, which involves the joint trading of energy and transmission capacity, has been showcased. In this paper, we describe the principal strategic management issues in the electrical transmission grid. Secondly, we highlight the principal policy options in conjunction with the described strategic management issues. Lastly, we explicate the current situation involving congestion management towards a pan-European power grid. The challenges ahead are discussed.

J	Pai, VS; Subramanian, R				Pai, V. S.; Subramanian, Ram			Kraft Foods, Inc. in India - The Cadbury Acquisition	ASIAN CASE RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article								In mid-April 2011, Anand Kripalu, President, South Asia and Indo-China at Kraft Foods, Inc. (KFI) and Managing Director of Cadbury India, faced a critical challenge that had to do with the growth of the company's India operations. Soon after its 2010 acquisition of Cadbury plc, the U. K.-based confectionery giant, Irene Rosenfeld, the CEO of KFI, had publicly stated that she expected the developing markets division of KFI to contribute substantially to the company's overall growth rate. Since its acquisition of Cadbury's, KFI had launched only Tang and Oreo's in the Indian market. It had, instead, concentrated on further strengthening Cadbury's portfolio of products. Kripalu was expected to present the strategic plan for India in his upcoming meeting with Sanjay Khosla, KFI's head of developing markets, and Kripalu's immediate boss, Pradeep Pant, KFI's President of Asia-Pacific, at the end of the month. As he reviewed the current performance of the India operations, Kripalu wondered whether his plan should call for using Cadbury's dominant position in the Indian market to meet growth targets or push for KFI to launch more of its global brands in the market.

J	Seferaj, K				Seferaj, Klodjan			Sustainable Development Aspects in Cross-Border Cooperation Programmes: The Case of Macedonia and Albania	ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN AFFAIRS			English	Article						cross-border cooperation; EU; evaluation; sustainable development		The cross-border area between Albania and Macedonia can be considered as a region with agrarian or industrial-agrarian economy, although the overall picture should take into account significant contrasts within the region, between the two countries, but also between the southern and northern part, and between mountainous areas and lowlands. Agriculture, agribusiness, light industry, mining, energy production and tourism are the main economic sectors, which also have the biggest potential in the cross-border region. Both countries are gaining experience in EU funded cross-border cooperation programmes with other neighbouring countries and with each other. The scope of the research is the evaluation and analysis of the Integrated Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) Cross-border Cooperation (CBC) Programme Macedonia-Albania 2007-2013 and its sustainable development aspects. The research is trying to assess the impact of the programme since its start in 2007 and the impact of the implemented grants on the sustainable development. The importance of the sustainable development aspect is recognized and is formally included into various national strategic documents, however implementation is often problematic and sustainability aspects need to be examined on a more concrete level. The methodology used was qualitative with research tools such as desk studies of relevant program documentation, strategic and planning documentation and other relevant published materials. The desk review considered well over 40 documents relevant to the program, most of which were shared by the Ministry of European Integration (MoEI) and other actors.

J	Shaw, P				Shaw, Philip			INTERTEXTUALITY, INTERGENERICITY, AND INTERDISCURSIVITY IN THE MANAGEMENT SUMMARIES AND CLIENT RESPONSIBILITIES SECTIONS OF SOFTWARE DESIGN PROPOSALS	ESP TODAY-JOURNAL OF ENGLISH FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES AT TERTIARY LEVEL			English	Article						genre; workplace; intertextuality; intergenericity; interdiscursivity; proposal	GENRE; DISCOURSE	Workplaces are characterised by a particular assemblage of genres and particular composing practices. These are usually very local, in the sense that they are different in different workplaces, and also very different from the genres and practices to be found in academia. In this article an account is given of text analysis and interviews which focus on the interrrelations of genres and discourses in the writing practices in a software company in England. The emphasis is on the function and re- use of formulaic text, using the example of two parts of the software design proposal: the Management Summary and Client Responsibilities. The aim is to examine how the composing practices in the company compare with those familiar from academic writing. The design proposals are shown to be texts characterised by multiple authorship, discourse which varies across sections, and above all by strategic re- use of text. Since none of these are characteristics of academic writing, ESP teaching has to ensure that it does not impose misleading requirements on students, and pedagogic applications are suggested.

Typical and atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome: a brief case comparison report for nurses	RENAL SOCIETY OF AUSTRALASIA JOURNAL			English	Article						Haemolytic uraemic syndrome; plasma exchange; peritoneal dialysis; nursing		Background: Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is one of the main causes of acute kidney injury in children. It is a multifaceted disease, characterised by microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopaenia. It can often affect multiple organ systems, including the central nervous and renal systems. Objectives: Two case studies are presented that highlight the differences between typical and atypical HUS.Treatment and prognosis differ, depending on the type of HUS. These complex case studies will demonstrate the strategic medical and nursing management required. Key messages: 'Typical HUS starts with severe symptoms but it is the atypical form that has long-term consequences. It is important to ascertain the correct diagnosis early and initiate appropriate therapy accordingly. Multidisciplinary care, including nurses, is involved in the management of care for these children and can support and educate their families to assist them through this debilitating disease. New treatments such as Eculizimab hold new promise in the treatment of atypical HUS.

J	Kaur, CR				Kaur, Cheryl Rita			Progress, Challenges and the Way Forward on Ballast Water Management in Malaysia	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES			English	Article						Ballast Water Convention; implementation; progress; issues; challenges		It is generally understood that international shipping is fairly amenable to management strategies aimed at preventing the introduction of non-indigenous aquatic species through the discharge of ballast water. Malaysia's strategic location along the Straits of Malacca (SUM), one of the world's busiest waterways, emphasises the need for strategies to manage ballast water issues for both national and international shipping. The International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water 2004 (BWM 2004) was ratified by Malaysia in 2010, although it has not yet been enforced for ships operating in her waters. This paper reviews progress oil the implementation of the BWM 2004 provisions as well as issues and challenges faced by the various stakeholders in its implementation at the national level. Current and planned actions and programmes by Malaysia to comply with the provisions of BWM 2004 to address local concerns are also discussed.

J	Machado, LP; Almeida, A				Machado, Luiz Pinto; Almeida, Antonio			The On-going Process of Reinventing Classic Tourism Destinations - The Case of Nordic Tourists in Madeira Island	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM			English	Article						reinventing classic destinations; Madeira Island; second homes; Nordic tourists	2ND HOME TOURISM; PLACE ATTACHMENT; RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE; SENSITIVE QUESTIONS; INVOLVEMENT; LANDSCAPE; MANAGEMENT; EFFICIENCY; ATTITUDES; OWNERS	In this paper, we analyze the effect of tourism experience-related variables on Nordic visitors' interest in Madeira as a potential second home destination, within the framework of the reinvention of classic tourism destinations as attractive residential areas and tourism hot spots. Over time, Madeira has experienced a sharp decline in terms of the numbers of Nordic visitors, which has prompted local experts to discuss alternative paths to re-attract past visitors back to the island. The second home market was considered one of the viable solutions among the several alternatives considered to address problems of declining market shares. In order to assess the conditioning factors of success in this market niche, we applied a questionnaire to a sample of Nordic visitors to assess their interest in the local second home market. The econometric approach retained in this study is based on the randomized response to take into account potential bias in the data. We suggest that Nordic visitors are only marginally interested in Madeira for second home purposes, which does not mean that we are dealing with a hopeless situation. Further development in this sector can only be reached in the medium term based on sustained quality improvements along with long-term strategic thinking focused on developing a feeling of attachment among potential second home owners.

J	Fagundes, PD; Padilha, ACM; Padula, AD				Fagundes, Paloma de Mattos; Machado Padilha, Ana Claudia; Padula, Antonio Domingos			Co-marketing alliances in the Brazilian biofuel sector: An analysis based on strategic alliances	SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY			English	Article						biofuels; strategic alliances for cooperation; co-marketing alliances	COOPERATION; ENERGY; CHINA	Brazil is among the world's largest producers of biofuels. This situation stimulates agreements and strategic alliances for cooperation between countries where biofuel feedstocks are scarce and those where they are abundant. Thus, this study aims to analyze the strategic alliances for cooperation between countries for biofuel production. This research study was conducted using information from the website of the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and national and international journals, on strategic alliances for cooperation between Brazil and other countries for biofuel production since 2006. It is known that those involved in the strengthening of strategic alliances for cooperation, can work together through the formation of co-marketing alliances, can contribute to the global development of the biofuel industry. They can also extend this development to other agribusiness chains. Finally, co-marketing alliances lead to actions that benefit all countries and participants in the biofuel production chain, as well as society as a whole.

J	Rashidi, Z; Zaki, S				Rashidi, Zaki; Zaki, Sajida			A SWOT Analysis of Collaborative Strategies between Engineering Universities and Industry in Pakistan	MEHRAN UNIVERSITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						SWOT Analysis; Collaboration; Research and Practice; Engineering Education		Collaboration among academia and industry is a long aspiring vision of every country to promote innovation and commercialization. A deeper analysis of collaborative efforts among this triad may reveal significant aspects to look for well informed decision making. The purpose of this research is to conduct the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis of collaboration in engineering education, research and practices in Pakistan. The study attempts to identify strengths and weaknesses of the current collaborative strategies; opportunities for establishing strong and rewarding relationships, and threats that may hinder development of this association. It further provides practical schema to establish productive association between the two partners through creative leadership, effective strategic partnership, and systematic modus operandi to way forward with implications for academics, researchers, and industry. The research is qualitative in nature, based on interpretivist approach. The data is collected by using focus group and semi-structured interviews of experts in industry and academia; primary data obtained by these tools is analyzed by using thematic analysis through open and axial coding. The study identifies the barriers in collaborative efforts, and delineates the roles of industry and academia to overcome these barriers along with SWOT matrix in the context of Pakistan.

RISUS-JOURNAL ON INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY			Portuguese	Article						associativism; solidarity economy; financial record; administrative management; sustainability		Recyclable materials collectors represent the possibility of social reinsertion based on what is discarded by the society. At the same time, this path is not built without mishaps or challenges. ACIMAR - Association of Recyclable Materials Collectors of Itajuba was founded in 2007, from the organization of workers/collectors which used to collect recyclables at the streets of Itajuba, southern Minas Gerais state, and its 'lixao' (place where trash is thrown away without any caution). Nowadays, the association is made up of about 30 members. The main goal of this work is to assess how the evolution of recyclable materials and the respective income generated from it, has influenced the sustainability of ACIMAR. Data used in this work were stored in the association's cashbook, with the respectives invoices and financial records. As a general rule, it can be stated that these data underestimate the recyclable materials records, and the associated income, as in many cases there were situations in which sales were carried out, loans were withdrawn, acquisition of food for the group's meals, among others, without the adequate financial register. ACIMAR contribution towards recyclable materials processing in Itajuba is still modest, being 6% of the maximum recyclable waste, in a situation where all the processed material would come from domestic origin. The total amount of recyclable materials has presented a negative trend of about 220 kg/month between August 2009 and February 2013, especially due to the poor performance from August 2012 onwards. Paper and paperboard are the most common recyclable materials processed by ACIMAR. Thus, their market prices are strategic for the sustainability of the association, in a way that negotiations on these materials should be taken with criteria and ideally inclue different buyers, where best selling conditions must be prioritized. A change in the profile of materials processed by the association is taking place, with the majority of the materials being collected directly on streets, based on household and commerce origins and a positive trend of 200 kg/month, rather than coming from institutional donations, such as those coming from industries. The distinction between autonomy or dependence of ACIMAR in the future is directly related to how its associates deal and rank the importance of an effective and transparent financial control, performed by the own group.

In this scientific meeting the nature and the role of the University of the Future was discussed and evaluated. Being all the authors of this paper members of the Groups of Studies and Research on interdisciplinarity (GEPI - PUCSP), their thoughts and reflexions reflect their interdisciplinary attitude and interpretation as regards the theme that go against the disciplinary intentions launched by the research institutes in Brazil, (CAPES, CNPq, FAPESP, among others), signalling a new route for the University, the students, and for Education in the future as a whole.

BSC is a well-known methodology for measuring performances enabling organizations to learn how well they are doing. In this paper, "BSC for IS" will be proposed in order to measure the IS impact on the achievement of organizations' business goals. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to present the original procedure which is used to enhance the BSC methodology in planning the optimal targets of IS performances value in order to maximize the organization's effectiveness. Methods/Approach: The method used in this paper is the quantitative methodology - linear programming. In the case study, linear programming is used for optimizing organization's strategic performance. Results: Results are shown on the example of a case study national park. An optimal performance value for the strategic objective has been calculated, as well as an optimal performance value for each DO (derived objective). Results are calculated in Excel, using Solver Add-in. Conclusions: The presentation of methodology through the case study of a national park shows that this methodology, though it requires a high level of formalisation, provides a very transparent performance calculation.

Managing Spares Inventory Through Life Time Value Assessment	OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Spare Parts Management; Real Option Analysis; Spare Part Classification		Spare Parts Management in capital equipment intensive industries is a critical differentiating factor. As we work in a resource crunch environment, we have changed the vantage point for spares management system in this study. Determining the value and usefulness of the spare parts and understanding which spare part is more valuable should guide us in committing resource. Instead of looking from the vantage point of the equipment where the spare is used this spare considers spare part as an investment based on its value. Real Option Analysis has been identified in the literature as a quantitative means to evaluate the flexibility inherent in the decision making process. By adopting a real options framework we develop a model that incorporates the demand uncertainty and the financial implications involved. The value derived in terms of asset utilization determines the viability of this investment. Thus, the concept of 'Spares Life Time Value' has been proposed based on an analogy from 'Customer life time value'. In this model the contribution of spare part reduces to an argument which can be used for strategic insights and decision making. The concept has been illustrated through a case study on the issue of spare resource allocation.

The study made use of survey method over one hundred and ninety-three respondents. Pearson's correlation and regression analysis were used to analyze the data obtained. The existing relationship stemming from the results revealed that top management factor, organizational system, and departmental connectivity are important antecedent factors that determine the success or otherwise of strategic orientation dimensions. The study recommends that the calibre of the top management personnel and the internal cohesion between departments should be considered a critical variable in the adoption of particular orientation.

With this change, the importance of securing competitive funding increased significantly, and university researchers have had to devote more time to non- research burdens related to obtaining competitive funds including project management and public engagement. In order to reduce the burden for researchers in Japan, MEXT launched a support program in 2011 called the "System to Develop and Secure University Research Administrators (URA)." Supported by the program, Kyoto University established The Kyoto University Research Administration Office (KURA) in April 2012 as a support organization to help with planning of research projects, obtaining research funding, project execution, and public engagement. In this article, the strategic planning to implement the URA program at Kyoto University shall be described within the historical context of how the Japanese government decided to launch this support initiative.

J	Franco, S				Franco, Stefano			SOCIAL MOBILE MARKETING EVOLUTION OF COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES IN THE WEB 2.0 ERA	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Mobile Marketing; Social Marketing; New Media; Web 2.0; Smart City		Increasingly faster communicational streams - that ease interactions and allow agents to considerably enhance their own informational assets - characterize the era in which we live. The research about new media, mobile and social technologies is the driver of this changes that implements a revolution of the content management, of the information accessibility and of the relationships interactivity. These characteristics don't leave the agents unresponsive and it is interesting and fitting to understand the tools available to firms and institutions and the communicational and marketing policies that organizations put to use to achieve their goals. In this context we want to find strategic and operational models to support organizations decisions about markets and territories. The purpose of this article is to understand how small organizations can utilize networks that characterize new trends in marketing. We conclude by providing some thoughts on the future evolution of the research in this field also with reference to the smart city that can exploit social mobile marketing for promotion of the territory and social participation.

J	Tu, YY; Yuan, B; Cheng, ALP				Tu, Ying-Yi; Yuan, Benjamin; Cheng, Alfred Li-Ping			Product-Driven Technology Upgrade and the Branding Development: A Simulation	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP			English	Article						Branding Development; OEM-ODM-OPM-OBM Model; MATLAB Simulation; Standard Modular Systems (SMS); Integrated Production Systems (IPS)		This paper addresses an important but normally ignored capability development, the stage of original product manufacturing (OPM) in the stage of upgrading technology from ODM to OBM. We propose a four-stage "OEM-ODM-OPM-OBM" evolution model of technology upgrading and brand development. It explains the development strategies and patterns by technological firms in developing economies for developing their brands. The reason why many firms may fail in branding or err in long term strategy before they arrive at the OBM stage is because they ignore the selection of strategic patterns in the developmental phase of a new product. This acts as a barrier between ODM and OBM in the previously identified three-stage model of "OEM-ODM-OBM". This study constructs a model consisting of one brand-owning firm and two contract manufacturers with different technological levels in order to illuminate interactive effects at the technology market, contract manufacturing market, and product market levels. Scenario-based simulation and numerical analysis are employed in combination with this model to explore contract manufacturers' long-term optimal brand development strategies in lieu of brand-owning firms' countermeasures. We find contract manufacturers would adopt their optimal brand development strategies to move toward long-term brand development strategies through changing strategies in three turning points.

J	Vladimir, VM				Vladimir, Mirkin V.			ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY OF DEVELOPMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN THE POSTWAR USSR	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						telecommunications; radio-relay communication; multichannel communications		During the postwar years the Soviet telecommunications has undergone profound qualitative and quantitative changes. Its development during this period was determined by the rise of science as well as the rapid growth of certain sectors of the economy. Great positive influence had significant changes in the geographical distribution of productive forces, the development of new economic regions of industrial and agricultural production. One of the drivers of progress of the communication facilities were the achievements of national science and technology, in particular - radio engineering and electronic industry. Telecommunications management system included the following main units: USSR Ministry of Communications and its main (central) sector management; Administration of Commissioners of the Ministry of Communications of the USSR by the Councils of the Ministry in the Union Republics; regional government of the Ministry of Communications; county, city and district offices of the Ministry of Communications. Communication facilities in the period under review were classified primarily on the basis of their primary purpose and administrative and economic subordination. From this point of view, they were divided into two groups: public communication facilities and departmental or special purpose facilities. Ways of development of telecommunications in the second half of the last century, particularly in the 1960s-1980s, stages of the strategic objectives of the government in this sector were identified in a complex project of the Unified Automated Communication System (UACS). UACS project organically emerged from a planned economy and the political line of the USSR, took into account the possibility of financial, material and human resources. The primary strategic goal was to create a unified multi-channel network of telecommunications lines - primary network of the UACS. It was a network of typical transmission channels and group paths formed by a set of nodes, stations and signal telecommunication lines - cable, radio relay, air, etc. On its basis secondary networks were constructed. Thus, the fundamental direction of the development of telecommunications technology was the integration of various communication media, the creation of a network that could be used to transmit all kinds of information. Beginning with the integration of standard communication channels later this process affected the commutation stations.

On the other hand, extraction of necessary, appropriate information and turning them into the knowledge required by organizations for making decisions, visioning the strategic future, and creating competitive advantage calls for application of new methods. Data mining is the means used by organizations and managers to extract knowledge from a pile of information stored in a knowledge-base management system. The present survey study is a descriptive research. The statistical population for this research included 110 employees and managers of the headquarters of the Bank Saderat Iran. In order to discover facts and expand the questionnaire statements the principal component analysis (PCA) method and linear structural relations (LISREL) were employed. Research findings revealed that the data mining technique, as a very important means of knowledge management, leaves a positive significant effect on the attainment of knowledge management goals of organizations through usage of knowledge resources.

This study presents the process and outcomes of IT strategic planning undertaken at a pediatric hospital (PH) in Canada. Methods: A five-stage sequential and incremental process was adopted. Various tools / approaches were used including review of existing documentation, internal survey (n = 111), fifteen interviews, and twelve workshops. Results: IT strategic planning was informed by 230 individuals (12 percent of hospital community) and revealed consistency in the themes and concerns raised by participants (e. g., slow IT projects delivery rate, lack of understanding of IT priorities, strained communication with IT staff). Mobile and remote access to patients' information, and an integrated EMR were identified as top priorities. The methodology and used approach revealed effective, improved internal relationships, and ensured commitment to the final IT strategic plan. Several lessons were learned including: maintaining a dynamic approach capable of adapting to the fast technology evolution; involving stakeholders and ensuring continuous communication; using effective research tools to support strategic planning; and grounding the process and final product in existing models. Conclusions: This study contributes to the development of "best practices" in IT strategic planning, and illustrates "how" to apply the theoretical principles in this area. This is especially important as IT leaders are encouraged to integrate evidence-based management into their decision making and practices. The methodology and lessons learned may inform practitioners in other hospitals planning to engage in IT strategic planning in the future.

The development of intelligent technologies and specific supporting decision tools has been accelerated during the last ten years, so managers of all strategic levels should keep track of this development and have timely access to adequate modalities and quantity of knowledge necessary for the optimal business management. The domain of the required knowledge is broader at higher managerial positions, while at lower positions it becomes narrow so more profound knowledge of certain area is required. Consequently, managers should know what basic knowledge employees should develop on different hierarchical levels. The purpose of this paper is to provide insight into the domain of Decision Support Systems, which are, according to the authors, essential for understanding the importance and purpose of their usage. The following concepts have been discussed, due to their proved importance in Decision Support Systems, according to the previously analyzed corresponding literature: strategic methods, methods oriented to performance, measurements, techniques and specific tools. The paper elaborates on reasons of their usage, as well their interconnections. The dynamics of these concepts' development during the last two decades has also been analyzed. The correlation analysis indicated which domains have been developed with similar dynamics. This review should serve as a guidebook for further analysis of the domain of concepts related to Decision Support System, but also to all individuals interested in gaining the complete insight into a wider area related to Decision Support Systems, including students, managers and others.

Recognizing Human Actions in Basketball Video Sequences on the Basis of Global and Local Pairwise Representation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIMEDIA DATA ENGINEERING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Action recognition; Keypoint trajectory; Spatio-temporal features; Sports-video analysis; VLAD	RECOGNITION	A feature-representation method for recognizing actions in sports videos on the basis of the relationship between human actions and camera motions is proposed. The method involves the following steps: First, keypoint trajectories are extracted as motion features in spatio-temporal sub-regions called "spatio-temporal multiscale bags" (STMBs). Global representations and local representations from one sub-region in the STMBs are then combined to create a "glocal pairwise representation" (GPR). The GPR considers the co-occurrence of camera motions and human actions. Finally, two-stage SVM classifiers are trained with STMB-based GPRs, and specified human actions in video sequences are identified. An experimental evaluation of the recognition accuracy of the proposed method (by using the public OSUPEL basketball video dataset and broadcast videos) demonstrated that the method can robustly detect specific human actions in both public and broadcast basketball video sequences.

J	Adamczyk, M				Adamczyk, Magdalena			Interactional Aspects of Language-based Humour in Shakespeare's Comedies: The Dynamics of Punning by Ladies-in-Waiting	ATLANTIS-JOURNAL OF THE SPANISH ASSOCIATION OF ANGLO-AMERICAN STUDIES			English	Article						pun; wordplay; Shakespeare's comedy; strategic punning; interaction; context		What makes Shakespeare a man of his time is, among other things, his infatuation with punning, understood as playful fiddling with (identical/similar) forms and (distinct) meanings of words. While heavy use of puns in his plays is very much in keeping with the spirit of the day, the phenomenon enjoying a remarkably high status in Elizabethan low-and highbrow literature and culture, Shakespeare's brand of linguistic humour is surely one of a kind. The present study focuses on the dynamics of punning practiced by ladies-in-waiting in three Shakespearean comedies, i.e., Lucetta in The Two Gentlemen of Verona, Maria in Twelfth Night and Margaret in Much Ado About Nothing, and is designed to afford insight into intricate context-sensitive punning processes. It leads to the conclusion that even though the characters examined do not come into the category of highly prolific punsters, their playing with words is fully conscious and carefully tailored to individual contextual settings, principally to the type of interacting parties. Accordingly, rather than for ornamental purposes, punning proves to be used calculatedly as a powerful discourse management strategy aimed at asserting interactive dominance in order to mock the pretentiousness of interlocutors.

J	Besli, E; Oner, MA				Besli, Emre; Oner, M. Atilla			An Exploratory Study on the Development and Application of Integrated Information Technology Management Model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Information technology governance; information technology management; integrated management; internal control; information technology audit		The purpose of this study is to explore how Turkish companies are implementing information technology (IT) governance to achieve desirable behavior in the use of IT. A literature-based integrated IT management model (IITMM) is developed. Research objectives further include a high-level assessment of organizations' perceived level of IT governance capabilities by applying the proposed IITMM. The IITMM discusses the IT governance literature in three management levels (i.e. normative, strategic and operational) and in three management dimensions (i.e. goals, structures and behaviors). The model was applied to five companies from Turkish automotive supply industry. Based on the IITMM, a questionnaire was developed to provide a structured interview pattern for face-to-face interviews. An interview with a business or IT executive was conducted in each company. Results of the study revealed that except strategic goals and operational goals, different IT governance capability patterns exist for each company. Although the strategic goals and operational goals of IT governance are well understood by all participating companies, there is a room for improvement in structures and behaviors dimensions, especially in normative behaviors and strategic behaviors, as well as in strategic structures and operational structures. In addition, specific IT governance constructs are identified as drivers or inhibitors of effective IT governance implementation. Finally, some IT governance mechanisms, such as IT control framework, independent assurance, IT project management, committees and councils, IT principles and end-user involvement in determining IT strategies, were perceived as not effectively implemented. In summary, the results indicate that the IITMM provides a useful framework for determining the current IT governance capabilities of companies considering model's ability to recognize different levels of capabilities and to identify general and specific improvement opportunities.

J	Campagna, M; Di Cesare, EA				Campagna, Michele; Di Cesare, Elisabetta Anna			GEODESIGN FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE: IN THE SEARCH FOR GEODESIGN PRINCIPLES IN ITALIAN PLANNING REGULATIONS	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Geodesign; urban and regional planning regulations; Strategic Environmental Assessment		Geodesign is a trans-disciplinary concept emerging in a growing debate among scholars in North America, Europe and Asia with the aim of bridging the gap between landscape architecture, spatial planning and design, and Geographic Information Science. The concept entails the application of methods and techniques for planning sustainable development in an integrated process, from project conceptualization to analysis, simulation and evaluation, from scenario design to impact assessment, in a process including stakeholder participation and collaboration in decision-making strongly relaying on the use of digital information technologies. As such, the concept may be not entirely new. However, it is argued here, its application have not reached expected results so far. Hence, more research is needed in order to better understand methodological, technical, organizational, professional and institutional issues for a fruitful application of Geodesign principles and method in the practices. In line with the above assumptions, this paper is aimed at supplying early critical insights as a contribution towards a clearer understanding of the relationships between Geodesign concepts and planning regulations. The auspice with this first endeavour along this research issue is to make a more explicit and robust link between policy principles and planning, design and decision-making methods and tools, possibly as a small contribution to bring innovation in the planning education, governance and practice.

J	Campagna, M				Campagna, Michele			GEODESIGN FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE: FROM METAPLANNING TO 2ND GENERATION OF PLANNING SUPPORT SYSTEMS	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Geodesign; Metaplanning; Planning Support Systems; Strategic Environmental Assessment; Urban and Regional Planning		This paper deals with the concept of Geodesign, a new approach to spatial planning and design which is grounded on extensive use of Geographic Information Science methods and tools. As a method Geodesign is intended to inform projects since their conceptualization, to analysis and diagnosis, to design of alternatives and impact simulation, and eventually the final choice. This approach appears particularly urgent and actual to many scholars from academia and practitioners from the industry and the planning practice for advances in GIScience nowadays offer unprecedented data and tools to manage territorial knowledge for decision-making support. The author argues research in Geodesign may contribute to solve major actual pitfalls in sustainable spatial planning: namely it may offer methods to help planners to inform sustainable design alternatives with environmental considerations and contextually assess their impacts; secondly, it may help to ensure more transparent, responsible, and accountable democratic decision-making processes. The argumentation is supported by the author recent research results with regards to the evolution from 1st generation Planning Support Systems (PSS), to metaplanning and 2nd generation PSS.

Aging infrastructure. Increasing congestion. These urgent issues prompted the United States Congress to authorize the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2) in 2009 to conduct research for the development of products to address them. Administered by the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies under a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), SHRP2 has focused on four research areas: Safety, Renewal, Reliability, and Capacity. The goal of SHRP2 is to develop recommended procedures, practices, and applications to advance our nation's highway system in these focus areas through targeted, short-term, results-oriented research. Currently funded through March 2015, the SHRP2 program is in the final stages of research and development work, with the unveiling of products that could be adopted as standards, guides, or recommended practices at the local, state, or federal level. Current efforts are now focusing on implementation, with FHWA and AASHTO working in partnership to bring the most promising products to wide-scale deployment.

J	Ghanavati, M				Ghanavati, Mehdi			The Effect of Corporate Culture and Market Orientation on Iranian Industrial SMEs' Performance	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Corporate culture; Customer performance; Financial performance; Iranian SMEs; Market orientation	ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION; STRATEGIC ORIENTATION; CUSTOMER ORIENTATION; INNOVATIVENESS; MANAGEMENT; CAPABILITY; BUSINESS; FIRMS; SIZE	The purpose of this paper is to analyze the simultaneous effect of Corporate Culture and market orientation on the performance of small to medium-sized industrial manufacturing firms. To this end, a cross-sectional survey and variance based structural equation modeling was used for testing the hypotheses. The samples were selected based on a stratified sampling of commodity and specialty industries and consisted of 392 executives and marketing managers of Iranian industrial SMEs. The results show that the classical route among corporate culture-market orientation-customer performance-financial performance was significant and positive. The direct impact of market orientation and Corporate Culture on financial performance was not confirmed. The value of the paper is to provide unique knowledge about the effect of Corporate Culture and market orientation in small to medium-sized businesses against other larger organizations.

J	Rodriguez, A; Ramirez, C; Rodriguez, L				Rodriguez, Ariel; Ramirez, Carmela; Rodriguez, Lourdes			The City of Phoenix Latino Institute: Bridging the Gap between Community Needs and Services	JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						municipal recreation; program; management; Latino; case study		When providing services to individuals of Latin American descent living in the U.S., municipal park and recreation agencies are faced with three overarching issues: the population continues to grow at a dramatic rate, has differing values and cultures based on their heritage and levels of acculturation, and has different life contexts that influence their needs. Taken together, these various issues suggest a more comprehensive programmatic effort is needed to effectively service this population. Within the City of Phoenix, the Latino Institute was introduced in 2000 in the Parks and Recreation Department as a freestanding program to help address the aforementioned issues and to bridge the gap between the City and the Latino community. Today, the Latino Institute produces numerous programs for the community and serves as an outreach specialist that provides special events, networking, and cultural competency expertise to the City and agencies which aim to provide services to the Latino community. Over the past 13 years, the Latino Institute has gained a number of insights that have helped their program to succeed where others have not. First, the importance of partnerships was stressed. Partners help not only through their financial resources, but also through the volunteers they may provide and the added social network value they produce. During the most difficult financial times at die City of Phoenix, these partners provided the support the Latino Institute needed to survive the most recent economic recession. Second, understanding the community with all its diversity was critical. This helped to ensure that different needs were represented in the programs the Latino Institute implemented. Third, continuously reaching out to the Latino community, maintaining a high level of service, and being reliable and transparent, helped the Latino Institute to maintain a high level of trust in the eves of both the community and the City. This high level of trust has also played an important role in maintaining a positive level of political support. Lastly, given the small number of staff the Latino Institute maintains and the many initiatives it pursues, having a strategic plan that is monitored by an engaged executive board has helped to focus Latino Institute efforts and maximize its limited resources.

J	Sibilla, M				Sibilla, Maurizio			VIRTUAL POWER PLANT ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT TOOLS OF THE SETTLEMENT PROCESSES	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Distributed Energy Resource; Energy Planning; Urban Renewable Processes; Urban Metabolism		The Distributed Energy Resource (DER) systems represent a possible option for the implementation of the Low Carbon Cities development scenario, consistently with EU orientations. Many surveys, especially of engineering and information technology origin, are contributing to DER systems spread through testing the Virtual Power Plan (VVP): a technological system aimed at synchronously managing the information and energy fluxes, and able to have an effect on the urban metabolism balance and on the energy chain organizational model. In the event of a wider VVP spread, consequences for the urban structure social and technical conversion process might be envisioned. Such systems gain importance in terms of starting urban renewal processes, introducing new rules for the local energy and environmental infrastructures. In this way, it is envisioned the need for a deeper comprehension of the VVP innovative functionalities, this comprehension being significant for all the branches of knowledge which are interested in developing methods and tools for the Environmental Technology Management and Planning of the settlement processes. The author, who is interested in producing and organizing an energy, distributed, renewable and interactive model, shows, through a critical analysis of the Electricity Networks Europe program study cases, the operating potential of the new system, emphasizing the consequences on the settlement process development, thus providing a first definition of the strategic features for the VVP technical and social implementation.

Ethical Decision-making in Extreme Operating Environments: Kew Garden Principles and Strategic CSR in Three Service Industry Cases	BUSINESS & PROFESSIONAL ETHICS JOURNAL			English	Article						Kew Garden Principles; ethical decision-making; strategic corporate social responsibility; crisis management	CRISIS; ORGANIZATIONS; RESPONSIBILITY; CORPORATIONS; OBLIGATIONS; RESCUE	The business landscape today is characterized by looming global challenges like natural disasters, war, and industrial accidents throughout the world. However, there is limited research on describing how businesses operate and cope in extreme environments and whether principles of ethical decision-making can be used as guidelines in such situations. To address this gap we describe and analyze organizational and business responses to three different extreme environments, namely the fall 2012 Gaza conflict, Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, and the so-called triple disasters (earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown) in Japan on March 11, 2011. We discuss moral issues surrounding helping one another with specific reference to criteria called the Kew Garden Principles (KGPs) and strategic corporate social responsibility (Strategic CSR). We conclude the paper with managerial and leadership implications for ethical decision-making in extreme situations.

J	Viltard, LA				Viltard, Leandro A.			ARE CORPORATE UNIVERSITIES (CU) POSSIBLE IN EMERGING COUNTRIES? A SURVEY CONDUCTED IN ARGENTINA SHOWED IMPACTING RESULTS	INDEPENDENT JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & PRODUCTION			English	Article						Corporate University; Corporate education and training; Emerging countries; Developing countries; Argentina; Corporate University Implementation		At the time of our investigation, the CU was not a widespread concept in Argentina, being viewed as a "foreign - far long project" (coming from developed countries and standing for the long term). It is suggested that the rate of CU evolution, in emerging countries like Argentina, is more related to mentality issues than to CU strategic or operative limitations. Although the executives who replied to a survey were not the only power factor in their organization, their comments allow us to think that, in those countries, the CU may have a better future perspective. The research used a quali-quantitative methodology, which was based on a survey to top executives of different kinds of companies located in Argentina. The research design was not experimental and transversal, as it was limited to a specific moment in time.

J	Zhu, QT; Wu, XW; Sun, LX				Zhu, Quan-tao; Wu, Xin-wang; Sun, Laixiang			A generalized framework for endogenous timing in duopoly games and an application to price-quantity competition	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS			English	Article						Duopoly games; Endogenous timing; Basic competition forms; Price-quantity competition	HOMOGENEOUS PRODUCT MARKET; LEADERSHIP; BERTRAND; ADVANCE; ORDER	This paper extends the analysis of duopoly market by distinguishing two types of competition: (i) the basic form of competition where each firm is unrestricted in its choice of price and quantity and (ii) the non-basic form of competition where firms' strategic choices over price and quantity are limited a priori. Our analysis focuses on the former rather than the latter. Under a very general setting of concave industrial revenue and asymmetric convex costs, we show that each firm typically makes more profit in the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) of the leader-follower price-quantity competition, one of the basic competition forms, than in the SPNE of the leader-follower price competition and that each firm always makes more profit under simultaneous move price-quantity competition than under simultaneous move price competition. We establish a generalized framework for endogenous timing in duopoly games which is capable of embodying and overcoming the inconsistency across the existing three frameworks in the field. We highlight the advantages of a 3-period general framework.

This paper focuses on the strategic level, more specifically the sequential exploration of the possible options and the final selection (recommendation) of the best option. Several sequential exploration and recommendation criteria are considered and empirically compared on real world problems (board games, card games and energy management problems) in the uniform (1-player) and adversarial (2-player) settings W.r.t the sequential exploration part, the classical upper confidence bound algorithm, the exponential exploration-exploitation algorithm, the successive reject algorithm (designed specifically for simple regret), and the Bernstein races, are considered. W.r.t. the recommendation part, the selection is based on the empirically best arm, most played arm, lower confidence bounds, based on the reward distribution or variants thereof designed for risk control. This paper presents a systematic study, comparing the coupling of the sequential exploration and recommendation variants on the considered problems in terms of their simple regret. A secondary contribution is that, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first win ever of a computer-kill-all Go player against professional human players [16].

It considers studies on how organizations invest on acquiring these resources to achieve superior outcomes and the elements which constitute this ability. The case studied demonstrated the importance of establishing a dedicated function; the creation of tools and routines; procedures for selecting partners and consideration of the interfaces between structure and corporate systems and those adopted by the networks. It advances on the empirical literature of alliances capabilities and proves the contribution of experience and learning mechanisms interposed between experiences and learning performance. However, it highlights that these are necessaria sed non sufficiens elements to reach expected results.

TECHNOLOGY-CONVERSANT MANAGEMENT EDUCATION: INTRODUCING A NEW DISCIPLINE	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								In the first quarter of 2013, the Department of Industrial Engineering at the University of Stellenbosch launched a new academic course, Strategic Technology Analysis (STA), as an elective in its M.Sc. in Engineering Management and M.Eng. Industrial Engineering degrees. STA views technology as a knowledge area in its own right, focuses on the inherent characteristics of technology, and explores its natural order. The purpose was to ascertain whether a course of this nature, which offered the outline for a new academic discipline, would be of benefit to a technology-conversant management programme. The course was well-received. It encouraged a greater awareness of technological positioning - i.e., aligning overall corporate strategy with new opportunities across the entire technological frontier. This article describes the background to this initiative, the history of STA, its inherent structure, and its role in professional practice. It then looks ahead at the possible dissemination of this knowledge into different settings where technology-conversant management is taught.	[van Wyk, R.

THE INSTITUTIONAL ASPECT OF REALIZATION OF THE REGIONAL INNOVATIVE SYSTEMS OPENNESS PRINCIPLE (BY EXAMPLE OF AIRR-REGIONS)	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						open innovations; innovative policy; Association of Innovative Regions of Russia; international and interregional relations		Due to the transition of Russia to an innovative way of development need of research of realization of innovative process at various levels of economy is staticized. As the world practice of management of development of innovative systems of various level testifies, transformation of models of innovative process happens in the direction of openness. In models of the last generations paramount value is gained by strategic integration as for successful innovative activity interaction only between enterprise divisions is not enough, other sources of knowledge are necessary: universities, research centers, consumers. Thus, there is a gradual change of a paradigm of innovative development from the closed innovative practice to its new, open forms. Data of the researches confirming show that in Russia the absolute majority of innovations is developed in the companies, practically without attraction of intellectual and financial resources from the outside. With such a closed approach the company does not use external sources for creation of innovations, counts only on itself and seeks to protect innovations by the rights to intellectual property. Open innovative practice assumes active search of perspective ideas in the environment, joint researches and creation of innovations with other partners, and also strategic use of the rights to intellectual property. The main condition of transition to the model of open innovations is the corresponding institutional environment, in particular, reflection of the concept of openness in basic laws of regions in the sphere of innovative activity, normative legal acts in the sphere of intellectual property protection, interregional agreements, documents of strategic planning and program goals management, etc. The conclusion that today the given institutional base is quite poorly developed at the level of regions is drawn. In the conditions of activization of integration processes in the economic sphere the problem of harmonization of the legislation is of particular importance. One of the major limiting factors of constructive interaction of regions and formation of a uniform innovative space of the country is inconsistency and different levels of development of the institutional environment in regions. In the article the results of the analysis of the basic regional legislation are given in the sphere of innovative activity about compliance of open innovations model realization, institutional barriers on the way of interregional interaction come to light and recommendations on improvement of the relevant provisions of regional laws in the sphere of innovative activity in the transition context to open innovative systems are offered.

Evaluations provide the evidence necessary to build the science. The deconstructed processes from assessments through implementation and conclusion of the interventions have been outlined and can now be evaluated so as to define critical points of success and/or failure within the respective processes. Interventions should be examined for their effectiveness in achieving the objectives for which they were selected and for their contributions to attaining the goal outlined in the strategic plan. Effects of an intervention other than those for which the intervention was selected may have an additive benefit or they may have a negative impact on the affected society. Resource consumption (costs) is an important element of evaluations. Health disaster management evaluations aim at quality improvement for future interventions (preparedness). However, evaluation based on participating and/or concomitant observation also may open for improvement of ongoing interventions.

In this paper, we describe an integrated technology planning approach with the focus on the use of technology roadmapping concept in a systematic process, using dedicated and customized software which utilizes integer linear programming (ILP) tools, to aid decision-makers in selecting the optimum portfolio of R&D projects in the manufacturing processes of large, high-technology companies. The optimum portfolio is based on the projects' contribution toward company's business and market requirements employing Strategic Technology Alignment Roadmapping (STAR) process, which is being developed at the University of Nottingham. The STAR methodology and the software tool have been tested in industrial scenarios using real data from two high-tech companies.

J	Kubota, FI; Miguel, PAC				Kubota, Flavio Issao; Cauchick Miguel, Paulo Augusto			ANALYSIS OF PUBLICATIONS ON INNOVATION IN JOURNALS OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT IN BRAZIL	REVISTA GEINTEC-GESTAO INOVACAO E TECNOLOGIAS			English	Article						Innovation; Innovation Management; Literature Review; Brazil		Innovation management is a critical activity for all companies because it supports the strategic direction, guides the resources allocation, provide sustainability to business, create new capabilities and generate new knowledge, and making enterprises more competitive. As a consequence, research and development towards innovation has becoming an important issue for companies which aims at achieving better results and competitiveness, especially in emerging markets, e.g. in Brazil. In this context, this paper analyses publications on innovation that were outlet of ten Brazilian operations management journals. It aims to understand and point out some papers' characteristics and identifies research opportunities in the subject by verifying what has been studied in the innovation context in Brazil. The paper consists of a theoretical-conceptual study to achieve a better understand regarding innovation based on a literature analysis focused in a sample of publications in Brazil. The results show that although the innovation concept was expanded, most papers still address the technological innovation perspective, especially focused on products. Another dominant aspect concerns studies that identify and analyze innovation characteristics in a particular industry, such as automotive, energy, ceramics, construction, etc. Additionally, comparative studies among sectors or companies have been developed. Thus, it can be concluded that there are opportunities for future research in other innovation perspectives, such as in processes, services, marketing and organizational processes. Other research gaps and perspectives in this bibliographic sample are also discussed.

J	LeRouge, CM; Tulu, B; Wood, S				LeRouge, Cynthia M.; Tulu, Bengisu; Wood, Suzanne			Project Initiation for Telemedicine Services	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND INFORMATICS			English	Article						Collaborative Technology; Project Initiation; Project Management; Qualitative Research; Telemedicine; Telestroke		This study investigates project initiation for telemedicine, a technology innovation in healthcare organizations that manifests both intra- and inter-organizational collaboration. Moving from a telemedicine project to a sustainable telemedicine service line can be a challenge for many organizations (LeRouge, Tulu, & Forducey, 2010). Project definition (a.k.a., initiation) sets the strategic vision for a project and has been categorized as the most important stage in a project (C. Gray & Larson, 2008) and a key element for project success (Stah-Le Cardinal & Marle, 2006). Although project management best practices have been applied in many domains, there are few studies that link published best practices to the telemedicine domain. This study first presents a model, resulting from a review of project management literature that specifies the recommended components project definition. Using this model as a foundation, the authors explore how project definition is deployed in the telemedicine domain, using the instantiation of telestroke projects for this study. The authors base their findings on a multi-case qualitative data set, with each case representing a distinct telemedicine business model. Findings from this study explicate how the telestroke project initiation process is collaboratively managed and how this process impacts the overall success of the telemedicine programs through the lens of the five distinct telemedicine business models. Specifically, this study contributes insights on key elements of project initiation in the telemedicine context as well as the effects of the varying business models (focusing on commonalities and differences).

Shot Peening Induced Plastic Deformation in Cast Iron - Influence of Graphite Morphology	HTM-JOURNAL OF HEAT TREATMENT AND MATERIALS			English	Article						Shot peening; cast iron; graphite morphology; EBSD; residual stress		Graphite morphology in cast iron strongly affects the mechanical properties such as: Young's modulus, tensile/compressive strength and cyclic mechanical behaviour. In this study, pearlitic compact graphite iron (CGI) and grey cast iron (GI) have been studied in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) before and after shot peening under different conditions. The plastic deformation behaviour of CGI and GI under different shot peening conditions has been analysed using electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) and electron contrast channelling imaging (ECCI). EBSD and ECCI revealed that plastic deformation around graphite inclusions depends on the size and shape of the graphite. The different response of CGI and GI to shot peening is explained by the different damping properties of the graphite and the matrix capability for plastic deformation.	[Lundberg, M.; Peng, R.

J	Hertwig, M				Hertwig, Markus			Technology facades in high-tech companies? Decoupling in the implementation of e-business technology in the German automotive supply industry	BERLINER JOURNAL FUR SOZIOLOGIE			German	Article						Decoupling; New institutionalism; Internet technology; Automotive supply industry	SYMBOLIC MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONS; GOVERNANCE; RESPONSES	In the beginning of the internet age, companies were confronted with sometimes contradictory expectations regarding the use of e-business technologies. Using the concept of decoupling from new institutionalistic organization theory, the article examines under what conditions companies chose a decoupling strategy. In this way, the study aims to expand the empirical knowledge about decoupling processes and contribute to the new institutionalist theory debate on forms and conditions of strategic responses to institutional requirements. On the basis of data collected in 2002, influences on decoupling are analyzed by means of multivariate methods. The findings show that the choice of a decoupling strategy is influenced by external and internal factors as well as by the characteristics of the institutionalized model itself.

CONTROL OF COMMUNICATION-REPUTATION FIELD ORGANIZATION	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE			Russian	Article						strategic management; communication audit; reputational audit; communication and reputational field of organization		In recent years, more and more companies are turning their attention towards strategic management. This is primarily due to the fact that the situation is constantly changing in terms of factors of macro-and micro-environment of the company, and the management structure, based on strategic management is much easier and more efficient in aligning with new or changed circumstances. One way to manage the macro factors that influence organization development, is a holistic approach to communications and reputation field of the organization. In order to understand the specifics of communication and reputation field, it is necessary to consider its basic components. Communication field of organization is a multi-level, complex system of elements connected and ready to dynamic changes depending on the macro (or other) requirements of environmental stimulus. Communication field of organization is studied using communication audit, which involves a complete and systematic study of the organization communicative behavior, in order to identify the mechanisms of forming and the quality of communication links. Reputational field of organization - a kind of quilt, created on the basis of individual reputation elements or united disparate reputational factors, broadcasting different audiences and perceived them as part of the reputation of the organization questioned. One of study methods of it is reputational audit, involving assessment organization's reputation in terms of its objectives and strategies. After analyzing the basic components of communication and reputation field of the organization, we should note the integrated, interdisciplinary and multiparadigm nature of this concept, the basic functionality of which is broadcasting reputational factors via different communication channels, aimed at the target audiences. Communications and reputation management field of organization should be based on systematic monitoring of the communication organization field and identification of the dominant reputational factors, with the possibility of adjusting the basis of the overall organization strategy.

FORMATION OF FUNCTIONAL COMPETENCES OF THE STUDENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY	SIBIRSKIY PSIKHOLOGICHESKIY ZHURNAL-SIBERIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			Russian	Article						practical management; personnel management; competence; functional card; a personal development plan		The article is devoted to analysis of the experience of professional support for students on a speciality "Management of the personnel". The article presents such creations as the functional map of competencies, work with individual plans for students, shows the universal technology of the formation of functional competencies for future professionals. The competence approach in education implies that the result of mastering the basic educational program in a higher educational institution should be to some extent formed competence, understood as the ability to use knowledge, skills and personal qualities in accordance with the tasks of professional activity. Under the functional competences there are meant here the knowledge, skills and abilities that are necessary for performing the functions of the professional activity. At the end of the 90-ies of the 20 century, there is a strategic understanding of the functions of the HR Manager and each of the functions carried out by the HR employee in the organization, such as search, selection, motivation, staff training etc, is closely connected as with other functions, and in General with organizational strategy. Of course, this requires a careful approach to the formation of professional competence of future HR specialist. The article considers in detail the direction of work with students in the framework of the author of the course "Practical management". These areas include the following: reconstruction own experience (positive and negative) through the reflection of action, situations (past); work with the goals, goal setting skills (future) and the analysis and reflection of today's actions (what's being done now). Important framework of the course is considering factors such as the competitiveness of the graduates in the labor market, qualification, competence; capitalization, which influence the formation of functional (professional) competences of students. Exam-practice management involves the analysis of what actions implemented students in various areas of theirs life, why and how they worked in these four areas (competitiveness, qualification, competence, capitalization). It turns out that a job in line with these trends solves two tasks: tasks of their own professional and personal development, and acquisition simultaneously those tools and technologies that are currently in demand in HR management in modern organizations (and coaching, and mentoring-technology professional hosting, profiles of competencies, functional card, a personal development plan). Tools for supporting and development of professional competences of students become tools of their professional activity-it seems that this is the uniqueness of the suggested ways of professional support.

As a representative client cache system, the performance of Cache Files is limited by transition faults. Furthermore, Cache Files just supports a simple LRU policy with a tightly-coupled design. To overcome these limitations, we propose to employ Stable Set Model (SSM) to improve Cache Files and design an enhanced Cache Files, SAC. SSM assumes that data access can be decomposed to access on some stable sets, in which elements are always repeatedly accessed or not accessed together. Using SSM methods can improve the cache management and reduce the effect of transition faults. We also adopt loosely-coupled methods to design prefetch and replacement policies. We implement our scheme on Linux 2.6.32 and measure the execution time of the scheme with various file I/O benchmarks. Experiments show that SAC can significantly improve I/0 performance and reduce execution time up to 84%, compared with the existing Cache Files.

J	Mani, A				Mani, Alice			Evolving corporate sustainable development: a case study of Mysore Paper Mills Limited	ASIAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article						Social equity; Human needs; Sustainability		In 1987, the World Commission on Economic Development (WCED) popularized the term "sustainable development" in its well-cited report, Our Common Future. According to this report, sustainable development is defined as "the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." The WCED asserted that sustainable development required simultaneous adoption of environmental, economical, and equity principles. Bansal (Strategic Management Journal, 26(3), 197-218, 2005) has conducted a study of Canadian firms in the oil and gas, mining, and forestry industries from 1986 to 1995. The study found that both resources based and institutional factors influence corporate sustainable development. This paper studied the corporate sustainable development of Mysore Paper Mills Ltd. from 1995 to 2011 using the same model. The study found that independent variables with significant impact on environmental integrity and overall sustainability were fines, penalties, court cases (total) involved by the company, and log of total assets. On economic prosperity, the independent variable with significant impact is log of total assets. For social equity, the independent variable with significant impact is foreign sales as percentage of total sales, number of fines/penalties/court cases (total), number of fines/penalties/court cases (environmental), log(total assets), and return on equity.

Existing methods to maintain metadata consistency generally need several log forced write operations. Since synchronous disk IO is very inefficient, the average response time of metadata operations is greatly increased. In this paper, an asynchronous atomic commit protocol (ACP) named Dual-Log (DL) is presented. It does not need any log forced write operations. Optimizing for distributed metadata operations involving only two metadata servers, DL mutually records the redo log in counterpart metadata servers by transferring through the low latency network. A crashed metadata server can redo the metadata operation with the redundant redo log. Since the latency of the network is much lower than the latency of disk TO, DL can improve the performance of distributed metadata service significantly. The prototype of DL is implemented based on local journal. The performance is tested by comparing with two widely used protocols, EP and S2PC-MP, and the results show that the average response time of distributed metadata operations is reduced by about 40%-60%, and the recovery time is only 1 second under 10 thousands uncompleted distributed metadata operations.

Research Synergy: The Graduate School of Public Health, the SDSU Research Foundation, and San Diego State University	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						research university; strategic plan; research management		The evolution of a research university can take many paths. Described here is a case study of the synergy between the establishment and growth of a primarily graduate school and the commitment to developing a research university, all with the assistance of a separately incorporated non-profit research administration entity. The result has been a dramatic advancement of the university as a nationally recognized research institution, benefiting from an emerging field and school focused on applied research and community engagement, and a research support entity that has likewise thrived in its mission. The strategies leading to this success highlight the role of research in institutional advancement and regional recognition, even when operating in the context of a primarily teaching oriented state educational system; the support of a strong research management apparatus was key to producing successful results.

The former can be identified as a narrow banking framework while the latter can be identified as a synergy banking framework. In addition, we also introduce a Black-Merton-type structural model in a non-exclusive, narrow synergy framework. We compare the three structural models for their default prediction capabilities under capital regulation. We find a consistent result from these three models: higher capital requirements lead to lower default risks in the bank's equity return. The ranking of the significance effect on default risk is sorted in the following order: Merton type, Black-Merton-type and Black-type one. This analysis provides important strategic and policy implications for bank managers and regulators.

As a consequence, managerial practice and methods significantly changed in the last decade of the 20th century and those changes have been continuing in the 21st century. In that context, contemporary trends present in the managerial accounting are associated with its strategic concepts, such as: activity based costing system, just-in-time system and total quality management. Starting from the a.m., the main objective of this research will be directed towards providing data for that if Macedonian business entities are familiar with these concepts and how much they implement them. For this purposewe carried out a survey on a representative sample of Macedonian companies. The examination conducted in this paper shows that business entities in R. Macedonia still apply these accounting techniques not sufficiently. Obtained results are presented within this paper in details.

This domain is agro-forestry management, which uses and produces a large amount of spatial data to be analyzed. This data has a specific and complex nature since it can be in the form of texts, numbers, vectors or images. This tool can be developed for interactive and rapid analysis; for example introduce spatial data type in data layer, display spatial data in human readable manner,. etc. so that the results of the analyses are the basis of strategic business decisions in the world of agro-forestry management. So, Remote-sensing data structure which concern different domains (climatic, hydraulic, geologic... etc) necessitates a good management of data warehouse, to be exploitable for analyze, visualization and integration in a management and decision support in the agroforestry sector. Data collected in a study of different tasks of this domain, is used for the conception of different database models, to implement its internal structure in the 'RACLE' Database Manager System (DBMS). Furthermore, different data layers are prepared by MapInfo Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software, in order to be imported by the use of MapInfo MapX library, in the prototype interface built by Delphi.

The case study incorporates competition, and views sourcing strategies as a means to improve the firm's viability to survive competition in the marketplace. The study begins by positioning the Red Queen theory within the sourcing literature. It subsequently applies the framework to a case study of SAP AG to illustrate how sourcing strategies have changed over time in response to the logic of competition. The case study reveals that (a) organizations are adaptive systems and capable of learning to make strategic changes pertaining to sourcing arrangements; (b) organizations select the terms on which they want to compete by developing certain capabilities within the firm; (c) organizations are reflexive and over time develop competitive hysteresis which allows them to become stronger competitors. In the case of SAP AG, various sourcing arrangements were selected over its 40-year history to respond to technological and market changes.

J	Aydogan, G; Koksal, A				Aydogan, Guzin; Koksal, Almula			Host-Country Related Risk Factors in International Construction: Meta-Analysis	MEGARON			English	Article						International construction risks; meta-analysis; country risk; risk assessment models		Internationalization has been on the agenda of construction firms as a strategic option in global competition. Due to globalization every sector including the construction industry has faced with high levels of competitiveness, uncertainty, and risk. International construction involves common risks to domestic construction, as well as risks that are related to the host country. These risks have serious effects on the performance of international projects. Since the sustainable competitiveness of international contractors depends largely on the effective management of these risks, their assessment becomes vital for the success of international contractors. The main aim of this study is to analyse the risks for international construction projects that are related to the host country. Meta-analysis technique is used in order to determine these risks. This paper, therefore, reviews the literature that has been published in four most respected construction and management journals, these being; Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, Journal of Management in Engineering, Construction Management and Economics, and International Journal of Project Management for the period of 2000-2010. International construction risk assessment models are also reviewed within the context of this study, since host country related risk factors were found to have serious effects on the profitability of international contractors due to literature review. As a result; political stability, law and regulations, exchange rate risk, cultural differences, inflation, expropriation, tax discrimination, language barrier, bribery and corruption, force majeure, and societal conflicts in the host country are found to be the most important risk factors in international construction. Findings of this study can be used in risk assessment models for international construction projects.

J	Baidya, M; Ghosh, G				Baidya, Mehir; Ghosh, Gautam			An empirical investigation of repeat buying behavior of customers of two brands in India	JOURNAL OF INDIAN BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Quality; Probability; Logistic regression; Price	PRICE-QUALITY RELATIONSHIP; CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS; SERVICE QUALITY; SATISFACTION; MODEL; PROFITABILITY; CONSEQUENCES; METHODOLOGY; INFORMATION; INTENTIONS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to attempt to test whether price and quality have any influence on customer repeat purchase probability. Managers should know the strategic determinants of repeat purchase probability to retain customers. Design/methodology/approach - Primary data were gathered on repeat purchase, price and quality via a survey of 400 customers of two brands in the Business-to-customer (B2C) sector. Then 380 x 4 data points to a logit model were fitted to estimate the effects of price and quality on customer repeat purchase probability. Findings - It was found that price, quality and price x quality influence customer repeat purchase probability substantially. Furthermore, the elasticities of repeat purchase probability to price and quality are quite high in both cases. Practical implications - Managers should use elasticities to determine how to allocate funds between price and quality to maximize repeat purchase probability. Originality/value - In view of the complexity of customer repeat buying behavior, this study deals with one aspect or feature of the total process, which does not mean that it has no value. By confirming two strategic determinants of customer repeat purchase probability and suggesting a simple rule of fund allocation, this work definitely adds some research of value to the relevant marketing literature.

The aim of the presented work was to develop a novel method of gadolinium zirconate synthesis by using a reactive sintering procedure under high pressure based on commercial ZrO2 and Gd2O3 nanopowders. Samples were analyzed using X-ray diffraction and SEM to check their phase composition and microstructure. The obtained sintered pellets demonstrated peaks characteristic for pyrochlore structure for a wide range of preparation temperatures and high density (99.5 % of the theoretical value). It was found that the resulting materials exhibited a homogeneous microstructure and the average grain size dependent on sintering temperature.

In particular, the authors focus on a multi-business multinational firm in which different administrative systems were experimented simultaneously as a way to determine which of these systems provided the most conducive context for innovation and capability development. Design/methodology/approach - The authors adopted an inductive perspective and developed a single case research project aimed at documenting the process of experimentation and subsequent selection and adoption of a new administrative system by a large multi-business multinational firm. Findings - The paper's main contribution is the concept of "induced variation", understood as intra-organizational variation-increasing mechanisms deliberately created at the top level of the organization to trigger an intra-organizational evolutionary process of management innovation. This finding extends and modifies Burgelman's discussion of induced and autonomous strategic behavior by showing that induced processes need not necessarily be variation-reducing, but may actually be variation-increasing. Additionally, the authors explain how an evolutionary process aimed at learning about the relative merits of alternative administrative systems through in vivo "reflection in action" (Schon, 1983) unfolds in a complex global organization. Research limitations/implications - While the work provides several insights on the development of an evolutionary process leading to management innovation, its inductive nature limits its external validity and requires the development of further work for such purpose. Practical implications - The authors explore the roles of regional organizations in creating new corporate capabilities for the MNC. Social implications-The authors show how management capabilities developed in the Latin American context were rolled out to other locations. Originality/value - The authors' findings confirm that major drastic reorganization initiatives can actually be approached using an evolutionary approach.

J	Chong, PS; Chen, M; Su, XM				Chong, Philip; Chen, Ming; Su, Xuemei			Comparative study of behavioral mindsets in team decision	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Resource allocation; Behavioural mindset; Team decision		Purpose - Resource allocation is an important area of strategic planning in any organization, including higher education. In comparing two case examples of a college's efforts in shared governance in allocating budget to its five departments, the purpose of this paper is to show the importance of a college's awareness and understanding of team behavioral mindsets and contextual factors when practicing continuous improvement each time it applies shared governance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors propose five models that represent five distinct behavioral mindsets. The authors examine the fit of real data based on two case examples, and then identify and compare the behavioral mindsets and possible coalition formed in each case. Findings - The results show the type of behavioral mindset evolves over time, and the contextual factors such as changes in the macro-environment, the composition of decision makers, and their personalities, play an important role in shaping the final outcome. Continuously monitoring and learning, which leads to a more thorough understanding and awareness of the changes in contextual factors, is imperative. Originality/value - Team decision making involving resource allocation is a critical problem in higher education when applying shared governance. A clear understanding of the type of behavioral mindset exhibited in the process and its causes is critical. The paper proposes a model that can help higher education administrators identify the behavioral mindset. In addition, the authors find support from established theories for the evolution of team behavioral mindsets in a college's budget allocation.

J	Choudhury, MA				Choudhury, Masudul Alam			Is global financial and social stability possible?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC AND MIDDLE EASTERN FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Awareness level; Calculated intangible value; Challenges and future; Economic crisis		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate on the social wellbeing aspects of human sustainability. Linked to this is the investigation on how economic stability and social wellbeing are interactively integrated together to establish the stability along with sustainability. What is the nature of the global financial architecture? Why has it defied formation? Have the underlying theory of financial economic theory, its variables and indicators, and axioms of man and society in their midst, denied the actualization of the intended institution? How can the global stability and well-being criterion be established from coordinated level of global socioeconomic consciousness? Design/methodology/approach - Ageneralized evaluation model addressing the "as is" and the "as it ought to be" scenarios is formalized. An illustrative empirical example is provided to chart such a method of empirics using the episteme of unity of knowledge and its various ramifications. Findings - Thus, there is a general perspective overarching the selection of theory, variables and their inter-causal consequences that the global financial architecture cannot answer. The institutional structure envisioned thereby is not representative of the lateral aggregation of membership in prevailing socioeconomic understanding. Instead, a complex yet unifying aggregation is carried out to receive its global acceptance? The episteme of unity of knowledge (Tawhid) in the Islamic perspective along with its methodological formalism and empirical and strategic implications for sustainable global financial stability is presented as the unique and universal alternative. Research limitations/implications - More empirical analysis can be carried out by extending the critical portfolio variables and collecting data on them as required. Practical implications - The paper evaluates the roots of human deprivation in an uncertain global order as being based on a quaint way of understanding socio-scientific reality and applying human consciousness toward its reconstruction. The paper then proposes an alternative and applied perspective of the opposite methodological worldview premised on unity of knowledge and unity of the world-system. This epistemology is referred to as Tawhid, meaning the oneness of God represented by organic unity in the order of everything. Social implications - Within the world-system, complex as it is, abide the epistemological foundations of economic, financial and social thought. Thereby, the analytical extraction derived from the episteme of unity of knowledge (Tawhid) exemplifies the ethical reconstruction and its application in rigorous ways to attain sustained global financial and social stability. Originality/value - This paper has suggested that under the prevailing paradigm of thought and its institutionalism the future of global financial stability is not sustainable as it has proved in the recent past. Yet there is a different epistemological way of rethinking the world-system in general in its interconnected dimensions and taking the specific example of the financial economy. Upon such new reconstruction, an entirely new methodological and strategic worldview can be established. This is the methodological worldview of unity of knowledge and its formalism.

J	Chrysler-Fox, PD; Roodt, G				Chrysler-Fox, Pharny D.; Roodt, Gert			Principles in selecting human capital measurements and metrics	SA JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article							QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; SATURATION; CARE	Orientation: Physical and natural resources have been surpassed by human capital as a resource of wealth creation. As a result, senior management relies increasingly on appropriate people information to drive strategic change. Yet, measurement within the human resource function predominantly informs decisions in support of efficiency and effectiveness. Consequently, dissimilar understanding of measurement expectations between these parties largely continues. Research purpose: The study explored principles in selecting human capital measurements, drawing on the views and recommendations of human resource management professionals, all experts in human capital measurement. Motivation for the study: The motivation was to advance the understanding of selecting appropriate and strategic valid measurements, in order for human resource practitioners to contribute to creating value and driving strategic change. Research design, approach and method: A qualitative approach, with purposively selected cases from a selected panel of human capital measurement experts, generated a dataset through unstructured interviews, which were analysed thematically. Main findings: Nineteen themes were found. They represent a process that considers the centrality of the business strategy and a systemic integration across multiple value chains in the organisation through business partnering, in order to select measurements and generate management level- appropriate information. Practical/managerial implications: Measurement practitioners, in partnership with management from other functions, should integrate the business strategy across multiple value chains in order to select measurements. Analytics becomes critical in discovering relationships and formulating hypotheses to understand value creation. Higher education institutions should produce graduates able to deal with systems thinking and to operate within complexity. Contribution: This study identified principles to select measurements and metrics. Noticeable is the move away from the interrelated scorecard perspectives to a systemic view of the organisation in order to understand value creation. In addition, the findings may help to position the human resource management function as a strategic asset.

J	Cramer, H; Dewulf, G; Voordijk, H				Cramer, Hendrik; Dewulf, Geert; Voordijk, Hans			The barriers to nurturing and empowering long-term care experiments - Lessons learnt to advance future healthcare projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Empowerment; Long-term care innovations; Nurturing; Project management; Strategic niche management; Subsidy		The objective of this study is to explore the barriers to nurturing and empowering subsidized long-term care experiments that try to deal with today's long-term care challenges such as an aging population and increasing healthcare costs. Nurturing is the process of planning, implementing, and learning from experiments. The empowerment process deals with stabilizing experiments into the existing long-term care system. This is a qualitative study of a network that nurtured and tried to empower three long-term care experiments, which were subsidized by a ministerial transition program (2009-2011) in the Netherlands. In total, 14 open-ended, semi-structured interviews were conducted. Further data were collected through participation, collecting documents, and pursuing a focus group. The findings revealed eight barriers to nurturing and empowering the experiments. During the planning of the experiments, top managers and consultants were (1) lacking time, (2) ignored the local context, and (3) did neither engage project managers nor professionals. At the start of the experimentation, project managers and professionals were lacking (4) motivation, (5) time, and (6) support while there was (7) no sense of urgency to experiment. Finally, there was (8) no commitment from the top managers during the empowerment of the experiments. In conclusion, future projects have to try to avoid these barriers. Otherwise, time, money, and energy are lost in overcoming these barriers, which are needed to deal with today's long-term care challenges.

The purpose of the paper is the exploration of a specific performance measurement model - the balanced scorecard strategy map - which is suitable for the particular features of an academic department. The paper uses a qualitative methodology to identify the dimensions of the performance measurement and proposes a set of goals and measures. The paper extends the customer perspective by considering a wider system of stakeholders and emphasises the strategic role of the financial dimension as a driver for achieving the mission.

This response to the paper illustrates how their conceptualization serves as a rich observational prism for understanding leadership evolution within North American healthcare organizations. Summative echoes are also observed in an international survey of leaders reported by the IBM foundation. These deductive and illustrative observations reinforce the salience of Kreiger and Zhovtobryukh model's as a timely conceptual lens for scholarly efforts seeking to explore contemporary leadership. Originality/value - Highlights how the aforementioned paper provides a conceptual lens through which to explore contemporary leadership in a scholarly context.

J	den Heyer, G				den Heyer, Garth			EXAMINING POLICE STRATEGIC RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN A TIME OF AUSTERITY	SALUS JOURNAL			English	Article						Strategy; new public management; police reform; resource allocation		The increasing importance of proactive policing has highlighted the need to ensure that the police utilise their resources both efficiently and effectively. Traditionally, police agencies have allocated resources in response to their operational demands or requirements, with the majority of resources being distributed in response to political demands and public calls for service. In recent years there has been a greater emphasis by police to deliver services proactively, and to direct resources to specific geographic areas of high crime or to specific crimes, and to apply intelligence led targeted policing initiatives. The changing operating environment to a public service ethos of accountability and 'do more with less' means that historical methods of allocating police officers may not meet an agency's strategic goals. This paper examines if an economic approach to allocating police strategic resources is an appropriate and equitable method in a time of austerity. This greater emphasis on proactive, rather than reactive policing, which also represents a shift from centralised control, underlines the need to ensure the efficient and effective use of resources.

It proposes a flexible process based on Functional Analysis and Adaptive Structuration Theory, called Virtual Entities Management Support (VEMS). Starting from environmental requirements analysis, the method helps to choose functions, attitudes, and tools based on a strategic vision in three dimensions: the virtual entity value addition, the members' satisfaction, and the entity flexible frontiers. It leverages the powerful concept of adjacent individuals and adjacent communities inside the 3-D model. The full process is detailed and applied to five virtual entities inside and outside the industry. It raised a common view of 21 best attitudes. The paper provides managerial guidelines to managers of virtual entities.

J	Foxcroft, L; de Jager, H				Foxcroft, L.; de Jager, H.			Focus of IA departments on strategic risks of listed companies	SOUTHERN AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDITING RESEARCH-SAJAAR			English	Article						Assurance; audit; focus; intern audit; process; questionnaires; risk; scope; strategic risk		Since 2000 various companies including Enron and Tyco, have ended up throwing in the proverbial towel as major accounting fraud has led to their downfall. A diversity of other companies has followed suit due to the global financial crisis since 2008, and the escalating U.S. federal debt and deficit. This has merely intensified global pressure for the adoption of a risk focussed approach to internal audit (IA), especially when reviewing strategic risks. Strategic decision making and the implementation of those decisions during the still stuttering economic recovery is vital and will determine any firm's success or failure for many years to come. The global pressure for a risk focussed approach to IA has highlighted the fact that some of the most important risks that a company faces are strategic risks. In this paper, the involvement of IA functions in the context of strategic risk management is explored. The alignment of the IA function's strategy with the business's strategy is investigated, including the extent of IA's participation in strategic risk identification and management. The results of the research reported in this paper suggest that IA departments of Johannesburg Stock Exchange Limited (JSE) listed entities, whose chief audit executives (CAE) are members of the Institute of Internal Auditors, exclude strategic risk from their audit scope.

J	Ghobadian, A; O'Regan, N				Ghobadian, Abby; O'Regan, Nicholas			A case study and interview with Jill McDonald CEO and President of McDonald's Northern Europe Division	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						International Business; Value proposition; Non-related market strategies; Strategic decisions; Strategic innovation; Turnaround		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how strategy is developed and implemented within a subsidiary of a global organization, the relationship between subsidiary and headquarters and the need for continuous change and adaption to remain relevant. Furthermore, this case study describes a successful process of invention and adoption. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on documentary evidence and a semistructured interview with Jill McDonald CEO and President of McDonald's Northern Europe Division with responsibility for the UK, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway and the Republic of Ireland. Management research rarely captures the views of the top executive, yet the top executives have a broad picture and are key strategic decision makers. Findings - The case study and interview offers a unique insight into factors contributing to McDonald's unprecedented success (it has paid an increased dividend for the past 37 years). It also sheds light on its successful internationalization strategy. Originality/value - The case study draws on published material and augments this with an in-depth interview with the Chief Executive. Very few case studies offer insight into the thinking of a Chief Executive managing a subsidiary of a global organization. Its value lies in the lessons that managers and students of management can draw on the approach adopted by a highly successful global organization.

The main objectives of this research were to investigate the factors that predict strategic performance of supply chain by doing quantitative research at Iran Khodro Company (IKCO) in Iran. Based on supply chain theories, strategic performance of supply chain was predicted by Information Technology (IT), Organizational Learning (OL), and Product Innovation (PRI) in our research at the first time in an automotive company. Stratified random sampling was used to determine the sample size. Accordingly, 250 questionnaires were distributed among experts and supply chain specialists at IKCO. According to Supplying Automotive Parts Company (SPSC) variable as the main dependent variable, Path Analysis (PA) technique was used to explore casual relationships among variables using multiple regression analysis in SPSS. The Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was utilized based on Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis of normality, outliers, composite reliability, and validity to test hypotheses by using AMOS. PA, measurement model, and structural model were analyzed in order to examine the conceptual model. The results from multiple regression, path analysis, and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were same. Thus, all hypotheses were supported by SPSS and SEM analyses.

The Reform of Higher Education in China and the Republic of Korea: Application of International Practices for Modernization	VESTNIK MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGANIZATSII-INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS RESEARCH JOURNAL			Russian	Article						modernization; globalisation; university; regulation of higher education; consistency of reforms; international competitiveness; rankings of universities		This paper explores the history of higher education reforms in China and South Korea. The East Asian educational systems achievements are noted by many specialists and displayed in various quantitative parameters and rankings. The road that the East Asian universities passed during the last decades is very impressive. That's the reason why these particular countries - China and South Korea were selected as examples of successful modernization. In the analysis of educational transformations within the broader socio-economic context the authors introduce the notion of "consistency of reforms". This term illustrates the degree to which different governmental initiatives match each other, alignment of different elements of social policy. The paper is structure in three parts. The first section examines the experience of China and South Korea through the lens of federal-level regulations (macro-level). National historical conditions, with a focusing on the education systems structure and formats, which preceded the "globalization breakthrough" are described in details. The section explores the sequence of the governments' decisions which led to the current flexibility, openness and competitiveness of the Chinese and Korean higher education. The second section analyzes the same countries' experience at the micro-level: the curriculum and the strategic management of universities modernization. The organizational behavior and faculty relations are also in the focus of second section analysis. In conclusion the authors make an assumption that one of the key success factors of the Chinese and Korean universities modernization was the "consistency of reforms". A number of policy-related patterns are structured into a comparative table as evidence to this thesis.

J	Halikias, J; Salavou, HE				Halikias, John; Salavou, Helen E.			Generic business strategies of Greek exporting firms	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						generic business strategies; export performance; manufacturing firms; international management	PERFORMANCE; DETERMINANTS; SIZE	The primary aim of this study is to explore the strategy-export performance link by adapting Porter's (1980) classification scheme to an export context. Using a sample of 79 exporting firms established in Greece, this study employs a multiple linear regression model to examine the direct effect of generic business strategies on export sales intensity. The findings reveal that a differentiation strategy is an important contributor to export sales intensity for Greek manufacturing firms competing in the international arena. Given the negative effect of this strategic choice, recommendations for adapting the characteristics of differentiation have to be qualified. Obviously, when competing abroad, such an adaptation may require a thorough and systematic examination of the products or related services that are perceived to be sufficiently unique or valuable for customers to justify paying premium prices.

J	Hinkkanen, J; Vaatanen, J; Podmetina, D				Hinkkanen, Juha; Vaatanen, Juha; Podmetina, Daria			International Exploitation of Domestic R&D Exploration: New Insights from Russian Manufacturing Firms	JOURNAL OF EAST-WEST BUSINESS			English	Article						exploitation; exploration; international market expansion; R&D cooperation; Russia	ENTREPRENEURIAL FIRMS; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; SOCIAL NETWORKS; INNOVATION; COOPERATION; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; TRANSITION; VIEW; SMES	In this paper, we approach R&D cooperation and international market expansion from an exploration-exploitation perspective and look how various domestic R&D partners affect international market expansion activities in Russian firms. Our findings, based on a data survey of 206 manufacturing companies, show that different partners affect differently when it comes to market expansion and that their effect depends on a number of things such as the proximity of the international market. Using the exploration-exploitation approach, we are able to explain the phenomenon in more detail and so contribute to the existing international business and innovation management literature.

J	Ivang, R				Ivang, Reimer			A dual approach to IS strategy: two cases illustrating a dynamic, interaction-driven approach to IS strategy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						case study; group learning; dual organisation; information systems strategy; emergence; business environment; IS strategy; strategising		This paper discusses IS strategising and how the combination of the planning and the incremental approaches can enable successful IS strategising. IS strategising is conceptualised as a dual organisational process in which the network and the hierarchy positively coexist through group-learning processes. The findings from two case studies illustrate the theoretical framework. An analysis of 28 interviews reveal the complexity of IS strategising and show that IS strategising is best understood as a dual dynamic-interactive processing which the choice of strategic approach is not a dichotomy but more of a both/and decision. The overall conclusion is that IS strategy, because of increased uncertainty and environmental complexity, must encourage interaction between key stakeholders who implement and use the IS technology. The dual organisation and the experience-based group-learning processes help organise the process of IS strategising so that improvisational and dynamic competencies can emerge.

J	Jaaskelainen, A; Roitto, JM				Jaaskelainen, Aki; Roitto, Juho-Matias			Drivers of personnel satisfaction towards performance information usage Findings from Finnish municipalities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance management; Local administration; Performance information; Performance measurement maturity; Personnel satisfaction	PUBLIC-SECTOR; MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; MANAGEMENT; PRODUCTIVITY; GOVERNMENT; BENCHMARKING; FRAMEWORK; STATE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the drivers of personnel satisfaction towards performance information (PI) usage in the local public administration context. Design/methodology/approach - The study utilizes both quantitative and qualitative research approach. Data are gathered with a survey receiving 194 responses from the departments of six different municipalities that all belong to the group of largest municipalities in Finland. Regression and variance analysis, as well as analysis of open-ended comments are utilized. Findings - A key observation is that high maturity level of performance measurement or information systems do not guarantee personnel satisfaction. Three main perspectives are found to positively affect satisfaction: use of PI in strategic planning, inter-administrative management with PI and communication of measurement information. Research limitations/implications - Common limitations of survey studies apply. The quantitative data set could have been wider and it should be complemented with more qualitative data. Also the survey itself has limitations due to its generic nature. Practical implications - The results indicate that managerial purpose of measurement needs to be better clarified. Greatest need for development is found in utilizing PI in resource sharing and in the analysis of current situation supportive to strategic planning. Originality/value - The efficient use of performance measurement is a commonly acknowledged challenge. Even though PI usage has been increasingly studied, the focus has often been in separate managerial tasks. Wider approach towards performance measurement and management practices has gained less attention. This study is one of the first attempts to apply private sector originating performance measurement maturity discussion in the public sector context.

J	Jelavic, I; Vasic, D; Matesa, Z				Jelavic, Ivija; Vasic, Dina; Matesa, Zlatko			Strategic management implications to private higher education financing in post-communist countries - fundraising IESFF model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						financing; fundraising; higher education institutions; strategic management	STAKEHOLDER THEORY; BUSINESS SCHOOL	The main purpose of this paper is to define the importance of strategic management implication to private higher education financing in post-communist countries as well as to explain the custom made IESFF fundraising model for post-communist HEIs. As post-communist education lays on former political grounds, as well as the lack of the society experience in various philanthropic cases, the implementation of any funding based project within HEIs is a large and rather complex issue. Besides post-communist countries, there are developed education societies with all developed mechanisms for financing their activities. This is the part for introducing this first class HEIs that undertake funding for excellence no matter if it is private or public ones. The models of funding they are using are mainly dependent on their strategic decision making with the final purpose of creating the excellence. Due to the fact that HEIs have a competitive role in education market and act similar to a business, their fundraising strategic models have to be customized. Not all strategies or models are applicable to all HEIs.

We aimed to develop and implement an online decision pathway to aid General Practitioners (GPs) management decisions in suspected allergy. Our study involved 1487 GPs, 3 referral management centres, 5 GP system suppliers, 4 primary care trusts, and 1 specialist allergy clinic. The pathway was implemented by 3/5 GP system suppliers, published to Map of Medicine and on a specialist clinic website. In the first year, the pathway ranked in the top 10/160 local care maps accessed via Map of Medicine and was viewed 900 times. Only 96 GPs registered to use the clinic website. Only 110 (7%) GPs responded to the feedback request, of which 13/110 (12%) had used the pathway; nearly all thought it useful. It was used by referral management centres as explanation of rejected referrals. Alternative approaches to embed its use are required.

Our method quantifies the importance of features in the 3-D data based on gray level co-occurrence matrix texture analysis and represents the volume data using a simple mass-spring model. According to the measured importance value, blocks containing important features expand while other blocks shrink. After deformation, small features are exaggerated on deformed volume space, and more likely to survive during the uniform volume reduction. Experimental results showed that our method well preserved the small features of the original volume data during the reduction without any artifact compared with the previous methods. Although an additional inverse deformation process was required for the rendering of the deformed volume data, the rendering speed of the deformed volume data was much faster than that of the original volume data.

J	Kantarelis, D				Kantarelis, Demetri			The firm as a function of deals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Management; Contracts; Deals; Law; Theory of the firm		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to attempt a justification as to why a profit-making firm may be viewed as a function of its nucleus expertise and a risky portfolio of deals. Design/methodology/approach - This is a theoretical paper relying on mathematics, graphs and verbal arguments to describe concepts. Findings - A profit-making firm can gain even more if it reduces the risk of its portfolio of deals. In its effort to reduce such a risk, the firm needs to know each deal's profit share and be able to estimate each dealing partner's reliability (a random variable). Research limitations/implications - The proposed hypotheses are not empirically tested, an exercise left to future work. Practical implications - Pragmatically, a profit-making firm may be viewed as a function of its strategic nucleus and its strategic federation. The firm may increase its gains by minimizing deals' risk through a portfolio of deals diversification. The more the firm considers factors such as mediation, optimal commitments and the like, the more effective and efficient becomes the management of the portfolio of deals. Social implications - As explained through examples and illustrations, viewing the firm as a function of deals benefits the parties in such deals as well as other stakeholders (community, region, nation, etc), e.g. less costly deals contribute to more profit and more growth. Originality/value - A profit-making firm is viewed as an entity that manages a risky portfolio of promisor-and promisee-type deals. The ideas in this paper may be of value to today's global, knowledge-based, outsourcing/insourcing firms which may find it increasingly difficult to rely on conventional contracts.

J	Kharlov, IY				Kharlov, I. Yu			Forest Designation by Purpose as the Basis of Forest Management	LESNOY ZHURNAL-FORESTRY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						forest plan; forestry regulations; sustainable development; protective forests; designated areas; production forests; reserve forests		In 1998, Russian Federation declared its transition to sustainable development and reviewed its attitude to the fundamentals of forest management. In 2007, the state, as a constitutional guarantee of the preservation and stability of the environment, gave up the idea of being directly involved in economic activity and put its hopes on intensified business and cooperation with private companies by delegating some of its powers to regional authorities. Such a separation of powers between the federal center and the regions is in line with the principles of sustainable forest management aimed to develop areas in Russia. Nowadays, forest management is based on the concept of the forest as an ecological system, or as a natural resource. Due to this dual character of the "forest" notion, the theory and practice of forestry now differentiate between protection forests, production forests, and reserve forests. Designation by purpose is the core of the strategic planning of forest use and integrated development, including conservation, protection and restoration of forests, and is the basis for controlling the degree of impacts on forests. Analysis of the regulatory framework for designation of forests by their purpose shows that the current legal regulation in this sphere does not fully serve regional interests aimed at sustainable development of territories and does not contribute to sustainable forest management. At present, there is a need for additional functional classification of forests by their purpose and respective regional systems of forest management. The author shows that the existing in the Russian Federation classification, including both protective, production, and reserve forests, requires improvement in order to be further used in developing a set of measures for preservation and enhancement of the target functions of forests.

All data-act-trivial at the time November 23, 2014. When searching method was used snowball sampling. The choice of this method stems from the fact that the word competence (competence) was not the specificity nym and applicable only in the field of organizational psychology, and is a common word in English. As a result of filtering by name articles were found about 12,000 articles. To narrow your selection without losing quality, to compile lists used multiple techniques, in particular, clarifying the criteria used and were viewed "outbound" links (forward references) the first two articles on the competence-based approach (McClelland, 1973; White, 1959). The largest number of articles have been found in the interdisciplinary fields of psychology, management (mainly strategic), medicine, research, business, education.

However, especially implemented business processes do not sufficiently incorporate business objectives. Process managers are facing the challenge on how to optimize already established workflows in organizations based on strategic goals. This contribution proposes a new modeling approach that links business objectives with flow objects of business processes in a combined Strategy Process Matrix. Three basic optimization rules are derived to give process owners concrete recommendations for actions to increase the strategy achievement of processes. This transparent optimization approach is evaluated as a case study in customer support of a manufacturing company from Switzerland and demonstrates its benefits.

In mountains, snow avalanches are a particularly strong threat because, in addition to the victims and direct damage, they cause a lass of accessibility more or less prolonged when the networks are already strongly altered by seasonal closures. Specifically, risk to traffic roads caused by snow avalanches has been very rarely assessed at a regional scale. To assess the physical, human and functional vulnerabilities of road networks in three Alpine departments (Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Hautes-Alpes, Alpes-Maritimes), the first step of this research was to geo-locate and harmonize within a GIS all information sources about the consequences of avalanches on roads. This allowed identifying the road impacts of avalanches since 1937, to characterize the intensity and typology of damages and to evaluate the functional vulnerability of networks. The second step was to produce simple risk indexes of dysfunction and isolation at this regional scale. These indicators were modeled using the graph theory in a GIS framework, integrating avalanche activity indicators derived from the past activity with the road network. The obtained output maps should facilitate the decision support for crisis management and a comparative spatial analysis at the regional scale.

J	Letsoalo, JN				Letsoalo, Joseph Nthikeng			Productivity strategy led power utilities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Efficiency; Strategy; Productivity; Price recovery; Productivity Accounting		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to return to a long-term business focus that uses Productivity Accounting methodology as a strategy tool for business operation and for making investments to benefit all producers and consumers in the electricity markets. Design/methodology/approach - The research subjected the published annual financial reports data to an analysis using the Productivity Accounting methodology to fathom productivity and price recovery with a focus on productivity changes over the year. Assessment is made of any comments on productivity or efficiency by the utilities in relation to the computed productivity from the methodology of analysis. Findings - The financial data as well as the statistical data that went with it could be analysed independently and productivity and price recovery results obtained. It is possible use Productivity Accounting to measure productivity change and use it for influencing investment and operational productivity for each resource and the utility. Research limitations/implications - The focus is on power utilities that are experiencing shifts in the way they do business in the environment. However, there is definitely value in using productivity as a strategy for sustainable utilities. It would seem the results may be applicable to other types of businesses. Practical implications - It is possible for any utility to use Productivity Accounting as a strategic tool to run the operations and support that with continuous investments as a basis of productivity driven sustainable and profitable businesses. It highlights the faults of the booms and bust of the California power industry against a productivity strategy-led utility. Social implications - For both developing and developed countries it would mean that electricity is affordable in the long term as it is not a luxury good. Electricity can be used to leverage economies of countries for competitiveness. Originality/value - The paper provides a fresh look at productivity as a strategic focus of a sustained business performance, for all utilities based on their own unchanged data.

In this paper, we have proposed the closed loop model on smartphone switching heterogeneous wireless networks, which is full-client based without requiring additional support from the access points or gateways and modification of the network protocols. It only intuitively takes advantage of user scheme as the feedback adjustment approach to handoff policy. Furthermore, we have analyzed the closed loop handoff model to illustrate and evaluate how the user feedback of the policy acts on adapting to change context. In the experiment, we have evaluated four metrics on the closed loop handoff policy in real smartphone device: performance, energy saving, data offloading, and user experience.

Besides patent and citation counts, contribution indexes, Gross Contribution index, Technological Sector Contribution Index, and Technology Spillover index are introduced to show the impact of academic performance on development of industrial technologies of universities in Taiwan. The results indicate that both patent counts and contribution indexes present the research performance in development of industrial technologies, but reveal the meanings from diff erent facets. Patent count shows the productivity, while contribution index presents the contribution under the context, which takes gross productivity into consideration. From the distribution of annual patenting activities, not only can the research productivity be observed, but the strategic shift in applying diff erent types of patents.

Aligning Web content and organisational strategy: Towards increasing funding	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							QUALITY; FRAMEWORK; DESIGN; SITES	Background: The effectiveness with which the Aurum Institute manages to communicate its organisational strategic objectives through its website was investigated. Despite its ground breaking research and programs which have made a positive impact on the community, the major problem that it faces is funding its core. Objectives: An investigation of the website's content was carried out to determine the extent to which the organisational strategy is reflected to potential funders visiting the site. Requirements for aligning the content with the organisational strategy were identified. Method: Content analysis was used where secondary data, such as website content and organisational strategic objectives, was analysed. An interview was also conducted with Aurum's knowledge manager to gain an in-depth understanding of the organisation's strategic objectives and to validate the initial findings. Results: The results show that the website content was not effectively representative of Aurum's strategic objectives, and that the website structure did not effectively share the information that supports the decision-making process of potential investors. Recommendations were presented to the organisation in the form of a prototype website which reflects the desired website content that is representative of Aurum's strategic objectives. Conclusion: Further research is required in determining the effect that a strategically driven website could possibly exert on the funding potential of the organisation. The theoretical approach used in this study can be used as a scoping exercise in organisations of a similar business nature.

J	Meddeb, O; Ben Abdelaziz, F; Figueira, JR				Meddeb, Olfa; Ben Abdelaziz, Fouad; Figueira, Jose Rui			Generalized manipulability of fuzzy social choice functions	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Fuzzy preference relation; fuzzy social choice functions; strategic manipulation; manipulability	WELFARE FUNCTIONS; AGGREGATION; PREFERENCES; RULES	In many social decision making contexts, a manipulator attempts to change the social choice in his favor by misrepresenting his preferences. This paper deals with the strategic manipulation problem of social choice functions aggregating fuzzy individual preferences. It defines how the strategic misrepresentation of fuzzy preferences can be profitable for an individual with a fuzzy weak preference relation. The case of max-inverted perpendicular-transitive fuzzy preference relations is considered where inverted perpendicular is a t-norm. Then, the impossibility of building a non-manipulable fuzzy social choice function except the dictatorial one is established, generalizing thus the well-known Gibbard-Satterthwaite's result. The obtained results generalizes also the one of Ben Abdelaziz et al. for max-min transitive fuzzy preference relations.

The influence of CEO attributes on strategic orientation towards R&D and strategic fit in Indian public sector units	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						chief executive officers; Indian public sector units; research and development; India		Chief executive officers play a vital role in the strategic initiatives regarding R&D and innovation, and to ensure strategic fit. In the globalised environment, focus on research and development is more important to gain competitive advantage. Hence, this work is carried out to understand and explore the influence of CEO on the strategic orientation in Indian public sector units. An empirical study was conducted, using research instrument designed to survey CEOs, in public sector units. Data collected from 74 public sector units were analysed using multiple regression and correlation. The analysis indicated that CEO characteristics, job attitude, and focus towards R&D influence the formulation of R&D vision in Indian PSUs, weakly. In addition, the study also revealed various other factors of importance that must have been the major concerns for the sickness of many public sector units. The study unveils the probable reasons for lack of growth in the sector.

J	Metzinger, TC; Boras, D				Metzinger, Tamara Cendo; Boras, Damir			ESG Standards and Guidelines and Information Management at Higher Education Institutions in Croatia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						ESG standards; higher education institutions; information management; quality assurance		Higher education institutions are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of establishing and assuring the quality system in the area of higher education. In the European higher education area the quality assurance, assessment of the work quality and achieved results at the higher education institutions is based on the European standards and guidelines (ESG). In order to achieve the high quality level, the higher education institutions have to permanently collect and analyse information about the study programmes, teaching and administrative staff, satisfaction of students and other stakeholders of the higher education institutions. Relevant information represent thus one of the most important resources of the higher education institutions and are an inevitable factor of success and development with information management imposed as imperative. Collecting, analysing, using and exchange of all relevant information among all the system stakeholders in order to realize the strategic objectives and quality assurance of the higher education institutions are particularly processed by ESG standards related to information systems and public information. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to research the importance and the role of information management at the higher education institutions in the Republic of Croatia regarding the level of development of ESG standards which refer to the access to information of the quality assurance system and public information.

J	Milano, C				Milano, Carmela			Democratization or vulgarization of cultural capital? The role of social networks in theater's audience behavior	ENCATC JOURNAL OF CULTURAL MANAGEMENT AND POLICY			English	Article						Theater management; Art consumer research; Social networks; Cultural capital		This paper investigates the participation in social networks of theater's audiences. Our purpose is to observe and understand the role of social networks in the consumption behavior of the theater field. We put the accent on the concept of cultural capital with its social dimension. We realize an exploratory study that consists in a dozen of qualitative semistructured interviews with theater's audiences that participate in social networks. We provide an analytical framework based on uses, influences and perceptions of changing in social stratification in theaters. We reveal two kinds of perception: a positive one and a negative one that we denominate democratization effect and vulgarization effect. Our findings help cultural institutions to have a better understanding of who are the theater audiences and how they act. On an operational level, our study offers information to art's managers interested about the strategic use of Web 2.0 tools.

J	Mouraviev, N; Kakabadse, N				Mouraviev, Nikolai; Kakabadse, Nada			"Rules of engagement" How experiential learning facilitates the formation of a public-private partnership in Russia	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Russia; Experiential learning; Concession; Concrete experience; Public-private partnership (PPP); Social environment		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate to what extent one can apply experiential learning theory (ELT) to the public-private partnership (PPP) setting in Russia and to draw insights regarding the learning cycle's nature. Additionally, the paper assesses whether the PPP case confirms Kolb's ELT. Design/methodology/approach - The case study draws upon primary data which the authors collected by interviewing informants including a PPP operator's managers, lawyers from Russian law firms and an expert from the National PPP Centre. The authors accomplished data source triangulation in order to ensure a high degree of research validity. Findings - Experiential learning has resulted in a successful and a relatively fast PPP project launch without the concessionary framework. The lessons learned include the need for effective stakeholder engagement; avoiding being stuck in bureaucracy such as collaboration with Federal Ministries and anti-trust agency; avoiding application for government funding as the approval process is tangled and lengthy; attracting strategic private investors; shaping positive public perception of a PPP project; and making continuous efforts in order to effectively mitigate the public acceptance risk. Originality/value - The paper contributes to ELT by incorporating the impact of social environment in the learning model. Additionally, the paper tests the applicability of ELT to learning in the complex organisational setting, i.e., a PPP.

J	Nam, T				Nam, Taewoo			Assessing Operational and Collaborative Performance Management: A Case Study of PhillyStat	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						performance management; performance review; CitiStat; PerformanceStat; case study		Many cities and agencies in the U.S. have adopted the "-Stat" approach, which is called "PerformanceStat" in general. Philadelphia has created PhillyStat as its performance management and tracking tool, of which unique feature is its twofold review process involving both operational and outcome level. This study assesses the capacities of PhillyStat. The assessment suggests four implications for jurisdictional governments and agencies employing the "-Stat" approach. First, the "-Stat" approach should evolve toward strategic review beyond day-today operational review. Second, the "-Stat" approach should close the gap in diverse views on government performance. Third, the "-Stat" approach should be used as an effective tool for public management and leadership. Last, the "-Stat" approach should develop capabilities for cross-organizational collaboration.

SOCIAL ASPECTS OF THE INNOVATION MANAGEMENT IN ORGANIZATION	RUDN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY-VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV SERIYA SOTSIOLOGIYA			Russian	Article						innovative management in the organization; social management; social well-being of employees; social aspects of innovation management; social development		The unstable economics as well as difficulties associated with lack and scarcity of human, financial and investment resources cause the tightening of requirements to the organizational management. The market economy demands a systematic approach to the management based on the strategic planning combined with an opportunity to make situational decisions. Such management models are difficult to use for they require a lot of resources the lack of which is usually a marker of a crisis situation. That is why at the moments of the so called 'market turbulence' and socio-economic reduction indicators, organizations have to reduce the costs of management and social development that helps in a short-term perspective, but in the future can destabilize the organization and make it more vulnerable to the new 'wave of crisis'. One of possible ways to preserve organizational stability is to apply innovative methods of management. Currently, the problems of innovation management are widely reported in the scientific and business literature focusing on the creation and implementation of the management innovations technologies that promise the greatest dividends, while the authors rarely consider the impact of the innovative management on employees' social well-being, social development and social capital focusing on the staff resistance to innovations despite the fact that any innovation produces profound changes in the system of social management. Thus, the article aims at the theoretical study of innovation management factors' impact on the social aspects of organizational life and states that the implementation of innovations into the organization management without taking into consideration their possible consequences for the social state of the organization in the long run is totally unacceptable.

The paper analyses the key aspects of the crisis that regional PSB Radio televizija Vojvodine-RTV (Vojvodina Broadcasting Company) has faced since 2005, drawing attention to the lack of strategic performance management over the years. The general framework of the distinguished authors' ideas on the nature and causes of the crisis of European PSBs is provided by comparing those supporting the survival of the PSBs as the "public good" mediating "public values", with the ones criticising severely the "privileged" market position and "continuous state assistance".

Our main contribution is a simulation model that helps service providers analyze the consequences of changes in both the service capacity assigned to their customers and the tendency of service requests received on the fulfillment of a business rule associated with the strategic goal of customer satisfaction. This business rule is set in the SLAs that service provider and its customers agree to, which determine the maximum percentage of service requests that are permitted to be abandoned because they have exceeded the waiting time allowed. To illustrate the use and applications of the model, we include some of the experiments conducted and describe our conclusions.

This case legitimates the unethical activities of the spin doctors who accept every ways as accurate to achieve the success as well as of PR experts who gathers the principles of accuracy, reliability, understandability and ethic. In recent year, the deviation from the true, current, detailed information and transparency principles stated in the declaration of principles by Ivy Lee, has increased by the diversification of people profile who prefer this field. Due to the people who become spin doctor because of their lack of moral value or their secret entering to structure, the profession of PR which has a great change is in danger of losing the mission of improving the mutual confidence, respect and social responsibility between the organization and target group. In this study, it was evaluated that unethical achievements provided by strategical tactics of spin doctors, as a PR expert, have an threat on PR profession and it was aimed to determine the map of principles for a PR operator in case of spin doctors and being spin doctors.

It also identifies the most critical success factors (CSFs) for mobile retailing implementation through retailing process reengineering (RPR) framework. Design/methodology/approach - This paper attempts to identify a few CSFs through questionnaire survey and interview, subsequently establishing the inter-factor relationships through interpretive structural modeling framework and computing the priority weights of the interrelated factors using analytic network process. Finally, the authors compute the retailers' RPR implementation readiness indices for mobile retailing using Multi-Level data envelopment analysis methodology. Findings - The 11 CSFs have been identified. Out of these, two factors namely Strategic Alignment and Management Control and Quality Contribute profoundly for mobile retailing implementation. Finally, a readiness index has been computed for implementation of mobile retailing in the selected retail outlets through RPR framework. Research limitations/implications - Only a few selected large retail outlets have been considered in this study and the sample size was modest. This study only revolves around the Indian retail sector. Practical implications - This study can be used as a decision support system for mobile retailing implementation in Indian retail sector. Moreover, based on the results of this study, a few retail outlets are completely ready for mobile retailing implementation. Apart from them, the other retail outlets can improve their readiness index by emphasizing on performance scores of the CSFs. Originality/value - Due to the scanty literature on mobile retailing, this study contributes to the mobile retailing body of literature in three ways: first, identification of CSFs in mobile retailing; second, interrelationship among the factors; and third, proposes a rational framework to compute retail outlets' readiness indices for the implementation of mobile retailing through RPR framework.

J	Leon, JDP				Pelaez Leon, Juan David			CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN COLOMBIA: CHALLENGES TO STRENGTHEN A STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP	REVISTA CIENCIAS ESTRATEGICAS			Spanish	Article						Corporate Social Responsibility; human resource management; strategic management	CSR; HRM; PERFORMANCE; ETHICS; MODEL	This article presents Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Human Resources as two strategic approaches for organizations with challenges when both converge in the Colombian context. The study was conducted based on a literature review in indexed journals involving Human Resources and CSR in Colombia since 2000, after which CSR became regarded as part of organizational management strategies (Porter and Kramer, 2002, 2006; Dentchev, 2004). This document describes the evolution of CSR and Human Resources in Colombia, and includes the reports that have linked these two approaches. Based on the studies reviewed, this article also presents what has been proposed in the Colombian context as well as some challenges and research proposals to strengthen this relationship, which has been considered strategic as it adds value to companies, and is of interest to managers, human resource workers, and scholars.

The purpose of this paper is to review the existing frameworks for analysing and understanding competitiveness and especially their application within an industry. In order that, this initiative to study and measure the attractiveness of the industry, to develop and find the proper implementation, it is necessary to build the field and infrastructure through which it will be possible to understand and measure indicators such as attractiveness, rivalry among firms, competitive position in the industry and the strategic choices. Based on this review, it is given the way in which each industry can be studied and, above all, to test the extent of application of the model and the theory of Porter in the Albanian business environment.

Using Benefit Transfer to Estimate Average Relative Marginal Values for Wildland Fire Program Planning	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY			English	Article						nonmarket valuation; value transfer; benefit transfer; cluster analysis; regression tree analysis		We developed a set of generalized value categories and average relative marginal values using resource and valuation information collected at seven federal land management planning units in the USA. The categories and average values are intended to be used for rapid strategic wildland fire program planning or as foundation values for a more extended planning effort. To divide the original information into logical and statistically valid value categories, we used a k-means cluster analysis combined with expert knowledge of how each resource type is managed with respect to fire. After we established the value categories, we performed a regression tree analysis to estimate an average relative marginal value for each category under different combinations of ecosystem condition and fireline intensity. Average values for each category are as expected and the regression tree fits are excellent with R-2 values ranging from .895 to .948. The results of this study can be used to identify general resource types for planning or other valuation analyses and they provide a low cost way to transfer nonmarket value information between similar planning sites.

Furthermore it presents the results of a literature review on human resource management and firm innovativeness. The literature shows that the positive relationship between HRM and firm innovativeness has been confirmed. However, the explanation for how this relationship works is not equivocal/unified. Empirical studies have investigated the role of strategic HRM, specific HRM systems and HRM practices. For strategic HRM, the empirical support is still limited, while for HRM systems considerable work confirms the positive influence of commitment-based HRM. For HRM practices, in particular training, working in teams, and internal labour flexibility, including job rotation, the literature provides empirical evidence and indications that they are positively related to firm innovativeness.

J	Salleh, MAM				Salleh, Mohd Azul Mohamad			ONLINE COMMUNICATION SATISFACTION TOWARDS THE USE OF INTERNET-BASED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS: A STUDY AT FOUR RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN MALAYSIA	JURNAL KOMUNIKASI-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Online communication satisfaction; technology acceptance; information management systems; research university; online system		Information and communication technology (ICT) now provides the means for more interactive and collaborative forms of participation in organizations. The growth of the Internet and Web 2.0 has led to a rapid development of online systems in organizations, where often the first domain to be designed has the priority aim of enhancing organizational communications processes within the area of staff interaction. Adapting the communication satisfaction and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the study examines online communication satisfaction in using an Internet- based information management systems (IBIMS). Its findings on the effect of ease of use and usefulness on communication satisfaction are based on a survey of 223 employees at four research universities in Malaysia. The results indicate that there is a positive and significant relationship between these variables in using IBIMS. The study contributes to an enhanced understanding of how organizations might better achieve strategic and effective communication by considering ease of use and communication satisfaction in their choice and implementation of online systems.

Traditional context data collection approaches are based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) over Internet Protocol (IP), which has several disadvantages, such as lack of efficient mobility support, security and data transfer efficiency. Content-Centric Networking (CCN), on the other hand, provides advantages in terms of mobility, security and bandwidth efficiency in comparison with IP. In this paper, we introduce our user-centric comprehensive context management framework, and propose a secure and efficient context data collection and provision approach based on the framework using CCN as a network and transport layer. This context collection approach provides a flexible security mechanism by introducing three levels of security type. It also provides bandwidth efficiency by taking advantage of CCN's content caching; performance evaluation results show that our approach can reduce bandwidth consumption up to 99% for pull and up to 46% for push in comparison to a UDP/IP-based system. Our approach also provides advantages in supporting mobility and leveraging multiple interfaces. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Slee, M				Slee, Melissa			Learning to navigate enterprise bargaining: the process of innovation and adaptation in the union movement	LABOUR & INDUSTRY-A JOURNAL OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS OF WORK			English	Article						academic employment; enterprise bargaining; trade union renewal; trade union strategy	ORGANIZING MODEL; TRADE-UNIONS; COMMUNITIES; KNOWLEDGE	Recent literature relating to trade union renewal is devoted to how union organisations build the capacity to respond and adapt to external threats and opportunities in a turbulent and hostile environment. This paper is concerned with the specific situation where the regulatory framework suddenly, fundamentally changes, requiring major change in a union's strategic direction. What processes are involved in driving major change within union organisations to enable them to adapt to changes in their environment? Enlisting research from the field of knowledge management enables an analysis of the process of learning and adaptation within organisations that provides new answers to this important question. Studying major change in the trade union movement also raises issues of path dependency, strategic inertia and 'group think'. Using the case of the National Tertiary Education Industry Union (NTEU) in Australia as it changed its strategic direction to cope with the implementation of full enterprise bargaining following the election of the coalition government in 1996, it is clear that adaptation to changes in the external environment is not necessarily a uniform or linear process but will likely be accompanied by clashes of opinion and battles for influence as new ideas confront the collective learning of the past.

J	Smith, S; Winchester, D; Clegg, S; Pang, V				Smith, Stephen; Winchester, Donald; Clegg, Stewart; Pang, Vincent			Collaboration as a Strategic Service in Government Online Communities	JOURNAL OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Change; IT platform; collaboration as a service; NSW government; electronic government; case study; power relations		This study investigates strategic innovation changes designed to facilitate 'Collaboration as a Service' that were undertaken on information technology platform sites hosting online communities by NSW state government agencies in Australia. The initial platform hosted the Guardianship Tribunal site dealing with people that have disabilities. The second platform involved working groups (WGs). The third platform hosted knowledge resource centre user group sites. A WG focusing on climate change issues that collaborated within and across agencies, as well as with outside organizations was investigated. A feature of the climate change group is that it requires data and collaboration from many agencies with a future-oriented function and duration of 20+ years. Overall, the WGs perform better following the adoption and implementation of collaborative tools resulting in the benefits of there being a single-point document, reduced duplication of information and effort and a design that complements WG operational activities. Lessons were learned from changes in service delivery for the design of face-to-face services that drove pre-implementation factors and assisted change and collaboration in earlier platforms through enhancing later sites features and functionality limiting user resistance. However, the organizational change contributed to enhanced centralization and panopticism of organizational power relations.

J	Szirmai, V				Szirmai, Viktoria			THE SOCIAL WELL-BEING ISSUES OF THE EUROPEAN URBANISATION STAGES AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF THEIR MANAGEMENT BY THE CREATION OF SPATIAL CONFIGURATIONS	DETUROPE-THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TOURISM			English	Article						Social wellbeing; European urbanisation; Social tension; Social configuration		Cities today play strategic roles in modernization processes as well as in the organization and operation of global economy. Big cities are the places where the conditions of modernisation, economic and social development, the operating conditions of global economy, the educated and qualified middle-class, members of the economic, political and cultural elite are concentrated. Meanwhile modern urban spaces are rather controversial. A variety of social problems, the traditional and new structures of local social inequalities, the historical and present day poverty, traditional and modern crime, environmental problems are all present. Various urban problems were also present in the historically changing stages of urban development. Taking the actual historical and social conditions into account, theories, criticisms, and various scientific approaches offered differentiated solutions - mainly based on spatial principals - to manage urban tensions. As urban conflicts keep reproducing and new tensions keep appearing these tools do not seem to succeed in managing these tensions, which is probably due to the one-dimensional aims of intervention. Management proposals regarding particular urbanisation stages were mainly based on spatial principals, they were one-dimensional, and they were not accompanied with schemes targeting structural effects. The aims of this study to present the various urban problems connected to the different urbanisation stages, as well as the proposals based on spatial principles which were aspiring to solve these problems and to evaluate these proposals. A further aim is to describe a complex structural management theory, which is very promising from the aspect of structural effects but lack the spatial approach. Finally this study aims to present a research whose aspiration is to connect the two different approaches empirically.

It is a prized but simultaneously highly vulnerable, corporate asset and at the same time one of the most difficult to protect. No company is able to protect itself from committing some errors and avoiding the risk of reputation loss or damage. Although it is not possible to eliminate reputation risk, it is possible to limit the probability of a crisis and the influence of its effects. It requires monitoring and control of the factors as well as the sources of risk and protection of procedures and tools which could be launched immediately after occurrence of an undesirable event. So this is what the management of reputation risk is about. As an example companies that identified the sources and was able to deal with the reputation's crisis is Toyota.

Therefore, companies will form the most strategic decision to remain competitive in the market to attract and retain investors. Corporate governance and financial performance are important elements considered by investors before they decide on where to place their investment funds. Thus, the study of corporate governance and its effect on the efficiency of financial performance becomes an interesting decision-making tool and is a reference point that assists investors to predict the influence of the corporate governance on the capital they invest. Results of this study show that firm size and CEO/chairman duality significantly influence the efficiency of corporate governance in generating financial performance. Surprisingly, setting risk management committee made no difference in financial performance.

J	Yu, VF; Kuo, CW; Yeh, RH				Yu, Vincent F.; Kuo, Catherine W.; Yeh, Ruey Huei			Decision Process Analysis on Project Priority Strategy: A Case Study of an ICT Design Firm	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article							ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT; SUCCESS; MODEL; SYSTEM; IMPACT; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; SUPPORT	Project priority strategy is the benchmarking of a corporate operation management strategy and in particular is used by a projects-based research and development firm in the complex competence environment of the information and communication technology (ICT) industry. This research takes the variables of external environments and internal resources into account for a firm's market, technology, and finance assets in order to present a decision process on a project priority strategy. This empirical study also addresses the key factors of the interaction between business on a project development's supply chain: clients, the examined firm, and suppliers. The findings indicate that a profit-driven project can dominate the firm's strategic operations and management from the resource-based view and analytic hierarchy process technique perspectives. At the same time, the analysis results contribute significant values to project decision management, which is highly recommended for small-medium enterprises conducting product/project development, project portfolio management, and strategic business management.

J	Zaman, T; Yeo, AW; Kulathuramaiyer, N				Zaman, Tariq; Yeo, Alvin Wee; Kulathuramaiyer, Narayanan			Knowledge Management in Nonprofit Settings: A Case Study of Indigenous Knowledge Management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE DIGITAL AGE			English	Article						Balanced Scorecard; Indigenous Communities; Indigenous Knowledge; Indigenous Knowledge Management; Nonprofit Settings		A well formulated framework depicts the embedded relationships between influencing factors and provides a simplified and assimilative description of the complex knowledge management systems. In organizations, creation of models and frameworks for designing knowledge management tools is a well established practice while there is a lack of a comprehensive framework for Indigenous Knowledge Management System (IKMS). Hence, the research question addressed in this paper is whether the organisational knowledge management frameworks can be used to strategies Indigenous Knowledge Management (IKM) in a meaningful way. The paper presents Balanced Scorecard (BSc) for IKM in indigenous communities as a case study of nonprofit setting. With the help of empirical data, this work explains four main strategic management processes of BSc approach. The paper argues that, although BSc is found to be useful in many organisations and indigenous community related project, care should be taken when it is implemented for IKM, where the nature of management activities is totally different.

The Impact of Software Testing Governance Choices	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL AND END USER COMPUTING			English	Article						Information Technology (IT); IT Governance; IT Managers; Software Development; Software Testing; Software Testing Governance	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT; CONFLICT; BUSINESS; PERFORMANCE; DEVELOPERS; MANAGEMENT; QUALITY	Software testing is becoming a critical component of software development, especially because of the proliferation of complex, interconnected, and real-time business applications. As a result, information technology (IT) managers are struggling with pragmatic governance mechanisms for integrating testing with development. Governance issues pertaining to how software testing is organized at strategic, tactical, and operational levels, however, have not received adequate attention in the literature. This study explores the impact of three specific governance mechanisms, including the existence of a distinct corporate testing unit, developers and testers reporting to different executives, and the existence of one-to-one matching between developers and testers, on the organizational integration of testing with development. A national survey of 196 software development and testing professionals was undertaken to investigate the impact of these governance variables on a set of dependent variables comprising organizational, group, and individual outcomes.

The objective of such assessments is to ensure that potential negative impacts on both protected nature conservation sites and species and wider biodiversity are efficiently identified in a timely manner, quantified and subsequently avoided or mitigated, while enhancing positive effects. The procedural requirements of these legal obligations vary and, as a result, differing methodological steps, data gathering and analysis methods, and impact assessment techniques are commonly applied under each individual process, often leading to uncoordinated assessment efforts and results (in terms, for example, of scope, scale and assessment detail). In order to address these issues and improve current practice, an Integrated Biodiversity Impact Assessment (IBIA) methodology has been developed in Ireland with the overall aim of providing a holistic and systematic approach to biodiversity impact assessment. The IBIA framework seeks to ensure that relevant procedures are effectively integrated, time and resource efficiencies are optimised, and unnecessary duplication avoided. Particular emphasis is given to compliance with legal requirements, integration and communication of scientific knowledge, spatial assessment and biodiversity data considerations, and integration of biodiversity aspects with a variety of other concerns during the plan-making process. This paper presents the IBIA methodology and critically examines current key issues in biodiversity impact assessment that can be potentially addressed through IBIA, as well as remaining challenges. In addition, and in order to support the examination of the anticipated benefits of using this new methodological framework (such as biodiversity-inclusive planning through improved communication and coordinated assessment), two contrasting case studies are used, one pre-dating the development of IBIA and a second where elements of IBIA have been implemented.

However, there is still a detailed and developing discussion that makes strategic planning a new terminology later in used. Elements discussed in the topic are also very much similar and indeed encouraged in Islamic viewpoint. The various conceptual discussions on planning has stimulated this writing to analyze what the practicality in Malaysia are with special focus on high education learning. Therefore, this paper will put forward some strategic planning elements based on the Qur'an, Sunnah and Islamic history. It is based on the ability of Islam in solving the current problems across the continent and Europe. In addition, this paper will also touch on aspects of the practice of planning efforts in the development of higher education in Malaysia. In higher education, the Ministry of Higher Education has introduced the National Higher Education Strategic Plan (PSPTN) which aims to transform higher education in the context of Malaysia as a hub of excellence for higher education. The main emphasis of the practice is devoted to strategic planning elements of Islam that are less emphasized in the process of implementation. These elements are seen as a mechanism towards development planning in line with the tenets of Islam. Thus, besides giving two approaches of strategic planning, namely, modern and Islamic views, this article underlines efforts taken by the Ministry to fulfill one of its core plans that is internationalization. Elements of strategic planning is analysed, including the Islamic emphasis on social cost factor which is a challenge to be addressed to improve the Ministry strategic plan approach.

Of particular interest is the extent to which divergent and contesting understandings may lead to positive synergies or conflict, and whether managers' reflections may function as a means of justifying a particular mindset or course of action, provoking either contestation or acceptance within the organisation (e.g. Parker, 2000). Thus, the findings provide insight into the relation between discourse, that is, talk as (inter) action, and the development and enactment of organisational culture, contributing valuable and practice-oriented knowledge to the field of cross-cultural management. The data for the analysis are derived from 10 semi-structured interviews, which were conducted in the Danish headquarters and the Ukrainian division, respectively, securing a broad intraorganisational representation of voices.

J	Kieran, J; Bligh, G; Jenny Kwai-Sim, L				Kieran, James; Bligh, Grant; Jenny Kwai-Sim, Leung			AN ANALYSIS OF SINGAPORE'S AWARE CASE	JEBAT-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY POLITICS AND STRATEGIC STUDIES			English	Article						Activism; Civil society; Grassroots activism; Internet activism; Non-Government Organizations; Opposition parties; Singapore politics; Singapore opposition parties		Our case involves the women's group Association of Women for Action and Research ( AWARE), founded on 25 November 1985, which has proven itself to be a tireless long-term campaigner for women's rights in Singapore. In this 'AWARE case', the executive committee of AWARE was surreptitiously taken over by fundamentalist Christian women from Church of Our Saviour at AWARE's 28 March 2009 Annual General Meeting. In the second phase of this saga, the Extraordinary General Meeting on 2 May 2009 led to the secular 'Old Guard' recapturing AWARE and the Church of Our Saviour group being removed from power. This AWARE case shows the rise in power of fundamentalist Protestant Christianity within Singapore and its growing influence upon English-educated Chinese-Singaporeans. The fact that this upper middle-class demographic traditionally has supported the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) is probably one key reason why the government decided not to intervene in this particular case as part of 'the more consultative style of government' first introduced by former PM Goh Chok Tong. The PAP government's non-intervention in the takeover and recapture is extremely significant given its past record of authoritarian micro-management of dissent and oppositional opinions. It suggests more freedom for some NGOs in the contemporary era of Lee Hsien Loong's prime-ministership. Significantly, PAP may be splitting into 'reformist' and 'hardline' factions headed by, respectively, Lee Hsien Loong and the MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC Mr Wong Kan Seng.

J	Kubacki, K; Sluszniak, A				Kubacki, Konrad; Sluszniak, Agnieszka			Economic development path of Poland: innovation and competitiveness in light of the situation of Southern European countries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Economic development; Government policy; Competitiveness; Innovativeness		The financial crisis of 2007 revealed structural weaknesses in many European countries, particularly in Southern Europe. The goal of this article is to identify the existing economic situation in the four main Southern European countries: Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain (GIPS), and in Poland, conduct a comparative analysis of the development paths and competitiveness levels of these countries using statistical data as well as existing scientific literature, and finally to formulate suggestions for a new development path of Poland. The results of the analysis suggest that Poland's development is currently on a turning point, portraying many similarities to Southern European economies after their EU accession, as well as before the crisis. The authors come to a conclusion that unless Poland undertakes crucial reforms, particularly in the field of its innovation system, business environment, implementation of EU funds, and overall strategic long-term planning, it is inevitable that its economic growth will slow down, possibly falling into a middle-income trap. Poland might not avoid the same mistakes of GIPS, that failed to implement adequate reforms in times of economic growth, what today results in suffering from serious consequences. This paper presents a unique view on the future economic development of Poland in relation to the paths already undertaken by Southern European economies.

J	Machado, R				Machado, Ricardo			Supply chain management: survey in the Brazilian pharmaceutical industry	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Supply chain management; SCOR model; Brazilian pharmaceutical industry		This research analyses the supply chain management performance of the pharmaceutical industry in Brazil, from the SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference) Model point of view, taking five business processes in consideration: planning, supplying, producing and distributing. A survey was conducted in ten pharmaceutical companies located in Goias, in the country Centre. The results indicates competition takes place between companies and not between supply chains, very little integration occurs between their links (partners), but wrapped in operational information such as quantity and time, than in relation to strategic issues such as planning along the chain. The industries have a great concern about the quality of their products, because this is an essential aspect of competition in the sector. They are far more shrouded with issues of internal improvements than improving the performance of the supply chain as a whole.

The need for water consumption, water transport, water-based industry, water defense etc. influenced a city's history and development. However, the last decades show a continuing concern for the aesthetics of a city's waterfront. Based on the idea that "waterfront is an extraordinary resource for a city, to be used 'strategically' to revitalize and reinforce its economy and to 'build' or consolidate its specific 'image' (Bruttomesso, 2006) cities on the Danube developed major waterfront reconstruction programs. However, Danube's landscape potential in Romanian cities is seldom exploited. Calarasi city's new urban projects now include the redevelopment of both its Danube riverfront and its main arteries. The aims are to revitalize a former industrial city image and to invite the people to regain both the city's riverfront and its unexploited public spaces. To this end, research was conducted on both the city's inhabited structure and on the urban unexploited landscape potential. The results and diagnosis led to drawing strategic directions on future urban landscape transformation and on applying concrete concepts for landscape management. The strategy proposes incorporation of old, new and future social-urban poles into a modern and coherent urban system. Detailed solutions have been proposed for key urban development areas and for small squares and green strips alike.

Exploration of key stakeholders' preferences for pre-hospital physiologic monitoring by emergency rescue services	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Rescue work; Emergency medical services; Patient monitoring; Medical device design	MOUNTAIN RESCUE; RESPIRATORY RATE; SEARCH	To gather preferences for novel pre-hospital physiologic monitoring technologies from emergency rescue services. Qualitative semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with three groups from UK Search and Rescue (SAR); (1) Extractors (e.g. SAR teams), (2) Transporters (personnel primarily responsible for casualty transport), and (3) Treaters (e.g. Emergency Department doctors). Three themes were defined; SAR casualty management, novel physiologic monitor potential, and physiologic monitor physical properties. Some SAR groups already employed physiologic monitoring but there was no consensus on which monitor(s) to carry or what to monitor and how frequently. Existing monitors also tended to be bulky and heavy and could be unreliable in an unstable environment or if the casualty was cold. Those performing monitoring tended to have only basic first-aid training, and their workload was often high particularly if there was more than one casualty. The potential benefits of employing a novel monitor were strategic and clinical; an opportunity for transmitting data off-scene in order to facilitate monitoring or generate advice (i.e. telemedicine) was also voiced. A range of more intuitive, physical properties was also raised (e.g. small/compact, lightweight). SAR-specific technology should be simple to operate by those with less medical training, which means that clinical data interpretation and presentation should be carefully considered. It would be beneficial if novel monitors carried out a majority of the interpretation, allowing rescuers to proceed with their priority task of removing the casualty to safety.

J	Pavlinovic, S				Pavlinovic, Sladana			ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PRODUCTION AND LABELLING	MANAGEMENT-JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY MANAGEMENT ISSUES			English	Article							COMPETITION	Firms' strategic behaviour regarding environmentally friendly practices is modelled using evolutionary game theory and replicator dynamics. We elaborated the choice of technology and labelling practices when firms performed as bounded rational agents and considered revision of their strategies only occasionally. The framework is information asymmetric because the consumers do not observe a firm type directly, but can infer it indirectly through the market price. We explored the technology strategies of eco-labelled firms. We found that there was an interior unstable state which divided the basins of attraction of two exterior stable states, one where all certified firms were polluting, and another where all certified firms were non-polluting. In order to foster adoption of non-polluting technology, the government should introduce more frequent monitoring and higher penalties for non-alignment with eco-label requirements. We also explored adoption of ecolabels when technology is given and we found an interior evolutionary stable state where certified and non-certified polluting firms co-existed. That is, a part of the polluting firms mimicked non-polluting ones by eco-labelling their own products. Finally, we conclude that the government may choose between an improvement in minimum environmental standards or stricter monitoring in order to de-stimulate false eco-labelling of polluting firms.

Public relations, which provides two-way communication between the management and its public and acts as a bridge between the parties, is a management function that supports the top management. Public relations, which is a management function, offers support services to the management such as enabling them to know surroundings and to transfer the objectives of the organizations to the public and is a strategic process that includes research, planning, implementing and evaluating process. It requires close cooperating with senior management in decision making and implementation. Public relations' participation in management is important in terms of success of the organization. Participation in management is closely related to types the management. While some organizations encourage the public relations practitioners and the members of the organizations to participate in decision taking process, decisions are being taken in the top level management in some other organizations. In this study, which examines the management's impact on public relations practice in the framework of Weber's "Typology of Authority" and Likert's "Systems Approach", literature review method is used; it is concluded that rational - legal authority in the organizations is more appropriate administrator profile for public relations practice.

J	Courtemanche, L; Cote, L; Schiehll, E				Courtemanche, Line; Cote, Louise; Schiehll, Eduardo			Board capital and strategic turnaround: A longitudinal case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISCLOSURE AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						board capital; strategic turnaround; strategic levels; longitudinal; case study; archive-based approach		We conducted a 10-year (1997 - 2006) longitudinal case study of a publicly traded global transportation company (Bombardier Inc.) to examine the dynamic relationships between board capital, strategy and organizational environment. We find various links between four dimensions of board capital and changes at three strategic levels: institutional, corporate and business. Our findings indicate that Bombardier adjusted to the changing contingencies of the external environment by changing the resources provided by the Board of Directors - board human and relational capital - and by adopting specific strategies, which in turn further impacted board capital. Our study contributes to the corporate governance literature on board service tasks. We saw significant changes in board human and relational capital over the period of analysis, even though board independence remained constant. Our findings invite investors and policymakers to consider the requirements for an effective service task when nominating board members and developing board rules.

J	Ilter, HK				Ilter, H. Kemal			On the sub-optimality of strategic decisions	ISTANBUL UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF THE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS			Turkish	Article						Strategic Decision Making; Fitness Landscape Theory; Sub-Optimality; NK Landscape; Simulation	MODEL	Conceptual view of fitness and fitness measurement of strategic decisions on information systems, technological systems and innovation are becoming more important in recent years. This paper determines some dynamics of fitness landscape which lead to termination of decision makers' research before reaching the global maximum in strategic decisions. These dynamics are specified according to management decision making models and supported with simulation results. This article determines simulation results by means of "Fitness Value" and "Probability of Optimality". Correlation between these two concepts may be remarkable according to revealing optimal values in innovative and research-based decision making approaches beside sub-optimal results of traditional decision making approaches.

The Demography of Resources	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						divestiture; resource demography; resource management	DISK-DRIVE INDUSTRY; NICHE WIDTH; ORGANIZATIONAL DEMOGRAPHY; AUTOMOBILE PRODUCERS; FIRM PERFORMANCE; DIVESTMENT; DYNAMICS; DIVERSIFICATION; MORTALITY; EVOLUTION	A longitudinal event-history analysis using complete data on the aircraft fleets of all British airlines over the period 1919 to 1975 was applied to elucidating how a firm's internal resource demography can explain its resource divestiture decisions. The likelihood of divestiture for any particular aircraft was found to depend strongly on its age and size, but also on the age and size heterogeneity of an airline's entire fleet. The results constitute a demonstration of the utility of taking a demographic approach to studying the management of resource portfolios. This approach may also prove fruitful in the study of other types of strategic resources and their management.

Therefore, the research of the optimal IPO timing is of great practical significance. Under the framework of the real options model by Draho, this paper introduces the capital asset pricing model and two variables including online distribution costs and private benefits, making a static analysis on the model's result and conducting numerical and empirical simulations on China's A-share market stock data. Finally we arrive at the conclusion that the empirical test results, to a large extent, are consistent with the model's results, excepting the impact of market fluctuation on the waiting time. Based on the above analysis, this paper sums up a few defects of the primary market and gives the relevant policy recommendations.

But a primary concern of treasurers remains: How do you manage euro foreign exchange (FX) risk? So treasurers worry about the uncertainties: When and how will monetary policy be normalized? How will FX rates respond? And what information is needed to manage the accompanying FX risk prudently? The authors of this article help readers by providing benchmark data pertaining to euro FX risk management. They also explore the strategic implications of the data. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Image building can he achieved through various means such as books, films or images envisioned by the tourists themselves. The image of Santiago de Compostela, associated with the Way to Santiago (Camino de Santiago) and pilgrims, generates expectations and nostalgia that affect the authenticity of the destination in a positive manner. Generally speaking, authenticity is considered to be an antecedent of tourists' satisfaction and their future intentions. This study analyzes the impact of image in perceived authenticity and its role as a determinant of tourist loyalty. The empirical data were collected during the holy Year 2010 in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. A total of 400 questionnaires were returned and analyzed using structural equation modelling. The results indicate that the image of the destination has a direct impact on authenticity and loyalty. The study provides some strategic management suggestions for Santiago de Compostela and other World Heritage Cities.

Companies need support to succeed in software acquisition projects because such projects commonly present high failure rates. To solve this problem, it is necessary to design mechanisms for software acquisition, such as risk classification to identify the typical risks that may affect the success of a software acquisition project. Thus, herein, we present a case study, showing the implementation of a risk taxonomy whose structure is designed using a method for its construction, with a mechanism to reduce the risk of acquisition projects that adversely affect their success.

Particularly, overseas investment has been significantly increased with the development of international businesses after World War II. Individual technology and the experiences in management could expand the operation performance of an enterprise, which could also consider creating innovative opportunities in overseas markets to sustain the business. This study first explains the development of overseas investment and the planning considerations of high-tech industry in Taiwan and proceeds data analyses of the owners, Taiwanese managers, and employees in high-tech industry with questionnaire survey in order to discuss the key success factor in overseas investment of high-tech industry in Taiwan. Within the key success factor in overseas investment of high-tech industry in the second hierarchy, Political dimension is mostly emphasized, with the weight 0.436, about 43.6% of the overall weight, followed by Social (weight 0.313) and Economic (weight 0.251). The investigation results present Political being the mostly emphasized dimension for the overseas investment of high-tech industry.

In particular, we make use of a strategic market game with money where equilibria are standardly non-Walrasian, permitting an active role to monetary policy. The imposition of information costs alters the demand of real balances since traders demand extra money for gathering and processing the necessary information. As a result, money injections could be proved welfare improving only when the induced information costs do not offset the resulted gains to trade.

Lightning data are complex, momentary, discrete, dynamic and spatio-temporal in nature. Hence, making great progress in their management, analysis and service is challenging. Many studies have been directed towards this field all over the world. Some different relevant systems are currently available. However, most of them focus on a single or a few aspects of lightning applications, rather than taking an overall account of lightning detection, management, analysis and service from the strategic perspective of the digital earth. Lightning disaster also demands a better developed spatial information technology in this field than at present. The idea of the digital earth offers a reasonable scheme to address these issues. Based on reviews of the concept, development and progress of the digital earth, an integrated technical framework of a digital lightning prototype system (DLPS) is proposed, including its data, functions and implementation of subsystems, which aims at the facilitation, management, accessing, visualisation, application, release and sharing of lightning data. Some key technologies are also carefully discussed to facilitate the construction of the DLPS. This framework could provide a helpful guide to future lightning research and hazard mitigation, as well as enrich connotation on the digital earth. So far, there are still many difficulties in multi-level grid construction that need to be solved.

J	Chen, WS; Bennett, D				Chen, Wenshin; Bennett, David			Gaining social values of wireless technology: An interpretive case study in the healthcare institutional context	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Social value; Wireless technology; Healthcare institution; Interpretive case study	ELECTRONIC MEDICAL-RECORDS; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; POINT; ISOMORPHISM; PRESSURES; STRATEGY; TRANSFORMATION; ORGANIZATIONS; LEGITIMACY; POLITICS	The existing literature has given little consideration to social values of information technology in general or of wireless technology in particular. The purpose of this paper is thus to shed new light on this issue. Based on an interpretive case study, we examine two healthcare organisations and discover that social values are often manifested beyond, as well as within, organisations. A matrix of social values in relation to technology changes and their interactions with various stakeholders is further discussed. The matrix helps understand how various social values emerge from and revolve around organisations' strategic management of information technology. The implications of the findings about social values are discussed and future research directions are suggested. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ciasullo, MV; Monetta, G				Ciasullo, Maria Vincenza; Monetta, Giulia			A Renewed University Governance: Changes and Perspectives from the Italian Context	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE SERVICE SECTOR			English	Article						Academic Governance; Board Composition; Business Management; Higher Education; Italian Universities; Strategic Decision Making		During recent years radical changes have affected universities in most Western European countries, implying new pressures and demands on higher education systems and deeply influencing the context in which universities operate. The paper attempts to investigate governance issues and the need for new strategic paths emerging as a result of changed scenarios. Specifically, the greater number of stakeholders involved in academic activities requires universities to take into account a variety of social, economic and cultural factors when making strategic decisions. Adjustments in board composition through appointing non-academic members are signals of such trends. Moving from this consideration and relying on data on the governance structures of Italian universities, the paper discusses challenges for academic institutions in terms of change in their strategic management and governance structures as well as the likely directions such change is taking.

J	Dabrowski, M				Dabrowski, Marcin			Collaborative Web-Based System for Knowledge Transfer to Distributed Groups of Users Within Strategic Noise Mapping Domain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Chatterbot; E-learning; Information Communication Technologies (ICT); Knowledge Transfer; Noise Mapping; Semantic Search Engine; Web-Based Supporting System		The Environmental Noise Directive (Directive 2002/49/EC) obliged competent authorities to prepare strategic noise maps (SNM) and actions plans (AP) for the major roads, railways, airports and agglomerations with more than 100 000 inhabitants. Both SNM and AP have to be updated every five years, that is why procedures of creating, using and administrating of SNM and AP can be considered as constant processes. These processes are very complex and require specialized knowledge and practical skills within noise mapping area and connected with them proper experience of SNM usage and AP enforcement. Unfortunately as experience shows, Polish administrators of SNM are not competent enough to meet these requirements. The problem outlined above has become the basis to develop web- based system for knowledge transfer to SNM administrators, covering such key issues as: the preparation of guidelines for SAM, gathering the appropriate input data for acoustic model and the subsequent verification of developed SAM.

J	Kharuddin, S; Yau, FS; Senik, R				Kharuddin, Saira; Yau, Foong Soon; Senik, Rosmila			ERP Adoption Factors: The Effect of Institutional- and Economic-Based Theory	PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES			English	Article						IT adoption factors; economic-based theory; Enterprise Resource Planning; Information and Communications Technologies; institutional theory	SYSTEMS ADOPTION; INFORMATION; IMPLEMENTATION; EXPLANATIONS; ISOMORPHISM; TECHNOLOGY; FRAMEWORK; IMPACTS; SUCCESS	The introduction of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in the early 1990s was perceived as a new way of managing a business that could lead to better management of an organisation and improve its efficiency. However, studies have repeatedly reported a low success rate in ERP system adoption. This encouraged various research studies that sought to uncover factors that could have contributed to the system failure. A poor decision-making process has been stated as one of the main reasons for ERP system failure. Clear objectives and good justification could, we believe, increase the ERP system adoption success rate. Hence, in this study, we extend the existing research on ERP by exploring the effect of institutional pressures and economic benefits on the decision-making process of the management. Specifically, we investigate the influence of external pressures and internal needs in ERP adoption decisions. Empirical analyses in this study are based on survey data obtained from 136 Malaysian companies. Overall, our findings indicate that only operational benefits and mimetic pressure have significant influence on ERP system adoption decisions. Other economic benefits such as managerial benefits and strategic benefits have no significant impact on the management's decision to adopt the system. Similarly, institutional pressures, coercive pressures and normative pressures yield non-significant results. These results are important because the evidence highlights that the management's decision to adopt the ERP system is based on the felt need for the organisation to improve its operational efficiency, and the influence of mimetic pressures further accentuates the importance for the organization of being competitive in its technological capabilities.

J	Rao, TVSR				Rao, T. V. S. Ramamohan			Microeconomic Theory of Spinoff Decisions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						CES Function; Elasticity of Substitution; Innovations; New Product; SpinoffThe		The present study demonstrates that the product line choice of a firm depends on the elasticity of substitution between products (and the organizational and coordination requirements that it implies), the bargaining power of managers of different product divisions, and marketing prospects of each of the products. A new product idea, put forward by an employee, will be integrated if a combination of these features obtains. A spinoff will result if any one, or more, of these conditions is not satisfied. In general, it is shown that a new product, which has a high elasticity of substitution with the existing products, will experience a spinoff due to lack of organizational capabilities to integrate it while a product with a low elasticity will spinoff only due to the incumbent management's perception of low market potential and/or the strategic bargaining power of the incumbent management with respect to the existing product line.

J	Schutte, T				Schuette, Tino			INVESTMENT ADJUSTMENTS IN PRODUCT MARKET COMPETITION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						ABMS; product market competition; investment adjustments	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT	Situated in the research field of market structure and strategic behavior, a model is developed, which shows the impacts of investment adjustments on product market competition. Placed in a multi-firm multi-product setting, the consequences of decisions to split budgets in: (i) marketing and development activities and (ii) development expenditures into innovative or imitative activities is investigated. The model is validated with empirical data of the pharmaceutical industry, especially the drug market in Germany. An agent-based modeling and simulation approach is used to explain how the freedom of firms to adjust their investment according to an absolute (individual aspiration level) or relative comparison (success of competitors) can change market performance. The results show that investment strategies adjusted to the behavior of direct competitors outperforms adjustments based on individual aspiration levels.

A Collaborative Model of Information Technology Strategic Plan for the Government Sector	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Government; Information Technology (IT); Information Technology Strategic Plan (ITSP); Organization Management; Strategic Planning		Information Technology (IT) is strategic for organization management (Stair & Reynolds, 2005), although, many companies lack IT governance and planning, skilled people, defined and institutionalized methods and procedures, internal controls and indicators, and structures for agreement service levels and information security, legality, and economy. In this scenario, a minimum organization and control in the use of resources is needed to boost technical and administrative efficiency, with a focus on IT governance. An Information Technology Strategic Plan (ITSP) aims at discovering the resources and IT in an organization, to direct the technological and information architecture to its strategic objectives. The Brazilian Government issued a Normative Instruction (NI04) for public organizations to develop IT Strategic Plans so that they can purchase products and services. In order to help organizations develop, control and manage their ITSPs, a model was created that defines a set of auxiliary steps in the construction of the ITSP. Throughout this article we present an ITSP development and management model, its evaluation, and our conclusions.

J	Tsang, S				Tsang, Sandro			Knowledge Representation Strategy Determination in Quantitative Terms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Business Economics; Decision Theory; Information and Knowledge; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Representation Strategy; Organizational Behavior		Knowledge strategy is a critical component of knowledge management (KM) success. Surprisingly, a simple and quantifiable model of KM representation strategy does not seem to exist. This paper applies economics principles to derive a model for thinking of the decision problem in quantitative terms. The decision is about choosing the right codification-personalization split where all knowledge related resources are efficiently allocated to simultaneously support the business process or production. It shows that failing at making a diversified resource choice may conclude a suboptimal strategy (split). It seems to justify the propositions of an oft-cited paper and some published evidence. That is, a 50-50 split or a merely pure strategy can also be the optimal strategy. The model can be extended to include subjective decision factor, and be mastered easily. In future research, it may be developed into a game theoretical framework to capture the strategic and/or cooperative KM behaviors.

INTELLECTUAL RENT AS SOURCE AND RESULT OF INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENT	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						intellectual rent; patent monopoly; innovative development; profitability of branches		At the post-industrial stage of development of the society upon purposeful transition to an innovative way of development, intellectual activity becomes the basis of the new model of economy. It is accompanied by allocation of an intellectual resource as the basic strategic one. At present the condition of the theory and practice of rent relations is in the sphere of intellectual, innovative activity at the origin stage, the foundation is being laid: the conceptual and categorial framework is defined, intrinsic lines of intellectual rent come to light, options of assessment of rent are grounded. In the article research of rent relations in the sphere of intellectual, innovative activity is given. The study of evolution of the theory of rent showed that it developed together with complication and differentiation of types of economic activity, involvement in economic process of new types of resources. Taking into account that at the present historical stage there is a gradual all-system transformation of the social and economic relations, the theory of rent has further development connected with transfer of rent relations into the intellectual, innovative sphere. The concept "intellectual rent", its structure and features are described. The first part of intellectual rent is made by the excess profit received from production and realization of innovative production by one's own forces on the basis of objects of intellectual property. The second part of rent is made by the income from transfer of property rights (royalty, lump-sum payments, mixed payments). The basis of formation of intellectual rent is intellectual property. Fundamental differences of patent monopoly and traditional monopoly are specified. The creative role of intellectual rent and patent monopoly in technological progress stimulation, development of human capital, formation of a new model of economy is proved. According to the authors, questions of interaction of anti-trust and protection of intellectual property are most urgent for the developed countries with a competitive hi-tech sector, in which there are giant companies rather rigidly competing and often using noncompetitive methods. In case with developing countries, in particular, with Russia characterized by insufficient innovative activity of companies, with a weak hi-tech sector and mainly small and medium-sized companies functioning, strengthening of intellectual property protection and better efficiency of mechanisms of coercion to legislation performance are necessary. On the basis of the data of researches on profitability of branches a conclusion is drawn that economy of Russia has essential disproportions in profitability level in favor of branches of low repartition. In Russia there mainly develop those types of productions of goods and services that are capable to provide profitability at the level considerably exceeding the average one for world economy. The innovative sector remains underfunded, in this regard the need of purposeful formation of intellectual rent at various levels of economy is proved. The task is that the country and regions do not lose the due share of the world intellectual rent at the intellectual potential and natural and resource support it has. The need of management of the process of formation of innovative income depending on the regional model of innovative development is stated.

Its elements are worker, working space, equipment and machinery. Creating a workplace requires good preparation. There are optimal workplace organization rules that help during the creation process. Technical and technological knowledge is applied when designing a workplace. We get answers on some very important issues by analysing the workplace, and thus we get the description and requirements of the workplace. The analysis is carried out in several ways - by observing, conducting interviews, filling out questionnaires, group discussions, or keeping a journal. In that way we get a basis for determining the amount of wages, adequate worker for a particular job, etc.	[Buntak, Kresimir; Sesar, Vesna] Veleuciliste Varazdinu, Varazhdin, Croatia		Buntak, K (corresponding author), Veleuciliste Varazdinu, Varazhdin, Croatia.	kresimir.buntak@velv.hr; vesna.sesar@velv.hr	Buntak, Kresimir/F-1353-2015; Sesar, Vesna/AAK-9306-2021	Buntak, Kresimir/0000-0002-2209-690X; 			Desic V., 1974, ORG EKONOMIKA PROIZV; First Rogale S., 2007, OBLIKOVANJE RADNIH M; Gojanovic J., 1977, EKONOMIKA ORG PROIZV; Kondic Z., 2013, PREDAVANJA RADNO MJE; Poljak T., PSIHOLOGIJA RADA SEM; Pupavac D., 2013, FUNKCIJE ODJELA LJUD; Taborsak D., 1966, STUDIJ RADA	7	0	0	0	2	UNIV NORTH	VARAZDIN	SVEUCILISNI CENTAR VARAZDIN, 104 BRIGADE 3, VARAZDIN, 42000, CROATIA	1846-6168	1848-5588		TEH GLAS	Teh.

PROJECT CONTROL SYSTEM CREATION WITH HEURISTIC METHODS IN AN ORGANIZATION	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						project; heuristic methods; business		Modern systems of business need flexibility in management. It means that modern systems of business have demand in the instruments such as projects and people who can manage project teams. Flexibility in management bears creative thought. A successful project depends on the project manager who can solve creative problems. Talents of the project manager to find creative decisions influence positively on the life of the project. The project is a plan, so it can include consistent and parallel operations, which always give a final product. The final product of the project is a unique result. Evidently, a unique result is the outcome of creative and intelligence work of all the project team. With unreasonable or unsystematized management and control framework the realization of many projects will necessarily lead to wrong resource distribution. Examples are prolonged projects, which create irrelevant and out-of-date products. One of the variants of problem solving is making a uniform control system integrating all business processes. To solve this problem the staff of the planning department developed a control system, which carries out correlation analysis of present-day problems and strategy of the organization. It required a control system because of numerous projects implemented simultaneously. The planning department worked out a plan of actions that included consecutive stages to create a complex program of organization development, the knowledge base for the staff of the department of strategic planning and design.

Then, sampling kit was designed by disposable syringe, 0.45um syringe filter, and 2mL plastic vial. 13 water samples were collected from oxidation pond and natural stream in a University campus. Four analytical modes were applied for standard solutions and the environmental samples. The detection limit (S/N =3) in mu M/L were as follows, SO42- (0.31), Cl- (0.50), NO3- (0.89), Na+ (0.52), NH4+ (0.94), K+ (1.24), Mg2+ (0.76), Ca2+ (1.75), NO2- (0.02), and PO43- (0.12), and its EC was 0.03 mu S/cm. Our analytical approach was simple, rapid, low-cost, and multi-parameter that was satisfactory to assess the water samples. Due to the sampling, transportation, storage processes are drastically improved, our approach has potential to contribute to strategic environmental assessment.

J	Nicita, A				Nicita, Antonio			Managing Strategically Outside Options under Incomplete Contracts	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRY COMPETITION & TRADE			English	Article						incomplete contracts; hold-up problem; strategic behavior; endogenous outside options; cross competition; vertical integration		This paper studies an incomplete contract framework in which specific investments affect parties' outside options. We show that the 'direction' of standard hold-up in this new framework strictly depends on the impact generated by investments on ex-post parties' outside options. This conclusion reverses some of the main results raised by the standard literature on incomplete contracts. Under given conditions, parties may even over-invest in assets specificity, as the changes induced in outside options improve their ex-post bargaining power. We discuss the implications for competition policy and for the management of incomplete contracts.

Two multinational giants C-A and C-B are studied, where C-A uses the processes of exploitation and exploration within the same unit while C-B performs ambidexterity in specific and separate departments. Strategic decision making processes, strategic flexibility, incentive system and leadership styles are studied. The results show that both the companies are very high in rationality and non-monetary incentives are given more importance than monetary incentives in both. Whereas, the study also shows that C-A is higher in interactive control systems and participative leadership than C-B; This research also shows that C-A is highly interactive in nature while C-B is low in interaction, C-B is bolder than C-A w.r.t. decision making; managerial flexibility is higher in C-A than in C-B and lastly, the result shows that CA is more participative and people oriented while C-B is more directive and task oriented in nature.

The plan is part of the wider system of actions taken by the Municipality to achieve the objectives on the environment posed by the European Union with the Directive "EP seals climate change package 20-20-20". In particular the planning tool provides a series of actions aimed at containing the energy consumption through measures to rationalize, do not waste and reduce the use of non-renewable resources, by promoting "best practices" from the management of public assets, the use of innovative technologies in all sectors and activities; the diffusion of renewable energy production, with care to avoid impacts and interference with the historical landscape, including the promotion of programs and interventions of public management. The different strategic projects will take care of specific actions also for the experimental use of innovative technologies. The article proposes, within the framework of strategies and actions at the European level for small municipalities, the example of the City of Agropoli drawing conclusions and reflections on the issue of energy saving relative to the housing stock.

A number of components, which form the basis for such a system, included the dilution factor for radioactive liquid effluent releases. In this study we established a strategic, fast and cheap methodology to estimate the dilution factor for the release of liquid radioactive effluents at IPEN. The radioisotopes H-3, Mn-54, Co-60, Zn-65, and Cs-137, generated in the routine operation of the Research Reactor IEA-R1, were used as radiotracers. The generated liquid radioactive effluent was stored in a 300 m(3) capacity tank. The initial concentration of its present radioisotopes were determined. A planned release of effluent from the storage tank was carried-out. Simultaneously, the sampling was made upstream of the storage tank discharge point and the concentration H-3, Mn-54, Co-60, Zn-65 and Cs-137 in the mix sewerage system discharge point E1 at IPEN were monitored. The estimated dilution factor of discharge point of the aqueous effluent for H-3 was 4.3 and 7.4, Mn-54 was12 and 16.1, Co-60 was 12.6 and 14.2, Zn-65 was 12 and 27.9 and Cs-137 was 6.2 and 13.9, respectively.

J	Shen, J; Zheng, WY; Wang, J; Zheng, YH; Mei, Y				Shen, Jian; Zheng, Wenying; Wang, Jin; Zheng, Yuhui; Mei, Yuan			An Improved Buffer Scheme in Delay Tolerant Networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FUTURE GENERATION COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Delay tolerant networks; buffer scheme; received signal strength indicator		Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are a class of emerging networks where disconnections may occur frequently due to propagation phenomena, node mobility, and power outages. Delay is inevitable in DTNs, thus, making better use of buffer space to maximize the packet delivery rate is more important than concentrating on how to decrease the delay. In this paper, we improve the buffer scheme of Epidemic Routing, which is a well-known routing protocol in DTNs. Epidemic Routing utilizes the FIFO buffer management scheme to manage the queuing. However, Epidemic Routing is still very sensitive to the buffer size. Epidemic Routing, furthermore, can only achieve good performance with respect to infinite buffer size due to that a node may have enough space to store lots of messages in its buffer and carry them along for long periods of times until appropriate forwarding opportunities arise. Once there is not enough buffer size, then the performance of Epidemic Routing will fall down hastily. We propose a new buffer scheme in Epidemic Routing, named Location and Direction Aware Drop Scheme (LDDS). LDDS utilizes the location and moving direction information of nodes to determine the drop sequence. A node can get the location and moving direction information of other nodes by receiving beacon packets periodically from anchor nodes and referring to received signal strength indicator (RSSI) for the beacon. In particular, LDDS is able to guarantee the high packet delivery ratio under small buffer size.

Corporate use of environmental information systems gained several benefits in the global and local markets. Nevertheless, there was no documentation to explain the extent to which corporate organizations utilize available environmental information systems in Tanzania. This study used purposive sampling with informants being workers from the strategic, tactical and control functions of the corporate organization. Moreover, data collection involved survey of 50 corporate organizations in Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Moshi and Morogoro councils, with 71 respondents. The collected data includes exploration of the extent to which corporate management functions utilize available environmental information systems in Tanzania. The study identified various corporate environmental management functions performed at all levels of the corporate organization, in which workers spends less than one hour on the environmental information systems available. The results also revealed that, there is adequate utilization of available environmental information systems for environmental management. Therefore, the research outcomes provides inputs to corporate organization unit managers, corporate owners and other environmental stakeholders on the extent of the systems' use as well as sharing experience on different environmental management systems used worldwide.

J	Parthasarathy, VR				Parthasarathy, V. R. (Perry)			Managing uncertainty: A case for using real options with option pricing model (OPM) to evaluate capital investment	TAPPI JOURNAL			English	Article							PORTFOLIO	The pulp and paper industry relies heavily on the traditional discounted cash flow-based net present value (DCF-NPV) for making capital investment decisions. The deficiency of the DCF-NPV model is that it is static; once a pattern of cash flow is established, management does not have the option to change the direction when new information is available. However, flexibility to alter the investment decision is a powerful strategic and capital investment tool. Abundant research has established strong precedence for applications of "real options" in operational and strategic settings to provide useful insights in the evaluation of irreversible investments under uncertainty. The binomial or Black-Scholes option pricing model (OPM) for strategic planning and capital investment has been used in many other industries but not in the pulp and paper industry. The pulp and paper industry, though very capital intensive, has provided poor to moderate return on investment or return on capital and has never used the OPM and the flexibility it offers for capital investment decisions. This paper makes a case for using OPM for capital investment decisions by using the example of a hypothetical North American mill considering investments to modernize its papermaking operation.

Isolation and characterization of microsatellite loci for Stys's bush-cricket, Isophya stysi, and cross-species amplification in closely related species from the Phaneropteridae family	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						Orthoptera; polymorphic; population genetics	ORTHOPTERA; MORPHOLOGY; VONWATTENWYL,BRUNNER; TETTIGONIIDAE	Ten microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized for Stys's bush-cricket, Isophya stysi Cejchan (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae), an endemic Orthoptera species to the Carpathian Basin, using an enriched genomic library procedure. The polymorphism of these loci were tested in two populations of I. stysi, and the number of alleles per locus varied from 4 to 16. The expected and observed heterozygosities ranged from 0.612 to 0.925 and from 0.625 to 1.000, respectively. The interspecific applicability of these microsatellites was evaluated by amplification in 20 related species: Isophya camptoxypha, Isophya sicula, Isophya ciucasi, Isophya pienensis, Isophya harzi, Isophya kraussii, Isophya zubovskii, Isophya rectipennis, Isophya modesta, Isophya longicaudata, Isophya dobrogensis, Isophya hospodar, Isophya speciosa, Isophya modestior, Poecilimon fussii, Poecilimon affinis, Polysarcus denticauda, Barbitistes constrictus, Leptophyes discoidalis, Phaneroptera falcata. All primer pairs for the 10 loci yielded successful amplifications in at least one other taxon from the Isophya genus. This set of microsatellite loci would be useful for genetic studies in I. stysi and other species of the genus Isophya.

J	Al-Fayez, FT				Al-Fayez, Fares Thaher			The Turkish Strategic Restrictions towards the Arab Revolts (2011 - 2012)	JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW			English	Article								Turkey is distinguished with property of elements of enough power, which makes it a regional power: the location, the area, the population, and the strong economy. The creed, identity, skills and natural resources, all these factors assist Turkey to prove its domination and power in a rising shape, but its strategic concept did not appear before the present Turkish government comes in 2002 and may be, because of the dispersion of power elements in the state. The Turkish policies at that stage could be described in confronting internal, regional and international issues. It is a policy of running the variety, or (management of diversity) and from the other side, (policy of crises management). Turkey witnesses ever since discussions about the significance of the concealed true power of Turkey in the field of its international relations, and to which extent it invests them in its diplomatic relations. These discussions amount between two trends; one attempts to found legitimacy of the concept of Turkey to remain mortgaged to the connected policies with centers of powers formed outside. That is by showing Turkey's level of concealed power less than level, which it should be on, through frozen operations of evaluation connected with stage situations. The second is a trend presenting excessive optimistic estimations, mortgaging that Turkey can explode its power strictly, without new analysis and dynamic to the elements of the changing and static power which Turkey owns in the shadow of the new international situation. Ankara sticked to neutrality at the beginning of the Arab incidents towards the Tunisian Revolt in December 2010. But with the hasting of incidents in Egypt after one month from that date Ardoghan initiated by calling former president Husni Mobarak to withdraw, and Abdullah Ghoul was the first president to visit Egypt after the collapse of Mobarak, the thing that duplicated the popularity that Turkey obtains on the Egyptian sphere, and it is what was reflected in receiving Ardoghan at his visit to Egypt in September, 2011. He paid a visit heading a big delegation of businessmen. This assured Turkey's desire to enlarge its economic relation with the biggest Arab state. At the start of the Libyan Revolt in February 2011, Turkey hesitated to act. Turkey had big investments with Al-Quaddafi's regime. Therefore, it assured this significance to reach a political settlement of the Libyan crisis, at the beginning of incidents, fore-warning from seriousness of fighting like that which happened in Iraq before, the thing that harmed Turkey's picture inside Libya. But after passing the resolution of the Security Council 1973, which allowed forcing an area of air-navigation prohibition over Libya, Ankara's stand was changed by sending sea-forces to participate in the NATO operations there, beside the participation in the human aid efforts. Also, the break- out of Bahrain Revolt in February 2011 placed Turkey among numerous accounts. Turkey had large economic interests with states of the Gulf Cooperative Council, and had to respect the security specialty of Gulf region, and it did not wish to encourage Iran to interfere in the Gulf affairs. Though, Ankara wanted to rise its diplomatic role in an attempt to quiet the Shia't-Sunni tensions in the region, that harm its special interests. Ankara presented mediation.

THE ROLE OF EPISTEMOLOGICAL APPROACH IN MANAGEMENT THEORIES FORMATION	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE			Russian	Article						knowledge management; rationalism; empiricism; scientific management; human relations theory; explicit and tacit knowledge; dynamic knowledge creation model		The article presents an attempt to relate differences in approaches to epistemology to the major differences between the existing management theories. The topicality of establishing this relation arises from the fact that the origination of a modern management theory called Knowledge Management, which is grounded on the idea that knowledge is the main strategic resource of any organization, resulted from the development of different views on management. Therefore understanding this relation would bring it to light how managers' views on knowledge were formed and would allow interconnections and discrepancies between different papers on Knowledge Management to be seen more clearly.

Funding changes from the Singapore government were the primary cause of Hospice Care Association's (HCA) critical financial situation. Additionally, staffing response to changes in operations was severe and negative. Dr. Akhileswaran is thrust into a position of leadership that initially overwhelms and surprises him, given that his expected role - and the role he had agreed to take on - was that of Medical Director. The urgent need for the organization was strategic leadership, without which it is very likely that HCA would not be able to sustain its mission, and would have to close its doors. That outcome would result in patients not being treated in their final year of life; something Dr. Akhileswaran was not able to accept as Medical Director. The relevance and difficulty of achieving a nonprofit mission, and the need for strategy and strategic leadership were key elements in this situation.

INTERACTION OF THE STATE AND EDUCATIONAL STRUCTURES IN THE FIELD OF MANAGEMENT OF A TARGET SET IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE			Russian	Article						target set; education; effective management		The target set in higher educational institutions represents the elaborate process which participants are customers of education, performers and being trained. The organization of a target set is included into area of interests of managers of higher educational institutions and managers of public authorities and local government. In the field of this interaction there is a number of the unresolved problems connected with preparation of curricula, comparison of interests and vectors of development of branches and HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS and much other. Effective management of a target set, is urged to solve a number of questions, annually arising at the organization of a competitive set and further training of future experts. Management of a target set at a development stage represents bilateral cooperation. The educational institution for its part develops educational plans, and the public institutions long-term and medium-term plans of work including a set of employees on certain workplaces, according to developed programs of development. Comparison of curricula and development plans of establishment is made at a stage of the decision on quantity of target places for certain directions. Competences which the graduate has to possess, have to master the requirements shown by the employer. And it is necessary to put in advance in competence curricula, perspective after 4-6 summer terms. It mentions areas of strategic planning in which management represents decision-making in not set, and only predicted conditions. Dynamics of development of modern society, puts in the forefront the functions of the management connected with forecasting and a choice of a way of development on the basis of built forecasts. Management within the set static conditions, the initial management of the current processes otherly than management within changing conditions. In relation to education institute, specifics of decision-making by management structure, dictates need for the organization of work of the research groups working in the field of forecasting. This requirement is expressed in assignment to higher educational institutions of the status "scientifically research" within the walls of which science and education merge is carried out. Management of educational structure, in relation to the state order for target training, has to coordinate results of the activity on development of training programs, being included in the market relations with other social institutes, thus without receding from the general mission of university which Jose Ortega-i-Gasset formulated as: "teaching of the main cultural and significant disciplines".

J	Mendonca, PR; Casas, ALL				Mendonca, Paulo Renato; Las Casas, Alexandre Luzzi			Diversification as a Sustainable Growth Strategy in the Packaging Market: case study of a Brazilian company, Impacta S/A Industria e Comercio	RISUS-JOURNAL ON INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						diversification; sustainability; business strategy		The diversification strategy is one of the most preferred by companies that search for the sustainable growth of their sales and profits in markets where products appear, grow in demand and become mature in a progressively faster way. This process is strongly perceived in the packaging product market, as packaging are means of product promotion, brand image building and product quality protection, currently more and more important for consumer products. This research aims to verify if the diversifying strategy is a suitable option for companies of such segment. The verification is performed through a case study covering the diversification solution of Impacta S/A, traditional supplier of aluminum collapsible tubes in Brazil and Latin America that added to its portfolio plastic tubes and aluminum monoblock aerosol cans. The conclusion of this study is that such diversification reached its goals of generating sustainable growth, reduce business risk, obtain solid "Market Share" in Brazil for all its products, adequately re-position the company in the market and surpass the results achieved by its competitors in the country. It was also possible to assess the perspective of continuity of the current strategy as a way to increase sales by 85% in US dollars in the next five years, confirming the good quality of the company managers' strategic choice. As this conclusion is in part limited by the fact that the study focused on a single case, a suggestion should be left recommending the analysis of other diversification cases of companies in the packaging segments.

For this, we performed a systematic mapping, following the structure proposed by Kitchenham and Charters (2007), to collect and identify this information. This mapping initially identified 2,013 studies, of which 26 were selected as primary studies, enabling tools and techniques to extract 36 and 13 main results obtained from the use of them. This amount of tools and techniques obtained from this mapping can be considered very relevant, allowing inferences about the importance of using the internet for the implementation of the strategic planning of IS / IT.

J	Boris, IB				Boris, Bezzubko, I			STRATEGIC URBAN PLANNING IN THE SYSTEM OF REGIONAL AND NATIONAL PLANNING OF UKRAINE	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						strategic planning; city; region; state		Strategic planning of the city received a large development in Ukraine. An important problem is the lack of coordination of strategic documents in the state, regions and cities. The article contains proposals for the harmonization of strategic planning at all levels of government: 1. Creation of a single integrated system of coordination on strategic documents. Of great importance in this process is the development of the concept of coordination of interests of local and regional authorities. 2. Efficient allocation of administrative functions, powers between the region and the local authorities. The paper identified the advantages and disadvantages of various options of relations in the core functions between the region and the city. 3. Determination of regional interests and their comparison with interests of cities in order to ensure effective implementation of policies and programs. There is a need to establish an effective relationship between the objectives of the region and the city. In the development of strategic documents it is important to consider their hierarchy. Strategy is a blueprint for future development or changes, adjustments of the following documents: - the Master Plan for the city, land use and development, general scheme of water supply, drainage, heating, transport, sanitation area; - a comprehensive program of engineering infrastructure; - a medium-term program and the outlook for economic and social development of the city, which will be determined by flow rates of state, regional and municipal budgets for the projects, which will last more than one year; - state projects and programs financed solely from the state budget; - the concept of sustainable economic and social development of the city; - investment programs and projects for the development of the city, requiring the creation of a public-private partnership (partnership of the local government with private capital); - capital investment plans, projects and programs financed from the budget of the city, as well as long-term program for the development of the target; - annual programs and plans for socio-economic development; - investment program and investment projects to be implemented in the city. The paper proposes a coordination system of strategic documents, the model of development of strategic documents. There is a need to introduce a system of agreements between regional and local authorities, local self-government, to develop a system of cooperation between municipalities on issues of strategic planning.

However, the closed model no longer meets the needs of managers. From this premise is that it is the emerging model of Open Innovation, technique of open space for stakeholders to participate in the innovation process contributing ideas and suggestions. This paper presents the case of the Jornal A Noticia Regional Ltda, of Joao Monlevade city (MG), which is facing the challenge to innovate to enhance your product. For this, were tested collaboration platforms such as social network Facebook, as well as promoted a focus group and analyzed three newspapers of expression in Brazil. Among the observed results, we highlight the use of Open Innovation as adequate to support Innovation Management company, which should promote changes like inserting more columns of opinion and convergence printed with digital media.

J	Yelena, SA				Yelena, Anokhina S.			IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEMS OF CHINA'S LABOR EXPORT POLICY	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						China; labor export; labor migration		The paper is devoted to the analysis of China's labor export policy. It describes the size, structure, geography of Chinese labor migration, outlines main problems of implementation of China's labor export policy and measures taken by Chinese government to eliminate the problems, and researches labor export impact upon China's economic and social development. Labor export is one of the strategic areas of China's foreign economic policy. Development of labor export and labor migration was linked with country development trends and necessity to meet economic challenges. Since introducing reforms and ''open door'' policy Chinese government has changed its approach to foreign policy and foreign economic cooperation. A primary importance was assigned to modernization of the country and handling domestic problems. New approaches were applied to labor export as it became an important source of country's revenue. Chinese government uses a wide range of measures for support and promotion of labor export in China and abroad. Labor export enabled Chinese government to solve some domestic problems and became an effective mechanism to reduce pressure in domestic labor market. China increases capacity and expands channels of labor export. Annually China increases the total value of labor export contracts and expands export geography. In spite of the great strides made by China in labor export since introducing reforms and '' open door'' policy, China's labor export capacity is far from its peak and has a huge potential for its development. Unfulfilled labor export capacity is caused by several reasons including management problems and incomplete sectoral legislation. Administration system is undeveloped, the labor export laws in force do not fit the times and current trends of labor export growth. Other factors apart from the low level of proficiency in foreign languages by Chinese workers, insufficient qualification of Chinese workers, lack of knowledge of basic international standards and sectoral requirements, low level of pretraining of Chinese workers before they go abroad limit a lot China's capability to increase labor export. Among other problems there are protection of Chinese workers abroad, quotas imposed by importers of Chinese labor force, high requirements for obtaining working visas by Chinese citizens, non-recognition of Chinese diplomas abroad. China needs to improve its labor export administration system and eliminate legislation shortcomings in order to expand its labor export.

There has been a huge growth in the field of information technology. Traditionally IT was used only to provide the back office support to organizations. Nowadays it plays a strategic role in organizations supporting many business functions and also shapes new strategies in organizations. The IT field has also been introduced in the field of governance called "E Governance". This IT based E governance has also been introduced in the field of education. The implementation of e governance in education has led to new broader innovations. E governance has enabled universities to expand their current geographical reach, to interact to prospective students all around the world and to establish themselves as global education providers. This paper examines the need for implementation of e governance in education sector and its possible advantages. The paper also proposes a framework to measure the success of an e governance initiative in an educational organisation. The aim of this paper is to examine the nature of change in Education with respect to the introduction and growth of IT based e governance.

This is defined mainly by the specific information and communication technology (ICT) enabled by Internet/Extranet/Intranet. The ICT tools functionalities have been developed to better satisfy virtual teams requirements related to knowledge management activities. In this context, this article presents a brief state- of- the- art of virtual teams' definitions and characteristics that reinforce them with efficiencyeffectiveness. Foreword, because of the large variety of ICT tools available to support virtual collaboration, the authors proposed an approach for the decision making process of choosing the adequate software solution based on the particular needs and requirement determined by the collaborative environment specificity. Assisting this, there will be analyzed the specific software tool's main functionalities that are correlated with the virtual teams requirements. This is the main step for the decision making process approach definition in order to choose the adequate software solution, using ELECTRE method (decision under conditions of certainty).

SYSTEM OF INTEGRAL INDICATORS OF EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN OF COMPANY	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						organisational structure of management; diagnostic of efficiency of organisational management structure; organisational design; organisational pathology		Researches on organizational design single out the following criteria, which characterise the efficiency and effectiveness of management process organisation and organisational management structure (OMS): labour efficiency of a management subject; economic efficiency; adaptivity and flexibility; reliability; promptness of making managerial decisions, and others. The environmental changes response rate is an actual factor of OMS efficiency in dynamic conditions. The OMS effectiveness measurement should be considered as an element of controlling, which provides the assessment of product and process quality, profitability, resource intensity, tempo and scale of innovations, customers' satisfaction degree (loyalty), autonomy, efficiency, and others. The principal condition when assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of organizational design is the integration of formalized structural, situational and context parameters, their assessment in the conditions of a high level of external environment changeability, change of strategic goals and the path, which an organization chooses to reach these goals. The pre-design of OMS is based on singling out the factors that determine the dynamics of external and internal environment: technologies, knowledge and management and employees' competencies; the degree of complexity of the OMS in use, which is determined by the complexity of interrelations of the organizational system with the interested parties, as well as the scale of activity; way of power execution and other parameters of organizational behaviour. The effectiveness of organisational design is provided as an additive function of such indicators as: - the degree of rationality of organisational system structuring as a characteristic of correspondence of organisational system structuring and objective functions; - the degree of rationality of formalised interrelations between the elements of a structure as a characteristic of rationality of system structuring (considering the peculiarities of technologies, outsourcing opportunities, convergence of competencies) and its ability to solve a stream of adhocratic tasks within a formalised structure; - the degree of market opportunities use by the organisational system as a characteristic of using market opportunities, the ability to provide a necessary level of competitiveness in the conditions of a high level of external environment uncertainty; - the degree of use by the organisational system of internal opportunities such as a characteristic of its ability to realise the strategy by means of formation of a model adequate to strategic goals of organisational design in the conditions of all kinds of resources limitation.

Critical Factors Affecting Effective Management of Site Personnel and Operatives in Confined Site Construction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Brownfield/Brown Site Development; Confined Site Construction; Modern Construction Management Techniques; Personnel Management; Strategic Management; Urban Development	FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES; DYNAMIC LAYOUT; WORK; SAFETY	The aim of this paper is to identify and classify the numerous managerial issues encountered in the management of personnel in confined site construction. For the purpose of this research, a confined construction site is defined as a site where permanent works fit the site footprint, extending to levels above and/or below ground level, leaving spatial restrictions for other operations(e.g. plant and material movements, materials storage and temporary accommodation etc.) and require effective resource co-ordination beyond normal on-site management input. A literature review and analysis, case studies incorporating interviews and focus groups, and a questionnaire survey were used in order to gain a comprehensive insight into the issues of management of personnel in a confined construction site environment. The following are the top five leading issues highlighted; (1) Accidents due to an untidy site, (2) One contractor holding up another because of the lack of space, (3) A risk to personnel because of vehicular traffic on-site, (4) Difficult to facilitate several contractors at one work location, and (5) Numerous personnel working within the one space. In today's modern environment, spatial restrictions are quickly becoming the norm in the industry. Therefore, the management of personnel on-site becomes progressively more difficult with the decrease in available space on-site. Where such environments exist, acknowledging the numerous issues highlighted above, aids site management in the supervision and co-ordination of personnel on-site, thus reducing accidents, increasing productivity and increasing profit margins. As on-site management professionals successfully identify, acknowledge and counteract the numerous issues illustrated, the successful management of personnel on a confined construction site is achievable. By identifying the numerous issues, on-site management can proactively mitigate such issues through adopting counteractive measures and through successful identification of the traits identified.

The mathematical analysis aims to determine optimal behaviour of the inspectee. In this paper, the controller's (inspector) job is to audit a planner's (inspectee) decision with regard to its optimality and to submit a report to the company's top managers. Based on Fandel and Trockel (Int J Prod Econ 133:256-261, 2011) this inspection game is discussed here as an infinite two-person game under the aspect of costs minimization. The results show that a higher costs deviation because of a competitive behaviour of the strategic players will decrease their payoffs, so that the optimal cooperative behaviour will finally lead to a better solution for the company with respect to cost minimization as normally expected.

Elements Promoting Learning from a Strategic Partner: A Malaysian Case	PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES			English	Article						Strategic partner; organisational learning	JOINT VENTURES; ALLIANCES; COMPETITION; COMPETENCE; ADVANTAGE; KNOWLEDGE	Strategic alliances (SAs) are becoming a popular and prominent strategy to help many firms sustain its competitive advantage in the rapid and unexpected global economy. This inter-organisational structure is becoming essential feature in today's intensely competitive market as a means for facilitating market entry, acquiring new technology, leveraging economies of scale, and enhancing new product development capabilities. Additionally, in the recent trends of strategic alliance literature, they have been linked to the organisational learning literature where alliances create environments for learning and knowledge transfer. This phenomenon is referred to as 'alliance-based learning'. The main purpose of this paper is to discuss how learning can be promoted via alliance arrangement. The study used an in-depth case study method, where a child business was set up upon the signing of strategic alliance agreement between parent partner in Malaysia with foreign parent partner from the UK, and the partnership had included learning as one of their main objectives.

Strategizing Systematic HIV Intervention: A Case Study	JOURNAL OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article						HIV; AIDS; STI; RTI; sex workers		For any intervention in public health, one needs to gather the evidence on the basis of which systematic plans and strategies can be built. In Rajasthan, for HIV and AIDS prevention, care and support activities apex organisation is Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS). IIHMR, Jaipur, provided technical support to RSACS in targeted interventions, capacity building, strategic planning and public private partnership. In systematising the intervention with the sex workers living in district Sawai Madhopur, a situational analysis was carried out. The district is internationally known tourist place in Rajasthan and has remarkable mobility pattern among sex workers. It was found that in the district, the risk and vulnerabilities of sex workers has increased because of this mobility and illiteracy. It was reported that majority of sex workers in Sawai Madhopur knew that AIDS is not curable and the rest had either no idea or they thought AIDS could be cured. Amongst those who reported that they had no idea about the cure of HIV/AIDS, most of them were active sex workers. These active sex workers, hence, due to lack of awareness about STI, HIV and AIDS, were very vulnerable against HIV infection. Majority of the sex workers reported that they were not willing to use female condoms. Nearly half of the sex workers in Sawai Madhopur joined this profession as tradition of their families and caste. For HIV prevention and BCC, the better strategy is to use such IEC materials which contains pictures on various issues like condom negotiation, managing violence, sex workers collectives, correct and consistent use of condoms, STI, RTI, HIV and AIDS. Efforts should also be made to integrate the children from sex workers family into formal education process and, simultaneously, a little older children should be imparted skills in alternative trainings for joining other acceptable means of earning livelihood.

J	Natoliy, VM; Irina, AR				Natoliy, Manankov V.; Irina, Rakhmanova A.			CONCEPTUAL PHASE OF LIFE CYCLE OF INNOVATION MATERIAL - SYNTHETIC WOLLASTONITE	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						innovation; stages of innovation life cycle; synthetic wollastonite; industrial wastes		For achievement of modern technological level of economy development in our country the priority has to be given to development on the basis of innovations. This strategy results from the analysis of the long waves theory in national economy. At this stage development and realization of mechanisms of new knowledge transformation in high technologies and further to mass production is being predicted. According to it, modern postindustrial stage differs from the previous one by base creation for national innovative system (NIS) development, and according to the logic it is necessary to call it "innovative economy". For different innovations the structure of the first phase of the life cycle of an innovation varies due to the stages number necessary for determination of innovation advantages. For the innovation characteristic economists identify the first phase of the life cycle as a stage of strategic marketing, which is important for a more exact determination of market demand for these goods. However, many aspects of innovative management at this stage remain variable. Considering the strategic concepts of management and proceeding from our experience, we suggest a new phase to be called the conceptual phase of the life cycle of knowledge-intensive materials with allocation of four logically connected stages: 1) strategic marketing of an innovation, 2) basic researches, 3) scientifically-applied researches, 4) developmental projects. In the concept realization of sustainable development problems of complex waste-free use of natural resources and involvement of industrial wastes in environmentally friendly innovative technologies become topical. The amount of technogenic industrial wastes has been growing for the last hundred years. Annually the world forms over 25 billion tons of solid technogenic waste solely. About a third part of it -more than 7 billion tons -is produced in Russia. One of the perspective directions of innovative process is the full processing of industrial wastes including extraction from them of non-ferrous, rare and other metals, and creation of construction and constructional materials with high operational properties instead of natural, traditional materials and metals. Realization of this strategy will allow to reduce the consumption of primary natural resources significantly. Development of new high technology production of a number of important minerals in the practical relation and materials is an original revolution in mineralogy and materials science. Wollastonite is a mineral of high demand in leading industries. The British society on studying ceramics declared that '' if cheap synthetic wollastonite appears in the near future ''wollastonite era'' will come''. Research Laboratory of Cybernetics and Mineral Formation and Crystal Physics of Tomsk State University has offered a new approach to studying the problems of structuring a substance-holographic model, which allowed us to propose a number of forecasting schemes revealing the mechanisms of natural and technical mineral genesis, including in relation to new methods and technologies for the production of wollastonite and other silicates with promising properties. Competitiveness of synthetic wollastonite, expanding the scope in the local market through a number of advantages over the natural wollastonite and other materials used in the construction industry has been shown ( asbestos, talc).

J	Samartzi, V				Samartzi, Vasiliki			Account-sharing: a legitimate alternative to unlawful circumvention for the purposes of achieving content portability?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						account-sharing; content portability; anti-circumvention legislation; self-help circumvention; enforcement of copyright; exceptions; digital rights management		This article discusses the issue of content portability by providing copies to others. Since in many cases circumvention of digital rights management (DRM) is the only way forward in order to achieve content portability, the question arises whether it is similarly unlawful to share the account information, thus allowing the content to be accessed by a third party. For the purposes of this work content portability refers to the ability to play a work on several devices, to share files and to time-, space-or format-shift files. Therefore, this article concentrates on the private copying exception, which can be considered as the common denominator behind the aforementioned acts, in the context of which it is examined whether accountsharing can constitute an alternative legitimate option to unlawful circumvention of DRMs applied to works. To the extent this examination covers both USA and European developments in the area of anti-circumvention legislation interpretation it can be considered comparative. However, the main focus of this article is European law and its main purpose is to show that the sharing of account information in order to achieve content portability does not fall foul of the European anti-circumvention legislation and, thus, contribute to the wider dialogue for the development of a more balanced European digital copyright law.

J	Yasin, N				Yasin, Naveed			Broken Out and Bust: Ayub Khan Clothing Ltd	ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT CASES			English	Article						Immigrant; entrepreneurship; Manchester; growth; enclave; Pakistani; break out		This case focuses on the strategic concepts of motivation, resources and the notion of 'breakout' which is a common strategic growth strategy associated with ethnic entrepreneurship. The breakout strategy encourages small ethnic businesses, which typically operate in ethnic enclaves serving their co-ethnic populations, to modify their strategy and alternatively target the indigenous population. In doing so, this case relates to the owner of Ayub Khan Clothing Limited being advised by a business support agency to relocate his business from an ethnic enclave of Manchester to the city centre of Manchester to target a wider range of native customers. Although academic literature encourages ethnic businesses to breakout into the mainstream market, little work has been done in considering the implications on practice for ethnic-owned businesses. Such a risky growth strategy could also lead to failure for owners of ethnic businesses. This case also highlights whether local business support agents and agencies should consider ethnic businesses to be identical to mainstream ( native) businesses. Some may argue that these difficulties contributed towards the bankruptcy of Ayub Khan Clothing Limited which once was a successful business operating in a vibrant ethnic enclave of Manchester.

It has an effect on the pro fit margins and, subsequently, on the strategic behavior of a firm in terms of innovation activities. In this study, the relationship of appropriability and expropriability is clarified, and empirical evidence from 299 companies is provided to increase understanding of the strategic protection of intellectual assets. The results indicate that industries differ in terms of expropriability and that innovation performance depends on the level of expropriability.

J	Ji, S; Huang, LP; Wang, J				Ji, Sai; Huang, Liping; Wang, Jin			A Novel Key Management Scheme Supporting Network Dynamic Update in Wireless Sensor Network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article						WSNs; Security authentication; Improvement of the leach algorithm; Dynamic network update; AVL tree		With the development of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology, it has been adopted in a wide variety of applications such as the health care system and so on. Yet, there are still some problems need to be addressed, one of which is the security issue. A lot of schemes from different points of view were proposed to ensure the security in WSNs, however, most of them are proposed for static networks while it is less to consider the situation for the security of the dynamic topology update. Our paper is a novel key management scheme for the dynamic WSNs. The security authentication and random key distribution were initialized in the network deployment phase. During the network stable phase, in order to ensure the real-time update security for the network topology, our scheme proposed a dynamic updated key based on the AVL tree. Simulation result shows that this program can ensure the WSN's dynamic security as well as achieve the energy efficiency goal.

J	Agnihotri, A				Agnihotri, Arpita			Turnaround of Harley Davidson - cult brand or strategic fit approach?	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						cult brand; turnaround management; strategic fit; marketing and strategy		Brand building has been studied from a marketing perspective for ages. Through this case study, we explain how Harley Davidson leveraged cult branding as a grand strategy and not a mere marketing strategy for its successful turnaround. Further, it is explained that it was fit amongst various human resources, operations, marketing, finance and distribution strategies with cult brand strategy, which made the turnaround of Harley Davidson successful. Our study hence throws light on the 'strategic fit' aspect between grand and functional strategies, an important criteria which is often overlooked, especially in turnaround management.

The first objective is to investigate firm exploitation of search engine optimisation (SEO) techniques with respect to website traffic. The second objective is to report on the searching habits of Internet users. This study uses a qualitative descriptive approach that analyses 15 different case studies of business to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C) companies. These companies include nine banks, four telecommunication companies and two automotive companies. The in depth, semi-structured interviews were administered by telephone and/or personal interviews. Additionally, a questionnaire-based survey was administered to Internet users to determine their web use and searching habits. The results demonstrate that firms are currently exploiting SEO at a limited level, that the use of social media is rare and that firms do not consider users' searching habits. This study also reveals that 84% of web users spend up to two hours daily searching the Internet. The dominant search engine (i.e., the engine used by 90% of users) is Google. The use of social sites such as Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and Orkut is high among users (i.e., 85%). This study highlights the opportunities that SEO provides to companies with respect to the use of their corporate website as a strategic marketing tool.

With a goal for companies to reduce slack and to stream line inventory by moving to more modem practices such as just-intime inventories it looked like warehousing was going to be superseded. The goal to streamline inventory is still intact, but warehousing has not only survived, it has picked up steam as a strategic logistics tool. Man things have allowed warehouses pick up business. Another reason has been their ability to justify their existence by finding better ways to meet the needs of their customers. In order to ensure better customer service warehouses have worked on their efficiency and accuracy. There are many ways to become more efficient; such as, order picking, operator training, and warehouse layout just to name a few.

If the precision of the definition of industry is desirable, it involves a multiplicity of elements that restrict the ability of generalization. This paper aims to contribute by identifying clusters of industries with similar environmental profiles. As the discriminant validity of the OTE construct was tested only by Harris in US manufacturing industry, not supporting it, this study also seeks to contribute by assessing the OTE construct validity for the Brazilian manufacturing industry. Design/methodology/approach - Authors collected data from all manufacturing sectors in Brazil, between 1996 and 2003; they used confirmatory factor analysis with the multi- trait multi- method matrix approach to assess the construct validity and ran environmental dimensions' factorial scores through the cluster analysis to find out natural groupings of industries. Findings - The results support the convergent and discriminant validity of the construct OTE, suggesting that further replication should be conducted in the US economy and in different economic contexts. Research limitations/implications - The study identified four groups of industries with similar environmental conditions, increasing possibilities of generalization of researches. The limitations stem from measurement in an extended period of time and not measuring changes in the environment. Practical implications - To expand the analytical capabilities of managers for decision making on the sharing of skills between businesses in different industries. Originality/value - The main contributions of this work are to further discussions on the validity of the OTE construct and to identify industrial clusters of homogeneous environments.

J	Casadei, S; Bellezza, M; Casagrande, L; Pierleoni, A				Casadei, Stefano; Bellezza, Michele; Casagrande, Luca; Pierleoni, Arnaldo			An analytic-geospatial approach for sustainable water resource management: a case study in the province of Perugia	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						water resource; decision support system; WebGIS		Water is a strategic, but also highly vulnerable, natural resource. This because the increasing demand from multiple uses, in many cases competing amongst them, seems to influence the concepts of sustainability of the exploitation. From the operational point of view, the studied system is an integrated decision support system. It is not only a platform to exchange information and assessments, but also a tool for conflict resolution, in the management of water resources, to obtain the consensus among all participants in the decisional processes. So the canonical "top-down" approach has been replaced with a "bottom-up" approach where all stakeholders become decision makers themselves. The application of the aforementioned approach was studied for the Tiber River basin and has been applied to the Province of Perugia area. The study focused to the building of a spatial database of hydrological data and multipurpose water withdrawals, together with the setting of the evaluation model for the surface water resources. This model bases its algorithms on regionalization procedures of flow parameters. For the definition of the river condition, hydrological indices calculated from the hydrological database have been used, while for the existing withdrawals, an analysis procedure has been developed, that from the point of interest directly selected on the map, finds out the upstream basin and, by means of overlay procedures, identifies the upstream water uses and the total flow that could be extracted. The potential of the system and the technologies used are contained in a WEB platform that allows the analysis of the database of water uses/withdrawals on the cartography, and the comparison with the hydrogeological characteristics of the sub-basin examined. The purpose of this study is to provide software tools that can be used as a support in water resource evaluation and management policies at the basin scale.

REALITIES AND PERSPECTIVES OF FINANCIAL-ACCOUNTING NATURE ON MATERNITY AND PATERNITY IN ROMANIA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						maternity protection; paternity; parenting; benefits; accounting		Holistic picture of the realities and perspectives on maternity and child-rearing in Romania can not be shaped without considering its financial accounting dimensions. Reality reveals: demographic decline generating financial pressures on future generations; the existence of multiple forms of protection of maternity and child-rearing (leaves, allowances, etc.); financial involvement (assumption of costs) from beneficiaries, employers and state institutions; direct accounting transposition of the mentioned social benefits, based on employer-recipient or beneficiary-state institutions pair combinations and the accounting management principle, etc. Prospects are outlined around the desire to redress the demographic situation and are concerned with: the need for organisational policies regarding the protection of maternity and child-rearing to be disseminated and clarified to employees since they are employed; a positive attitude of the employers which should demonstrate strategic orientation in amortisation of investment costs in future generations; an accounting approach that should exploit information valences of the explanatory notes, promote its social side and maximise the utility of information to users, etc.	1 Decembrie 1918 Univ Alba Iulia, Alba Iulia 510009, Romania		Cenar, I (corresponding author), 1 Decembrie 1918 Univ Alba Iulia, 11-13 Nicolae Iorga St, Alba Iulia 510009, Romania.	cenar_iuliana@yahoo.com					[Anonymous], 2004, GUID UND APPL IAS 19; Burja C, 2009, J ENVIRON PROT ECOL, V10, P452; Feleaga L., 2007, FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING; GEORGOPOULOS A., 2001, J ENVIRON PROT ECOL, V2, P26; GHETAU V., 2004, J ROMANIAN SOCIOL, VII, P8; International Federation of Accountants, 2009, HDB INT ACC STAND PU, VII; Kouzmanova I, 2006, J ENVIRON PROT ECOL, V7, P471; STROESCU V., 2013, MATERNITY ROMANIAN S	8	0	0	0	6	SCIBULCOM LTD	SOFIA	PO BOX 249, 1113 SOFIA, BULGARIA	1311-5065			J ENVIRON PROT ECOL	J.

To derive decentralized solutions that do not require complete information and any cooperation among the users, we formulate this problem as a supermodular game, which each user maximizes its utility function provided transmission rate constraints. Through analyzing the supermodular property of the game, the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) are established. Furthermore, we propose a distributed price and power update algorithm (DPPA) to compute the solution of the game which is based on myopic best response. Performance evaluations via numerical simulations verify the existence of theNE and the convergence property of the DPPA algorithm.

J	Conteh, C				Conteh, Charles			Transitions in regional development policy implementation in Canada: the cases of New Brunswick and Manitoba	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANADIAN STUDIES			English	Article						Regional Economic Development; Federalism; Multi-Level Governance; Decentralization; Canadian Public Management; Governance; Globalization; Innovation	NETWORKS	Research on policy implementation in Canada and around the world is seeking to address the nexus of the mandates, resources, and cultures of public agencies and their wider institutional and socio-political context. This article examines the implications of the transition in the framing of policy implementation processes from 'administration' to 'governance' by looking at regional economic development policy implementation in the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Manitoba since the mid-1980s. These two provinces are part of geographically determined regions classified under Canada's official regional development policy as socioeconomically disadvantaged in relation to the rest of the country. Regional development policy itself has undergone a noticeable shift in policy discourse among public managers over the past decade towards an emphasis on 'promoting innovation' as the rationale for policy intervention. The implications of these transitions suggest that policy implementation or program delivery tasks in complex intergovernmental systems are best viewed as strategic, and not merely operational.

J	Cucurnia, A				Cucurnia, Alessandra			Programming instruments as strategic devices for efficiency in the implementation processes of public utility works	TECHNE-JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY FOR ARCHITECTURE AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Regulations; Building Process; Programming; Efficiency; Verification and Validation		The article represents a critical reading of the framework legislation on the creation of Public Works aimed at highlighting the important role it attributes to programming instruments as strategic devices for the efficient management of implementation processes. Starting with a summary of the critical issues detected in the performance practices and considering their main determining causes, the contribution emphasises the value of the impact that, for the purposes of the efficiency of procedural models and control devices, the effects induced by the outcomes of the programming period have on the entire realization process, and specifically on the planning phase. It also points out, in this regard, the importance of the "circularity" that characterizes the construction process.

Helping Undergraduates Think Like A CEO: The APPLE Analysis as a Teaching Tool for Strategic Management	E-JOURNAL OF BUSINESS EDUCATION & SCHOLARSHIP OF TEACHING			English	Article						Strategic management; teaching tools; experiential learning; undergraduate; mental models		This paper presents a class assignment, entitled the APPLE Analysis, for developing pre-analysis comprehension about company conditions, resources and challenges as a part of the undergraduate strategic management capstone course. Because undergraduate students lack the causal maps of seasoned executives, this assignment helps students to develop an appropriate frame of reference to then tackle more traditional external/internal approaches to strategic analysis as a part of a live consulting case. The article describes the background for the development of the assignment, the components of each application tool and its assessment, and then summarizes with a description of student perceptions and outcomes. The results of its first application indicate strong student support for its ability to deliver on content outcomes, with 74.9% noting its value in understanding course and analytical concepts, and an ANOVA analysis of the differences in final project analysis scores in the semester postadoption to be significantly higher at the.10 level (F=2.944; p =.092) than scores in the semester pre-adoption when controlling for professor. Faculty also noted stronger integration of multiple levels and breadth of analysis for the more traditional live case consulting analysis.	[Domke-Damonte, Darla J.; Keels, J.

The development of smart grids is considered a strategic goal at both national and international levels and has been funded by many research programs. Within the BEE (Building Energy Ecosystems) project, funded by the Piedmont Region under the European POR FESR 2007-13 scheme, the creation of an electricity smart grid at a local level in a small agroindustry was done. This industry is one of the so-called prosumer, that is both a producer and a consumer of energy. The energy production is done by means of solar photovoltaic and biomass. In this local smart grid, the elements were subdivided in two main groups: loads (process machineries in the case study) and generators (PV and biomass in the case study). The loads may be further subdivided into permanent loads, mandatory loads and shiftable loads. The objective of the smart grid is the minimization of the exchanges between the local grid and the public utility grid. Even though no financial savings occur, this is important for the community grid. The problem is therefore to find the conditions that let the net exported energy going to zero at each time step, so arriving close to a self-sufficient system by modifying the shiftable loads. In a first phase of the study, the consumers were studied and, according to some characteristics of the machineries employed and the production requirements, grouped into production lines that can or not be switched off for intervals of time in order to compensate the smart grid fluctuations. The smart grid balancing may be done on an instantaneous basis, or in a predictive way considering the future weather forecasts and the future production requirements. The demo site was equipped with measurement instrumentation, data acquisition tools and a user interface that may be used to visualize all the quantities that are measured but also to perform the actions suggested by the optimization strategy (start/stop machineries, organization of production, etc).

There have been numerous experiences in Italy over the last decade, but they have not always produced positive and concrete results. Although procedures of international standing might refer to consolidated guide-lines, in most cases, on the local scale, the level of attention is insufficient to ensure ubiquitous quality in results. Participation in the work on the part of a jury, was welcomed as a useful opportunity to try out an approach, outside the academic sphere, based around the technological culture of design. Whatever the limitations of a local environment, it was felt that the experience might take on a generalizable significance, in contributing to thinking about the demand for quality as a precondition to the effectiveness of processes, an objective that is more indispensable tor client has strategic roles and responsibilities.

In order to effectively avoid the defects of a traditional discounted cash flow (DCF) method, a trinomial tree pricing model of the real option is improved. In the case of Molybdenum ore, a theoretical method for the hurdle price under the optimal investment timing is constructed. Based on the example data, the option price model is simulated. According to the characteristics of metal mine, cut-off grade, reserve estimation and mine life in different price can be quantified. The result shows that it is reliable and practical to enhance the accuracy for mining investment decision.

J	Han, YQ; Kong, R				Han, Yaqin; Kong, Rui			Research on the development and planning of renewable energy in Tibet	CHINESE JOURNAL OF POPULATION RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Tibet; renewable energy; energy development and planning; factors analysis; hierarchical clustering		With the rapid social and economic development of the Tibet Autonomous Region, the situation in regard to energy supply and demand is increasingly tense. Meanwhile, the development of renewable energy in Tibet has been given considerable practical significance by its peculiar ecological environment. Given the complementarity of renewable energies in Tibet, using the method of factor analysis, we derived four major factors: level of economic development, social development, industrial development, and energy endowment, which help to evaluate development conditions in different regions of Tibet. Treating these four factors equally, we used the hierarchical clustering method to determine the order of regional development. Thus we acquire a three-stage planning project for renewable energy. In the first stage, Lhasa plays a leading role in promoting the development of renewable energy, particularly that based on solar and wind energy. There are two phases in the second stage, the first being to simultaneously develop solar and wind energy in Xigaze and Nyingchi. The second is to develop solar and wind energy in accordance with the time of year in Qamdo, Nagqu, and Ali, with 1.145 billion kWh electricity to be generated. The third stage is to develop energy production in Lhoka Prefecture, with 1.369 billion kWh electricity to be generated. At the end of the three-stage project, consumption of available electricity will have reached 4.045 billion kWh, with major social and economic benefits.

J	Jegede, OO; Ojo, BF				Jegede, Oluseye O.; Ojo, Blessing F.			Science and Technology Activities in the Emerging Economies: Options for Nigeria	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						R&D intensity; Scientific outputs; Imitation; S&T knowledge; Industry	MANAGEMENT	This study identifies how two emerging economies developed science and technology capabilities through science and technology (S&T) education/training, research and experimental development. This was done in order to recommend policy options for Nigeria for the development of its industrial sector and improvement of its global competitiveness. The study used secondary data sources. Data were sourced from different published sources, the Internet and company records. Two Asian countries (China and South Korea) were purposively selected for this study due to their global contribution in the areas of electronics and semiconductors, coupled with their volume of exports. The study showed that China acquired S&T knowledge mainly through research and experimental development. This was achieved by increasing the amount of GDP allocated to R&D by 87.5% within 17 years to overtake the USA, Japan and South Korea. Also, within this period, China grew their scientific and technological research output by 16.5% annually. China's science and technology education/training approach increased its annual doctorate degree holders by 18.7%, above Japan (2.9%), Germany (1.0%) and the USA (0.4%); this was achieved by sponsoring a large number of PhD students in the USA within this reference period. About the same time, China increased the percentage of GNP allocated to S&T education between 1975 and 1990 from 2.2% and to 4.5% between 1975 and 1985; this made China's economy grow by 9% between 1979 and 1990 and by 12% between 1990 and 2010. These efforts, amongst others, made China the world's second largest economy with 8.5% of the world's GDP and the highest contributor to world growth, closely followed by the USA, India, Korea and Brazil. South Korea, on the other hand, developed their S&T knowledge through research and experimental development skills but indigenously by initiating, imitating, improving and innovating on knowledge from external sources. This strategy worked so well that Korean firms overtook their pioneers in the USA and Japan within 12 years in the semiconductor industry. Samsung (a Korean company) exceeded Sony (a Japanese company) in 2005 to become the world's largest producer of electronics, and surpassed Motorola in 2007 to become the world's second largest mobile phone maker. In 2009, Samsung became the world's largest technology company with sales of KRW139 trillion globally, thereby overtaking Hewlett-Packard (USA) and Siemens (Germany); while only joining the industry in the 1980s, Samsung concentrated efforts on R&D investments in electronics and building core competence in the semiconductor industry. In conclusion, the study found that Nigeria can adopt and adapt any combinations of these strategies. Though some of these strategies cannot be directly deployed in Nigeria due to the peculiarity of Nigeria, which is characterized by vision volatility which in turn aggravates policy precariousness. There are other potential limiting factors like social acceptability, limited infrastructure and poverty level that would influence which policy strategy fits well. The study ends by recommending strategic implications for practice by the industry while advising government on policy.

Contemporary demographic processes forcing increasing attention to the problems of relationships and dependencies between the different age groups. The ageing of the population in each society leads to changes in the contacts between young people, adults and the elderly. It is reasonable to undertake research on the concept of "solidarity of generations". Maintaining relationships without generational conflict requires actions in the field of social policy known as intergenerational policy. Aim of this article is to present some of its models, which allow not only to analyze the changes in the various communities, but also to create recommendations for public intervention. Description will include activities at the international, national, regional and local levels.

THE ANALYSIS OF DEVELOPMENT OF CONCESSION ARRANGEMENTS IN THE METALLURGICAL INDUSTRY OF RUSSIA	JOURNAL OF MINING INSTITUTE			Russian	Article						concession arrangements; public-private partnership; social and economic development		Implementation of high and steady development rates of metallurgical industry is considerably connected with introduction of the mechanism of public-private partnership in the form of concession agreements. Concessions allow to degrade financial loading from the state by means of redistribution of risks between all participants; to establish rigid enough long-term legally issued connexion that allows participants of agreements to carry out strategic forecasting and planning of the activity. The concession form of managing is the effective tool of private capital attraction, including foreign in real sector of economy, including in metallurgy without loss of strategic control over the vital systems and objects. The analysis has shown that efficiency of the application of concession business pattern and their contribution to social and economic development of the state is the ultimate under conditions of long-term consecutive planning and the system approach from the state to management of concession activity.

Gang exit strategies have been identified in the Alberta Gang Reduction Strategy (Government of Alberta, 2010) as a key activity in reducing gang-related violent crime and violence in the province. The purpose of this article is to explore available academic and gray literature on gang exit to support the development of gang exit interventions in the province. Findings from the review point to the diversity and complexity of gang involvement and membership, and the consequent need for multidimensional approaches to gang exit. Exit programs must address the root causes of membership, and identify and address barriers to pro-social activities. The complexity of gang membership also requires a strategic approach to programming that includes single case management, intensive training, and targeted outreach, as well as multiple systems involvement. Importantly, as Alberta moves forward with its Gang Reduction Strategy, systematic, comprehensive research studies on the "gang problem" in Alberta and its associated impact on the community are vital for the development of effective intervention strategies.

Erosion - deposition evaluation through hybrid DTMs derived by LiDAR and colour bathymetry: the case study of the Brenta, Piave and Tagliamento rivers	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						LiDAR data; DGPS survey; Colour bathymetry; Floods; Geomorphic changes; Gravel Bed River	QUANTIFICATION	Risk management and flood protection are frequently assessed through geo-morphometric evaluations resulting by floods events. If we aim at elevation models with high resolutions and covering large areas, airborne LiDAR surveys can represent a good compromise among costs, time and uncertainty. The major limitation of the non-bathymetric LiDAR surveys consists in the detection of wet areas. Indeed, accounting for more than 20 cm of water depth, LiDAR signal increases exponentially its error. In this paper we present a comparison of the results concerning the application of a colour bathymetry methodology for the production of hybrid DTMs (HDTM). These elevation models were derived by merging LiDAR data for the dry areas and colour bathymetry for the wet areas. The methodological approach consists in a statistical regression between water depth and RGB band intensity values from contemporary aerial images. This methodology includes the use of filters in order to reduce possible errors due to the application of the model, to estimate precise "in-channel" points. The study areas are three different human impacted gravel-bed rivers of the North-East of Italy. This methodology has been applied in three sub-reaches of Brenta River, two of Piave River and two of Tagliamento River before and after relevant flood events with recurrence interval >= 10 years. Potentials and limitations of the applied bathymetric method, the comparison of its use in different fluvial contexts and its possibility of employment for geo-morphometric evaluations, were then tested. DGPS control points (1841, 2638, 10473 respectively for Brenta, Piave and Tagliamento River) were finally used to evaluate the accuracy of wet areas. Results showed that, in each model, wet areas vertical errors were comparable to those featured by LiDAR data for the dry areas.	[Moretto, J.; Delai, F.; Rigon, E.; Picco, L.; Lenzi, M.

Thus, it tries to be ethical from a human development viewpoint. This contribution shows that the three Porter's options, 'Differentiation','Cost Domination' and 'Concentration', can be reduced to the one and only 'Differentiation' strategy in order (1) to develop international sustainable competitive advantages of any nature except cost, (2) avoid price wars, and (3) support Human Development.

Taking in to account the University's strategic commitment to the expansion of its diversity profile among newcomer first-year students from 24 per cent in 2010 to 33 per cent by 2015, it became essential to examine enrolment trends. A quantitative analysis of enrolment trends over the past six intake years was therefore undertaken, with specific reference to population group, language, academic performance at school, geographical area and accommodation, socio-economic status and the use of information sources. From the findings it was evident that enrolment trends should inform a transformation strategy. In this article important recommendations are made for a strategy to widen participation and improve the enrolment rates of students of colour.

J	Protasova, L; Schehorskyy, A				Protasova, Larisa; Schehorskyy, Anatoly			The efficiency in the strategic indicators system of dairy processing enterprises	UKRAINIAN FOOD JOURNAL			Ukrainian	Article						Strategic; Efficiency; Dairy; Enterprises		The peculiarities of the strategic index system development is presented in the article. The methodology for calculating the efficiency integral index of dairy processing enterprises is considered. The main component method is applied. The selection of efficiency indexes for integral index calculation is done on example of the balanced index system for the following groups: "Finance", "Clients", "Business processes", "Personnel". Here, the efficiency indexes, which are included into the group "Business processes", are selected within the stages of the chain for cost creation by the dairy processing enterprises. The integral efficiency index of dairy processing enterprises is used as "the strategic landmark", which aims to direct the management personnel at setting goals, grounding the selection of optimum development strategy and its realization, evaluation of the results obtained. The importance of such approach is conditioned by the fact, that the diversity of the proposed analytical researches of internal and external environment is the basis for the enterprise selection of the development direction, setting strategic goals and strategic alternative determination All this makes the planning process complex.

J	Qin, LH; Jing, RT; Long, C				Qin, Linghua; Jing, Runtian; Long, Cheryl			Industry strategic variety and performance The role of market and institutional forces in the Chinese industrial enterprises	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						China; Organizational change; Market forces; Newly industrialized economies; Institutional transition; Strategic variety; Industry performance		Purpose - Market-based theories assume that firms' different strategic commitments to businesses lead to different strategic positions within the industry. While the institutional perspective from organization theory emphasizes the institutional pressures which lead to legitimacy and firm isomorphism, it is not clear yet how intra-industry organizations behave during institutional transitions. The purpose of this paper is to combine the insights of these theories by examining the role of market and institutional forces in affecting industry strategic variety and its impact on average industry performance in transitional China, based on the strategic view of neoinstitutional theory. Design/methodology/approach - Empirical tests are carried out using industrial enterprise data of China from 2000 to 2006. Findings - Empirical results using industrial enterprise data of China from 2000 to 2006 suggest that: industry competitiveness has a strong positive influence on strategic variety; the weakening relationship between government and market leads to increased strategic variety; and indicators of strategic variety have complicated effects on industry performance. Originality/value - The strategic view of neoinstitutional theory was used to gain a better understanding of intra-industry strategic variety during the institutional transition of China. Thus this paper combines seemingly contradictory theories in our understanding of how intra-industry organizations behave in response to institutional change.

A rigorous quantitative study of consultancy skills applied to a carefully selected-and as representative as possible-sample of more than 100 senior management consultants from both Emirati and expatriate background demonstrates potential blocks to progress and the need for more specific communication abilities to overcome them. Set in context of real work experience through the analysis of a work diary and in more strategic context by the analysis of a range of consultancy job descriptions, findings are placed alongside current and classic cultural literature.

It induces a dominant strategy incentive compatible equilibrium among all rational and selfish nodes. We show that our protocol is network-wide socially desirable and Pareto optimal. DSIC-S guarantees the delivery of consumer's security services within desired levels, naturally and trustfully, reinforced by our nesting security model. We address resource management and delay-efficiency through synergy of several design aspects. We propose a scenario-based security model with different levels. We incorporate a valuation system to integrate the caused delay at each node in selection of security algorithms without consumer's knowledge of the actual delays. We achieve this by incorporating our valuation system, in particular that of the consumer's, in the calculation of the credit transfers with Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) payments and Clarke's pivotal rule. We prove that DSIC-S design solves the revelation theorem's problem of misrepresentation of agents' private information in mechanism design theory. We propose an incentive model and incorporate the valuations in these incentives. The simulations validate our theoretical results. They prove the significance of our model and show the correlation of the credit transfers to actual delays and security valuations.

J	Shuib, N; RuhayaAtan, JS				Shuib, NurAfifah; RuhayaAtan, Jamaliah Said			THE INFLUENCE OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, BOARD EFFECTIVENESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY TOWARDS PERFORMANCE: EMPIRICAL TEST OF NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS	ASIA-PACIFIC MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING JOURNAL			English	Article						performance of non-profit organizations; resource dependency theory	TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT; ACCOUNTING INFORMATION; DIRECTORS; AGENCY; FIRM	Non- profit organizations (NPOs) rely on a variety of activities and resource providers to support their mission-related work. Prior researches on the factors influencing the performance of non-profit organizations were largely based on conceptual argument with no empirical support. The Resource- Dependency Theory (RDT) has suggested that external resources of organizations affect NPOs performance. In the light of RDT, this paper examines how financial management practices, level of accountability and board effectiveness affect the performance of NPOs. Based on the analysis from 107 questionnaires received from top level management of NPOs, the finding revealed that there is significant positive relationship between the financial management practices, board effectiveness and the performance of NPOs. This provides an indication that for NPOs to sustain and remain relevant, they need to adopt adequate level of financial management and appoint only board that are actively involved in NPOs strategic direction. This study is important to provide guidelines to NPOs on the strategies that need to be adopted to enhance their performance.

Economic efficiency reveals the absolute size of indicators of efficient usage of resources employed, efficiency and effectiveness of business processes, products and services. While measuring and managing economic efficiency, it is necessary to reflect the influence of internal and external business environment and take into account the diversity of assessment of subject position. Sources of information for assessing the overall economic efficiency of enterprises with subsequent management can be derived from the financial statements of financial accounting. In the proposed plan of economic efficiency it is important for business owners and managers in the to establish appropriate indicators of economic efficiency and to follow and support the long-term strategic goals of the company.

Assessing progress, however, is hampered by limited data outside the Afghan security ministries - the Ministries of Defense and Interior - and by the lack of a common definition of governance. Available reporting suggests building governance capacity is far from complete. Varying definitions of governance, coupled with the use of the term by numerous organizations without defining it, results in addressing too broad a range of issues. It would be more useful to concentrate on the core of governance - providing the services the Afghan government has committed to provide to its citizens. This, in turn, requires that Afghan ministries have the functional capacity to carry out their responsibilities, including financial management, budget formulation and execution, policy and strategic planning, and service delivery. However, time is growing short. The Afghan experience provides some important lessons that could guide future endeavors for the international community. First, this paper discusses progress in building ministerial capacity. Second, it discusses recent efforts to link continued financial assistance to Afghanistan with improved governance. Third, it describes how the lack of a commonly accepted definition of governance complicates assessing progress. Finally, it offers conclusions and observations about the failure to establish an autonomous Afghan governance capacity. For more than a decade, improving governance has been recognized as the most difficult and critical challenge involving Afghan reconstruction.

J	Tang, WN; Xu, FY				Tang, Weining; Xu, Fuyuan			An empirical research of B2C enterprise strategic risk evaluation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						strategic risk evaluation; PSO; particle swarm optimisation; WNN; wavelet neural network; B2C; mobile communication; index system	MANAGEMENT; NETWORKS	Based on the concept of B2C enterprise strategic risk, a risk evaluation index system is set up which consists of five elements, including financial condition, market competition, enterprise resource, enterprise capability and business process, firstly. Secondly, a corresponding comprehensive evaluation method based on Particle Swarm Optimisation-Wavelet Neural Network (PSO-WNN) is proposed in detail for B2C enterprise strategic risk evaluation. Finally, an empirical research for B2C enterprise strategic risk evaluation was discussed using the suggested method. The simulation results show that the level of B2C enterprise strategic risk can be evaluated quantitatively by the PSO-WNN model proposed in this paper and the shortcomings of current assessment methods, such as more subjectivity, randomness and fuzzy conclusion, can be overcome. In addition, the comparison between the mentioned approach and WNN was made, and finally it was concluded that PSO-WNN has better learning ability and more fast convergence rate than that of WNN.

J	Tauer, LW				Tauer, Loren W.			Life insurance funding of buy-sell arrangements in family businesses	JOURNAL OF FAMILY BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic planning; Succession planning; Organizational structures		Purpose - Buy-sell arrangements for the death of a co-owner may be funded with life insurance. Although many factors may enter the decision of whether to fund the buy-sell with life insurance, the degree of tolerance to risk is a major factor. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the risk aversion necessary to make life insurance funding the preferred option. Design/methodology/approach - The decision whether to use life insurance was modeled using the expected utility theorem under state-dependent utility. Aversion to risk was varied to determine at what risk aversion levels insurance was preferred. Analysis was done for difference ages and thus mortality risk and for difference levels of insurance markups. Findings - Life insurance funding is preferred at relatively low amounts of risk aversion, especially if the surviving partner becomes more risk averse upon the co-owner's death. A lower percentage of life insurance would be used if insurance premiums are significantly above actuarially fair premiums. Practical implications - Given currently available insurance rates, most closely held small businesses probably should fund their buy-sell arrangements activated upon death of a partner with life insurance. However, cash flow constraints may hinder insurance purchase and planning may be myopic in that more imminent strategy issues may be present that a future death. Originality/value - Although the use of life insurance to fund buy-sell arrangements is typically suggested for the small closely held business, little economic or financial analysis has been completed to date.

J	Untiedt, R; Nippa, M; Pidun, U				Untiedt, Robert; Nippa, Michael; Pidun, Ulrich			Application matters: how different corporate portfolio management practices impact firm performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						corporate portfolio management; CPM; business performance management; multi-business firms; global survey; firm performance; planning methods; portfolio planning; strategic planning; strategy implementation		The advantageousness of corporate portfolio management (CPM) and particularly of CPM tools has been disputed among scholars for decades. A few studies that systematically analysed the relationship between applying CPM tools and firm performance are suggestive of proving a rather negative effect. Beyond just revisiting and reassessing prior research, this paper contributes to the strategic planning literature by empirically testing the impact of different CPM practices on corporate performance. Applying a multi-method approach of qualitative interviews, a global survey among senior executives of the world's largest companies supplemented with additional financial data, findings show a significant positive relationship between the frequency and rigor of CPM usage and corporate performance which partly contrasts previous research. Furthermore, considerable differences of CPM implementation and practices between top-performing companies and underperformers are identified. The study advances scholarly knowledge with regard to the relevance of strategic planning processes. Implications for future research and practitioners are highlighted.

J	Weger, H				Weger, Harry, Jr.			Engineering argumentation in marriage Pragma-dialectics, strategic maneuvering, and the "fair fight for change" in marriage education	JOURNAL OF ARGUMENTATION IN CONTEXT			English	Article						strategic maneuvering; marital argument; Fair Fight for Change; pragma dialectics	CONVERSATIONAL ARGUMENT; COMMUNICATION; CONSEQUENCES; CONFLICT	Understanding argumentation in marriage as a design enterprise focuses researchers' efforts in understanding how such arguments can go wrong and helps to identify designs that might help reduce unproductive conflict. Given the importance many marriage experts place on successful conflict management, designing procedures that help couples resolve their differences can potentially reduce the negative personal and societal results of failed marriages. In this paper I analyze the Fair Fight for Change (FFFC) conflict management procedure as a strategic maneuvering activity type. The purpose of this analysis is to examine the adequacy of the procedure itself in helping couples produce rational decisions about marital disagreements balanced by strategic maneuvers aimed to maintain the identity and relationship needs of the participants. Specifically, I recommend a redesign of the FFFC that incorporates a simplified version of the critical discussion rules to help guide couples as they attempt to resolve their differences.

J	Yang, B; Zhang, WG; Feng, YX				Yang, Bo; Zhang, Weiguo; Feng, Yuexuan			Statistical Model for the Relationship between Knowledge, Ability, Strategy of Start-ups and Their Competitive Advantages	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS & STATISTICS			English	Article						Start-ups; knowledge; ability; strategy; competitive advantage		The knowledge, ability and strategies for start-ups are vital factors which affect their competitive advantages. These authors choose 238 different start-ups in Chongqing, China as the sample of empirical research by analyzing the relationships between the factors such as knowledge, abilities and strategies of start-ups and their competitive advantages. The results show that: knowledge and ability do not have a direct impact on competitive advantage, but the enterprise strategy does; through their enterprise strategies, knowledge and abilities have the indirect impacts on their competitive advantages. And start-ups can follow this path to gain the competitive advantages: with knowledge management, start-ups can improve their abilities, then, with strategic competition, they can obtain competitive advantages.

To answer these questions, the objective of this paper is to analyze whether and how a bridge can be built between qualitative and quantitative approaches for land-use planning work and to find out a way to overcome the gap that exists between the ability to construct computer simulation models to aid integrated land-use plan making and the demand for them by planning professionals. The study presented a theoretical framework of land-use planning based on scenario analysis (SA) method and multiagent system (MAS) simulation integration and selected freshwater wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain of China as a case study area. Study results showed that MAS simulation technique emphasizing quantitative process effectively compensated for the SA method emphasizing qualitative process, which realized the organic combination of qualitative and quantitative land-use planning work, and then provided a new idea and method for the land-use planning and sustainable managements of land resources.

J	But, OA				But, O. A.			PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF KNOWLEDGE-BASED MANAGEMENT AS A NEW MANAGEMENT THEORY	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE			Russian	Article						post-industrial society; the economy of knowledge; information technology; Knowledge-based Management; Knowledge Management		The article looks at the philosophical underpinnings of the latest organization management theory, which views knowledge as the most important strategic resource. The birth of this theory was triggered by the transition of developed nations to the innovation economy, which is a stage of economic development where the most significant role in the process of goods production and service accomplishment is played by intellectual resources. Increasing the effectiveness of the use of these resources is one of the most difficult challenges facing today's managers, which requires formation of specific approaches to organization management and encourages creation, dissemination and effective application of knowledge. The past twenty years have been marked by a fast transition from futuristic speculation to the clear need for adaptation to the realities of the society of knowledge. This transition has been much faster and more intensive than expected, which leads to considerable difficulties in understanding the changes that are taking place. The transition to the society of knowledge has required reconsideration of the existing organization management theories as well as organization management practice. There was a major shift in the organization management theory and practice in the 1990s. Before the 1990s knowledge was viewed just as information storage. Today knowledge is thought of as allow. In other words, today the emphasis is placed on the life of knowledge within an organization. The shift to the new idea of knowledge in the 1990s in the West lead to the birth of a new management theory called Knowledge Management (KM). Today the Knowledge Management theory is only becoming popular in Russia. The unusual combination of words in the name of the theory causes common misunderstanding of the meaning of the term. Some researchers prefer to use the English term rather than translate it into Russian, as the term Knowledge Management can be translated into Russian in different ways with a difference in meaning. Understanding of the new term is also hampered by the confusion in the way western researchers understand and use the term. While some researchers view Knowledge Management as serving a particular functional objective, to others Knowledge Management is a new paradigm of organization management. It would be wrong to say that the different ways in which the term is employed conflict with one another but there is an obvious need for a logically structured system of the theory. Knowledge Management finds itself at the crossing of 3 three fields: Business Administration, Information science, Humanities. These three sides allow viewing Knowledge Management from different angles as well formulating different objectives depending on the object in question.Many Russian companies make a common mistake of applying a technocraticc approach with an emphasis on using information and communication technology which is ineffective in itself and reminds an empty water pipe network. Misunderstanding of the theory of Knowledge Management leads to its low efficiency. The author believes that there is a need for different terms for management of knowledge and organization management based on the primary role of knowledge and suggests the term Knowledge-based Management that would integrate all the different approaches and emphasize the importance of paying attention to all the aspects of Knowledge Management being the core of Knowledge-based Management.

The sensible resistance of a programmed eFuse link is a half smaller than that of the single-ended counterpart and BL datum can be sensed without a reference voltage. With this 2D array of differential paired eFuse OTP memory cells, we design a 32-bit eFuse OTP memory IP. We use a sense amplifier based D F/F circuit as the BL (bit-line) SA (sense amplifier) and design a sensing margin test circuit with a variable pull-up load. It is confirmed by the function test that the designed 32-bit OTP memory IP functions normally on 30 sample dies.

The purpose of this effort was to; (1) provide a complete workable definition for Army water security, (2) conduct the first comprehensive study of water security management in the Army, and (3) identify the key issues on which Army leadership can focus to ensure that the Army has enough water of suitable quality for the foreseeable future. A review of key policy drivers was followed by a series of interviews of personnel inside and outside the Army. The culminating effort identified four major goal areas, three of which apply to stateside military installations: (1) water resources sustainability - preserve sources, protect rights, (2) reduce demand, and (3) maintain infrastructure integrity and security. This paper provides a condensed view of the objectives associated with each of these three goals.

J	Mainwaring, L; Comper, P; Hutchison, M; Richards, D				Mainwaring, Lynda; Comper, Paul; Hutchison, Michael; Richards, Doug			Sport as Laboratory: Lessons Learned From Baseline and Postconcussion Assessment Research	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SPORT PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Postconcussionconcussion; mild traumatic brain injury; ethics; neuropsychology; sport		Knowledge and awareness of sport concussion has been forwarded by research modeled on the neuropsychological testing paradigm associated with Barth's "sport as laboratory" assessment model. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate lessons learned from that research. Key considerations for planning and implementing large-scale studies of concussion in sport while making adequate provision for the clinical needs of concussed athletes are reviewed. Toward that end, logistical, methodological, and ethical considerations are discussed within the context of research conducted in a university setting. Topics addressed include culture of sport and risk; research planning and design; communication with strategic partners; defining injury; choosing a test battery; data management, outcomes, and analyses; dissemination of results; and finally, clinical and ethical implications that may arise during the research enterprise. The paper concludes with a summary of the main lessons learned and directions for future research.

Allocation of US federal grants for safety-related purposes	JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						General aviation; Airport improvement; Aviation safety		This paper analyzes the US Airport Improvement Program as it relates to the US Federal Aviation Administration's strategic goals for its allocation to general aviation airports for safety-related purposes. The data used describe airports' characteristics, approach slope conditions based on 5010 master records, and Airport Improvement Program grant histories. The key findings include that between fiscal years 2008 and 2009 there was an increase in airports included in the National Plan of Integrated Airports that received AIP funding, and double the number of obstructed approach slopes. However, an increase in AIP money allocation to general aviation airports as a whole existed but not an increase to obstructions removal projects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yuan, B; Peng, BPS; Wu, SM				Yuan, Benjamin; Peng, Bee Pi-Sheng; Wu, Sheng-Ming			Just the Light: Applying Actor Network Theory to Immersion Lithography as Innovation Network Study	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP			English	Article						Actor Network Theory (ANT); immersion lithography; innovation network; strategic decision-making; innovation management; interest-driven network		This study proposes a sociotechnical research method as a novel approach to innovation study. Applying Actor Network Theory (ANT) to the life story of immersion lithography in the semiconductor industry, this study aims to investigate how an innovation is located within both technical and social network, providing a platform for innovation introduction. Innovation life cycle is sometimes expressed via an S-curve indicating performance comparison among competing innovations. Moreover, innovation exists within a community network, or an institutional environment comprising numerous actions, competing products and strategic decisions. Through applying the systematic ethnographic method to analyze actor interactions, including problematisation, interessment, enrollment, mobilization, and dissidence, this study demonstrates how immersion technology successfully developed and became a disruptive innovation to substitute 157nm lithography. As the next generation lithography (NGL), immersion lithography identifies the focus of innovation networks monopolizes resource allocation. Based on the interpretation and hermeneutic method of life story on immersion technology, this study concludes that innovation requires an interest-translation network; the actions of human and non-human actors are interrelated and disruptive innovations are adopted when they passed the obligation passage points (OPPs). Disruptive innovations are based not only on technological superiority but also on the formation of innovation networks.

J	Borchert, M; Klinkhammer, S; Koch, E				Borchert, Margret; Klinkhammer, Stefanie; Koch, Eva			Strategic Productivity Management in Small and Medium-Sized Service Enterprises Using the Service Navigator	ENTERPRISE MODELLING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article							PROFITABILITY	Service productivity has become a widely accepted issue in science and practice. But so far there are no holistic and widely accepted methods for systematic productivity management for services, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Not only quantitative measures play an important role (e.g., financial measures) but also qualitative measures such as service quality or customer satisfaction have to be considered. Furthermore, the incorporation of service and SME specific characteristics has not been effective. In addition, a relationship between performance and productivity management has not been established. Closing this gap requires redefining the concept of service productivity and positioning it in relation to performance measurement. Against this background, the present article aims at presenting the conception and development of a holistic service productivity instrument, the Service Navigator. This instrument is based on a revised definition of strategic productivity that takes the dynamic character of the cause-and-effect relationships between strategic and operative measures into account. The Service Navigator is intended to enable SMEs to measure, assess and control the cause-and-effect relationships among inputs, sub-processes and outputs that are relevant for productivity. Subsequently the results of an explorative qualitative-empirical study on the development of the Service Navigator are presented and finally an outlook on further needs for research is given.

J	Guo, YD; Song, CC; Wang, LL; Wan, ZM				Guo, Yuedong; Song, Changchun; Wang, Lili; Wan, Zhongmei			Impacts of mire reclamation on dynamics of dissolved nutrients in fluvial systems in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING			English	Article							WETLANDS; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; SOILS; RELEASE	As an important nutrient reservoir, the mires in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China have been suffering from large-scale agriculture reclamation since the 1960s. The effects of the long-term reclamation on the dynamics of the dissolved nutrients in fluvial systems are revealed through surveying the export concentrations of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus in the natural mire, degraded mire and drainage ditches during the growing seasons in 2009 and 2010. The results show that the mean concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN, 2.03 +/- 0.355 mg l(-1)) are much higher in natural mire than in degraded mire (1.15 +/- 0.247 mg l(-1)) and ditches (1.03 +/- 0.231 mg l(-1)), and the fraction lessened is primarily the organic part of nitrogen. It indicates that the long-term mire reclamation has led to a significant reduction in TDN concentrations in the surface fluvial system, and has changed the dominant nitrogen components from organic to inorganic formation. In comparison, the concentrations of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) have no significant difference between natural mire and degraded mire or ditches, which demonstrates that mire reclamation has no impact on TDP export dynamics in the fluvial system. The seasonal dynamics of TDN are strongly correlated to dissolved organic carbon at almost all the sample sites, and mire reclamation does not alter the C : N ratio in the fluvial system, but lowers N : P ratio remarkably. The long-term reclamation exerts distinctly different effects on the export dynamics of TDN and TDP in the fluvial system in the Sanjiang Plain. Specific goals and methods ought to be determined if ecological management and recovery measures are to be carried out.

The Advantages of the National Road Safety Council as an Independent National Body promoting road safety in Australia	JOURNAL OF THE AUSTRALASIAN COLLEGE OF ROAD SAFETY			English	Article						Indigenous road safety; National Road Safety Strategy; Road safety advocacy; Road safety leadership; Serious injuries; Stakeholder consultation		In Australia, the accountability for, and management of, road safety rests almost entirely with the states and territories. In order to promote road safety more effectively and nationally, the jurisdictions work together in several ways, including the National Road Safety Executive Group, and the creation of National Road Safety Strategies each covering periods of a decade. Critical national advocacy groups already exist, including the Australasian College of Road Safety, ANCAP, and the Australian Automobile Association (AAA). In addition, the states, territories, and Commonwealth Governments agreed to create the National Road Safety Council (NRSC), an independent body working at the national level for road safety, but with funding from all the jurisdictions. This paper identifies advantages of this body in advancing road safety, and considers the best ways for the NRSC to move forward. Key advantages of the NRSC include: (1) independence of commentary from Government and credibility as an unbiased advocacy group (unlike the Government experts in each jurisdiction who are often presented in the media as simply defending the Governments position rather than bringing evidence based expertise); (2) independence from the pressure of the views of members (which may sometimes limit the evidence basis of road safety positions of motoring clubs); and (3) the funding base, which while small in comparison with the jurisdictions, is still large compared with other independent voices such as the ACRS. The NRSC has three strategic advantages that it aims to capture: (1) by purchasing materials or processes for national use it captures efficiencies over each state conducting its own purchase process; (2) as an independent voice the NRSC can advocate courageous actions, helping the political process, applying pressure for national uniformity, and encouraging stronger decision making through the knowledge that the other states are doing it and the feeling that 'I am not alone in this'; (3) the NRSC has sufficient funds to trial some promising programs and conduct key pieces of research. Examples of these are identified from the activities of the NRSC to date, including the funding of materials, advocacy to the media, and the trialling of programs.	[Job, R. F.

For this end, qualitative approach has been employed to gather the data required. The findings obtained reveal that the university anti-HIV/AIDS movements have become dependent on print media which were provided by NGOs and GOs for communicating their goals though the campaign against HIV/AIDS requires multidimensional tools. Unable to integrate other communication approaches such as broadcast media and internet has made the movements to fail to achieve the desired goals set as an end. The movements' lack of clear strategic plan has also contributed its own role for the movements not to be successful in their attempt to fight the pandemic. Moreover, lack of commitment on the part of the management of the university, infrequent trainings and other social events, lack of coordination and financial problems have highly hindered the movements' communication works. Thus, the findings have clearly revealed that communication has been downplayed in the movements' attempts to fight the epidemic. Because of this, behavior change in BDU is still unattainable goal. To alleviate the problem, it is highly recommended that a clear strategic plan needs to be designed in the way it directs clear, appropriate and integrated communication approaches, employing both mass media and non mass media outlets in addition to interpersonal communication for effective communication works.

J	Dina, IS; Irina, PKS				Dina, Spicheva, I; Irina, Kuzheleva-Sagan P.			IMAGE AS INSTRUMENT FOR ''GENERATION Y'' CONSCIOUSNESS AND BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						image; control; communication; ''Generation Y''; network society; new media		Modern youth or, the so called 'Generation Y', has become the most active social subject of network information-communication society. It happened due to fast development of technologies and new media and also to 'natural' interest of young people in everything new. Unlike other social groups which use new media, youth is involved in social processes based on a particular type of information. It is image-based information which is managed by nature as it actualizes certain stereotypes and grounds for reputation in young people's consciousness. It brings into focus parallels with standards of behavior accepted in the society and current trends (in fashion, pop-culture, etc). From socio-philosophical point of view, image is one of symbolic assets (P. Bourdieu) which is represented in 'formulated' (stereotyped, processable) attitude of a subject towards the reality. This attitude determines one's behavior in accordance with the basic values of the society. From socio-psychological point, image is a form and a result of implementing of three functions typical for modern and ancient people: 1) identification (recognition) by a subject of somebody or something among similar objects; 2) self-identification of a subject (determining one's own 'common' and unique characteristics); 3) self-presentation (acknowledged demonstration of one's 'similarity' or 'particularity' (C. Jung). The authors believe that implementation of all the functions occurs simultaneously on three levels of symbolic managerial (imagebased) communication: emotional-evaluative, ethical-aesthetic, and value-objective. The first level allows perceiving and evaluating information applying to subconscious emotional-sensual experience of a managing subject. The second level applies to some aesthetic images and standards of behavior accepted in the society. The third level is about accepting and demonstrating some social status which corresponds to objectives and values of a subject. It is possible to suggest that the described mechanism of image functioning as an instrument for managing consciousness and behavior of 'network' and 'non-network' youth is universal. However, digital technologies and new media provide with unlimited opportunities for gaining symbolic assets and for self-actualization of 'Generation Y' representatives. They also intensify the managerial resource of the image-based communication. As a result, 'Generation Y' becomes more and more manageable and programmed by the basic subjects of the strategic (J. Habermas) image-based communication even though young people feel more and more 'free' in virtual space. This is one of the major problems of network informationcommunication society, which requires great socio-philosophical reflection.

J	Igor, AK				Igor, Kochev A.			GERMANY'S ROLE IN EU MILITARY MISSION ''EUFOR CONGO''	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						Germany; CSDP; European Union; security policy; Congo		It is well known that the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) of the European Union (EU) is an intergovernmental component of European integration. It means that the CSDP is determined by the EU member states. Therefore understanding of the CDSP is conditioned by the understanding of the different member states positions. Many scholars argue that Germany being an EU driving force plays a leading role in the CSDP too. The author revises this thesis by analyzing German foreign-policy behavior during one of the practical ESDP challenges - the EU military mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, EUFOR RD Congo (2006). He finds out whether the mission met German national interests, to what degree Germany participated in the agenda-setting and decision-making process, what Germany's military and financial contribution was. The author comes to a conclusion that Germany's role in the operation was twofold. On the one hand, it proved itself as a real leader nation by assuming the responsibility for planning and strategic management of the mission as well as contributing 1/3 of the military contingent and covering 1/5 of the expenses incurred. On the other hand, a practical dimension demonstrated Germany's weak points and secondary role played in the CSDP. The Congo mission was put on the European agenda by France and Belgium, not Germany. In contrast to the both ex-colonial powers, EUFOR RD Congo was not in Germany's national interest, but in spite of this Berlin got involved in the mission. The formal leadership and military participation resulted solely from the strong diplomatic and informal pressure exerted by partners. At the same time Germany's internal political controversy and difficult procedural questions considerably restrained preparation for the operation, threatened with its frustration and thereupon blocked its logical prolongation. German headquarters in Potsdam faced difficulties in planning and coordination of EUFOR RD Congo. German armed forces had problems with supplies and training of personnel, its practical contribution to general success was minimal - inter alia owing to the national limitations of its application geography. The author concludes, that partners' as well as some scholars' expectations in relation to Germany's contribution to the CSDP are higher than German political willingness and real military potential.

J	Iida, Y; Murata, H; Kamata, S				Iida, Yoshitaka; Murata, Hideto; Kamata, Seiichi			General Design Information Management System: PLEMIA	FUJITSU SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL JOURNAL			English	Article								PLEMIA is a tool that realizes a management solution concept for Fujitsu's product lifecycle management (PLM). A PLM solution is a general strategic solution to build a next-generation development design and fabrication environment from the planning stage of a product to its design, development, manufacturing spot, sale, support, disposal and recycling. PLEMIA collectively manages product-related information of the whole lifecycle of a product by using information and communications technology (ICT). It is a strong tool realizing a flexible manufacturing system which can adapt to changes in the market environment via support from the upstream areas of the design process. PLEMIA makes it possible to have design support from a product's concept phase via engineering data management, product configuration management via a bill of materials (BOM) system, and efficient process management. In addition, introducing PLEMIA brings the following merits: safe team design, a general BOM system, and visibility of the processes conducted by designers and managers, effective use of information assets through diversified search functions and document data that can be shared in the process flow. This paper describes PLEMIA's development policy and a plan to enhance it.

PBM is defined as "a systematic approach to performance improvement through an ongoing process of establishing strategic performance objectives, measuring performance, collecting, analyzing, reviewing, and reporting performance data, and using that data to drive performance improvement"(Performance Management Handbook). A questionnaire was conducted, with respect to the presence or absence of barriers to implementation of performance-based management at pharmacies along the East-West corridor of Trinidad. A twenty-two (22) question survey was administered to sixteen (16) pharmacies to be assessed. This region was chosen because of its close proximity and convenience. Fourteen (14) of the twenty-two (22) questions were based on a Likert-type scale, so that respondents were able to specify their level of agreement or disagreement of applicability on a symmetric "strongly agree-strongly disagree" scale for a series of statements based on the barriers of PBM implementation. Pharmacies were selected in a non-randomized manner. The SPSS statistical computer software was used to estimate a model that would best describe the barriers to the implementation of PBM in pharmacies of Trinidad. While Performance Based Management (PBM) is implemented in various pharmacies throughout Trinidad, it is usually found in those of larger companies with more staff employed and also with the infrastructure and funding available to support this type of management. Since most pharmacies operate with smaller staff, most aspects of PBM are not practised but this does not mean that the management are unaware of PBM. Some pharmacists and pharmacy owners have expressed intentions of employing PBM in the future and do follow some of its practices such as employee documentation and giving performance feedback. However with the many barriers to PBM existing, this type of management may seem too cumbersome for most businesses to implement fully. Although, PBM may not be fully implemented in pharmacies, (especially smaller businesses) if most pharmacy owners do not adapt to changes in the business settings they may not reap the full benefits that come with performance management.

Literature has shown that certain store attributes are important strategic differentiation tools for grocery retailers. A retail atmosphere can lead to success or failure of a business. Previous studies have neglected the current trend to the coexistence of different retail formats, under different brands but within the same organization. In these cases, a multi-banner company needs to customize the atmosphere to its customers in order to gain attention. This research is about the influence of the store format on the servicescape of the grocery retail stores. A survey was conducted of 302 hyper and supermarket customers. A range of atmospherics variables were considered, including some less studied, such as temperature and cleanliness. The results show that all the dependent variables are sensitive to store format, except cleanliness.

Learning games combine two industries: education and entertainment, which is often called "Edutainment." The game is realized as a strategic game (similar to Risk T), implemented as a module for Moodle CMS, utilizing Java Applet technology. Moodle is an open-source course management system (CMS), which is widely used among universities as an eLearning platform. Java Applet enables development of rich-client applications which are executed in web browser environment. During the game, players receive questions from specified Moodle quiz, and all answers are stored back into Moodle system. Students can later verify their score and answers, and examine the test that they actually worked on during the game. This system supports synchronous as well as asynchronous interaction between players.

INTRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF INSTITUTION OF ASSESSMENT OF REGULATORY IMPACT AT FORMATION AND REALIZATION OF STATE POLIC	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						state policy; regulatory impact assessment; public administration		As the state policy as a system includes measures of legislative, executive and supervising character, there is a topical problem of distribution of assessment of regulating impact not only on creation of regulatory legal acts, but also on all the process of making and implementation of the political decision. For this purpose it is necessary to provide: 1. Assessment of correctness of identification of the problem (structure, hierarchy, etc.) the policy is to solve, to estimate the degree of accounting for the interests of the parties and possibility of achievement of consensus between them to provide empirical data for a choice of alternative solutions of the existing problem. 2. Assessment of efficiency of functioning and coordination of interaction of institutions that realize the state policy, diagnostics of existing normative legal acts on their compliance with the strategic objective and the priority directions of the developed policy at various levels of public administration. It will provide complementarity and integration of strategic documents and program of special-purpose character directed at realization of a state policy. 3. Assessment of the established borders of tolerances, the indicators characterizing realization of policy, offered correcting measures in the presence of interested parties and experts at their discussion. 4. Assessment of commensurability of expenses and consequences of a realized state policy: straight lines and indirect effects, productivity, efficiency of the programs realized by the state. The regulatory impact assessment application at formalization of a state policy will allow to consider features of the existing institutional environment, to reveal integration processes in various groups of society, to provide an effective information exchange (by means of feedback formation), to define interested parties and their relation to measures of a carried-out state policy. Identification of organizational and social mechanisms of interaction of business, the power and society at formation and realization of a state policy will promote development of the theory of the collective action connected with control and resource management, being in the general property and being object of the state regulating influence. The assessment of standard and legal, executive and control measures of a carried-out state policy, and also introduction of practice of private and collective arbitration behind their observance are necessary. In the subsequent it will allow to provide coordination of interests of subjects of a state policy and their associations, to plan distribution of resources between these subjects, to expect to regulate social and economic processes and to get public support of a realized state policy.

However, lack of in-depth understanding about the issue and practical tools to support management persists. IC research in the case of NPO's is still rather generic and conceptual. This paper makes a contribution by describing the practices of IC management in this particular context. The paper describes one possible approach to recognize the key intangibles of non-profit organizations. This approach was applied in three case organizations in order to illustrate the significance of IC from the viewpoint of value creation in services. More generally, the paper illustrates first, the necessity to concretize the strategic perspectives of IC management and second, the need for measurement tools that enable the monitoring of IC.

J	Arnaud, C; Soldo, E; Keramidas, O				Arnaud, Charlene; Soldo, Edina; Keramidas, Olivier			Renewal of Territorial Governance Through Cultural Events: Case Study of the Picasso-Aix 2009 Cultural Season	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cultural event; territory; governance; proximity; inter-organizational arenas	TOURISM; MANAGEMENT; PROXIMITY; IMPACTS	In France since the 1980s, decentralization has increased the skills, budgets and autonomy of local authorities, which has resulted in the emergence of true territorial strategic management. Behind this new sharing of power between public and private actors lies the challenge of stakeholder management. Some areas are clearly regulated (the social sector, urban and rural planning and development), while others remain in a state of confusion. This raises the question of the extent to which cultural events can be activators of territorial proximity, understood as a strong territorial governance system. The authors analyze the effects of one event, Picasso-Aix 2009, on the Greater Aix-en-Provence Community Council in the South of France through 65 semi-structured interviews with the event's stakeholders. They offer an interpretative framework for analyzing the impact of cultural events on territorial governance.

J	Davis, SM; Sarkani, S; Mazzuchi, T				Davis, Santia M.; Sarkani, Shahram; Mazzuchi, Thomas			A Systematic Approach to Identifying Engineering Generational Knowledge Transfer Boundaries	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge transfer; generational knowledge transfer; knowledge transfer boundaries		As organisations evaluate increasing retirement rates coupled with the rate of entering engineers, there is a need to address the presence of generational knowledge transfer boundaries. These unidentified boundaries impede the strategic transfer of engineering and architectural knowledge (STEAK) required for continued engineering growth. Using an interdisciplinary approach to define the engineering generational knowledge transfer boundaries provided useful knowledge sharing characteristics and procedures which all generations and disciplines can utilise. This research study provided a level of insight not previously explored and presented a model that can be used to evaluate how organisations will react to and leverage the knowledge across generations. Specifically, this study helps close the generational knowledge transfer boundary research gap with proper identification of the engineering generational knowledge transfer boundaries. This will allow management to propose strategies to attract and retain the next generation of knowledge workers. The article discusses these findings in detail and summarises the results in a proposed STEAK model and framework.

Case study of 863 Plan of China	JCOM-JOURNAL OF SCIENCE COMMUNICATION			English	Article								Improving communications between scientists and policy makers have being received more and more attention in China. Based on negotiation-boundary work theory (Jasanoff,1990),this paper presents an analysis of the interface between scientists and policy makers by drawing on the Strategic High-tech Research and Development Program of China (863 Program). The analysis indicates, first, that it is very important of science advice in China, the negotiation and the consensus between scientists and policy makers is vital for policy making; second, that it is dangerous to rely on Technocracy in China, the policy makers give up the discretion while influence experts' decisions by controlling the consist of scientist advisory committee, which directly result in politicalizing academic research. For scientists and policy makers in China, they should redefine their respective authority boundary, and make the interaction process open and transparent.

Using the game theory principles we focus on Google's internet search operations in China, particularly information dissemination decisions, and we examine how Google's decisions affect the corporation's success on the Chinese market, which is additionally determined by the information regulation policy of the Chinese authorities. In view of the fact that goals of Google and Chinese authorities are partially overlapping and partially conflicting this perfect information game contains both competitive and cooperative elements. In this paper we will argue that for Google or any other company in the equal situation the best strategic choice would be to respect and follow the laws and restrictions set by the authorities of the country in which the company chooses to operate. Finally, an analysis is completed through determining the optimal strategy for Google and Chinese authorities and finding the equilibrium point.

J	Pearman, GI				Pearman, G. I.			A commentary on the climate change issue	AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						climate change; risk management; greenhouse gas emissions; human behaviour; sustainable business	LEVEL; SCIENCE	The climate is changing and the balance of scientific evidence indicates a human contribution through increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases, continued emissions of which will lead to further climate change. Hence, there is an issue to manage through both reducing net greenhouse gas emissions and implementing adaptation strategies. This is not about scientific certainty but probability and risk management. Timely responses to this challenge are somewhat thwarted; first, because policy developers receive relevant knowledge about climate change largely through ad hoc processes open to unintended barriers and manipulation and, second, because behavioural characteristics such as subjectiveness, short-sightedness and irrationality are barriers to the acceptance of a need for action. Businesses that see future opportunities in a low-carbon society, or have an ethos of sustainability, might consider the value of being early starters; strategic and flexible; using expert knowledge and building technological skill; and spreading risk through a portfolio approach. Climate change reflects the way we are as individuals, our expectations, culture, history, education, and our institutional structures, market economy, governance, shared behavioural norms and legal frameworks. There is a need to reassess the foundation of these characteristics in light of the climate change issue.	[Pearman, G. I.] Graeme Pearman Consulting Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Pearman, G.
