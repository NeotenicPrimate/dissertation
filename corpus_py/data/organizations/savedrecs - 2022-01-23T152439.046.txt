J	Caetano, M; Schnetzler, JP; Amaral, DC				Caetano, Mauro; Schnetzler, Juliana Pereira; Amaral, Daniel Capaldo			Partnerships Incorporation in the Innovation Strategic Planning as a Technology Push Integration Strategy	REVISTA GESTAO & TECNOLOGIA-JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY			Portuguese	Article						Open Innovation; Partners; Technology Planning		The technology planning methods are one of the solutions to key issues related to innovation process, as the implementation of open innovation strategy and the technology roadmapping, TRM. Some of these methods provide a systematic approach to technology planning, however they have neglected the adoption of partnerships and open innovation. The current work fills this gap including the partnership in technology planning as an important guideline. However, these theories usually do not present procedures or directions about how to identify and plan these partnerships. This paper presents a systematic approach to identify and plan the partnership in technology planning. From a literature review perspective and action research, a specific procedure was developed for the adoption of partners in technology planning, considering different types of partners, as well as the objectives of the partnerships in the innovation process in accordance with the necessary resources: whether for market, technological or financial purposes. The results show that the procedure is useful not only for the organization under study, but also to support distinct innovation planning initiatives.

This always makes the Japanese sweets a high level in Kyoto, and gets the high appraisal from the parties concerned the master of the tea ceremony, such as "Urasenke." In this study, we present an analysis of Suetomi's management strategy and its strength and differentiation based on an interview with the president, Mr. Yamaguchi. Then, we analyze their innovation from the viewpoint of product innovation and affective value (i.e., sense value). Finally, we discuss the innovation of the Kyogashi design based on our research. In conclusion, Suetomi has a different strong point from the other company as a long-standing company of Kyoto confections and we have understood performing the management strategy which establishes a sustainable competitive advantage using it. Thus, they have performed the design innovation of Kyoto confections products in the management strategy which is compatible in tradition and innovation, and have created the value of a customer's sensitivity.

J	Langer, H				Langer, Howard			Pricing from the trenches: The evolution of pricing practice in a home improvement retailer	JOURNAL OF REVENUE AND PRICING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						retail pricing; retail price optimisation; home improvement pricing; managing pricing teams		With intense pressure on margins arising from the twin attack of rising costs and suppressed demand, it is still surprising to see only a small number of retailers using price as a powerful tool to reach their operational and strategic goals. This article sets out the practical principles used in the author's time leading the Pricing Team in a leading Home Improvement retailer to manage prices over a 5-year period. It charts the progress from a manual approach through to price optimisation and describes the organisational challenges on route. This article is written to detail the practical techniques used and their applications and provides thoughts on how to nurture and grow a pricing programme learning from challenges faced from within the organisation.

J	Lee, HC; Herawan, T; Noraziah, A				Lee, Ho; Herawan, Tutut; Noraziah, A.			Product Design Generation and Decision Making Through Strategic Integration of Evolutionary Grammars and Kano Model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Customer Satisfaction; Decision Making; Evolutionary Grammars; Evolutionary Grammars (EG)-Kano Reference Model; Genetic Programming; Kano Model; Non-Linear Product Design Analysis; Product and Engineering Design; Product Design Strategies		The ability for a product developer to successfully launch useful products is tied to the company's product design strategies. Due to the complexity of perception and expectations on new product design from customers and the diverse perspectives of the product developer, any approaches without systematically analyzing these complex criteria to assess decision making on product design strategies are therefore deemed as inappropriate. A systematic approach to determine appropriate product design strategies based on the attributes of product design and customer expectations should thus be considered. This research focuses on the investigation of shape formulation process using evolutionary grammars (EG) and non-linear product design analysis with Kano model to refine product design strategies. Through the strategic integration of evolutionary grammars and Kano model, the complex effects on the evolutionary design process and product design strategies are revealed. In order to demonstrate the viability of the approach, experiments are described and a comparison analysis on three EG-Kano reference models is performed. Upon determining the appropriate EG-Kano reference model, the product developer can refine the product design strategies to suit the targeted market.

Selling in channels with uncertain price	JOURNAL OF REVENUE AND PRICING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						revenue management; price uncertainty; price cannibalization; dynamic programming; strategic timing; inventory release		In this article, we analyze the problem of selling through channels where the sales price and hence revenue is uncertain. Examples of such channels include real estate listings, traditional and online auctions, name-your-own-price channels and price guarantees. More specifically, we consider a seller, with a fixed inventory, who has to decide when to make items available to the market. We assume that there is a holding or depreciation cost associated with the items, which means that the seller would like to make items available for sale as soon as possible. On the other hand, we also assume that the expected selling price is decreasing in the number of items made available to the market. That is, there is a price cannibalization effect among the items made available at the same time, resulting in an incentive to make items available sequentially over time. We formulate the problem as a discrete time Markov Decision Problem and consider two cases: guaranteed successful sales and possibly unsuccessful sales. The reason for considering the two cases is that they require different analyses and give rise to different results. The article focuses on the case when the seller only has two items, which has sufficient complexity to raise interesting insights and challenging questions.

J	Orros, GC; Smith, J				Orros, G. C.; Smith, J.			Enterprise risk management for health insurance from an actuarial perspective	BRITISH ACTUARIAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Enterprise risk management; Strategic risks; Risk and uncertainty; Governance; Risk appetite; Health insurance; Healthcare providers; NHS		This paper focuses on Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and strategic business management for health insurance companies in our world of 'unknown unknowns' and the emergence of unexpected risks over time. It illustrates how Chief Risk Officers (CROs) can focus on 'risk and opportunity management' through an ERM framework, and thereby balance risks against opportunities, whilst being resilient against 'unknown unknowns' and their emergence over time as 'known unknowns' and 'known knowns'. The paper has been designed to meet the broad requirements of health insurers that would like to implement an ERM framework for the effective risk management of their health insurance lines of business. Risk management for health insurers in the context of Solvency II and broader European Commission regulatory requirements is also discussed. The authors discuss how insurers can develop and apply risk management to build resilience in the face of the storms and shocks that may lie ahead.	[Orros, G.

Although the potential impacts of climate change on agriculture production have been widely discussed at national and regional scales, little research at provincial scale has been reported. Moreover, most of previous researches did not take into consideration of the non-climatic factors, which led to the uncertainties of the results. However, it is necessary to analyze the influence of climate change on crop yields with combination considering non-climatic factors. In this study, climatic data and crop yield over the period 1959-2008 in Northeast China (NC) were used to investigate the response of the rice (Oryza saliva L.) yields to recent climatic trends. To better understanding the role of human adaptation in mitigating the effect of climate change on agriculture, the Household Responsibility System (HRS), one of major human adaptive measures to climate change, was considered. The results showed that rice yields increased by 2.8% as the warming trend in growing season minimum temperature in northeast region of China over the recent decades, and this Finding further confirmed earlier researches indicating that the rice yield was positively correlated with the climatic change in the growing season. Different response patterns of rice yields to recent climate change at provincial and regional scales over different study time period were detected. The contribution of climate change to rice yield in NC declined from 23% in pre-HRS (before the HRS: 1960-1984) to 7% in post-HRS (after the HRS: 1985-2008), which means that the influence of climate change on rice yields could be weakened as the adaptation capacity of human beings gradually increases, and the effect of non-climatic factors on yield fluctuation may be enhanced.

SUPPLY CHAIN RESTRUCTURING THEORY	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						restructuring; logistics; supply chain; anti-crisis instrument		External environment instability makes it necessary to monitor supply chain elements interactions constantly. At some point it causes business process restructuring. Supply chain restructuring theory is based on symbiosis of logistics and restructuring theories. Integral and optimizing character of logistics makes it methodological development base for action complex connected with successive supply chain restructuring. On the assumption of the existing approaches to supply chain economic essence and keeping in mind the specific character of implementation of restructuring procedures to the elements of this organizational form a new concept of supply chain restructuring logistics system (SCRLS) is formulated. It means the aggregate of restructuring process elements connected with each other and with external environment, which operate in order to achieve general goals by effective organization and management of economic flows. Strategic goal of SCRLS for economic players connected in supply chain is competitiveness increase of all participants. The following objects are achieved: management system improvement of all parts of the chain, creation of adequate financial policy, rationalization of operational, HR, marketing and sales methods. Economic flows management during supply chain restructuring provides purposeful approach. In this situation identifying of logistics restructuring effectiveness is based on evaluation of system's output parameters. They appear as results of implemented restructuring strategy. Goals and costs analysis of effectiveness has shown the importance of a complex approach towards supply chain restructuring. Economic flows organization and management within SCRLS provides correcting actions where and when it is necessary. It is important to work out business process monitoring algorithm including: current state diagnostics, results analysis and improvement caused by economic flows changes (with prognosis) measurements, plan of corrections. This becomes a kind of regulations for economic flows, which appear, change and absorb in the system. SCRLS is an anti-crisis tool of business-process management as logistics works to increase organizational and economic stability of supply chains. Moreover, implementation of logistics principles gives an opportunity to optimize management decisions, choose the most convenient and the least risky restructuring plan.

Strategic analysis of the obstetric and gynaecological internship in Sudan	SUDAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Internship; preregistration medical graduates duties; house-officers; obstetrics an gynaecology; medical education; medical responsibility		Background: The high expectations of the increasingly questioning society lays a great burden on the first line treating doctors in Sudan. This is particularly true in the obstetrics and gynaecology departments. The impact of training of the house-officer in surgical departments was not studied before in Sudan. The aim: To evaluate the gains in knowledge and skills of house-officers in the obstetrics and gynaecology departments as reflected by their activities and their opinions. Methodology: A prospective cohort carried in the period from May 2011 through June 2011. The data was collected from 200 house-officers. Their activities and duties as formulated by their seniors and supervisors and gains in knowledge and skills were noted. Results: All house-officers participated actively in the clinical diagnosis (history, physical examination and relevant investigations) and management of cases of antepartum and postpartum haemorrhages. Of them 186(93%) had duties not more than twice a week. However, 121(60.5%) shared training opportunities in units having seven or less peers. Also, 109(54.5%) had regular seminars and tutorials. In practice, 165(82.5%) performed evacuations, 158(79%) participated in normal deliveries, and 110(55%) were assisted in performing caesarean sections. Conclusion: The overall performance of house-officers in the department of obstetrics and gynaecology in Sudan is good. However, standards of training need to revisited to fill gabs in training if these young doctors are to be dispatched to rural hospital immediately after the internship period.

J	Lee, PC				Lee, Po-Ching			EMPIRICAL STUDY ON THE DIGITAL CONVERGENCE STRATEGY AND PATENT ACTIVITY OF TAIWANESE MEDIA GROUPS	NTUT JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Digital convergence; media; patent; UDN Group; Want Want China Times Group		This study explores the strategy, innovative approach and patent activity of the UDN Group and the Want Want China Times Group, two of the largest media groups in Taiwan, in the digital convergence era. In the era of digital convergence, drastic changes to industry boundaries and media positioning have exposed media groups to the risk of patent infringement. The groups with larger end-user market will probably become the patentee's target for charging royalties. However, neither of the two groups views patent rights as a strategic asset in either R&D or acquisition. Patent rights are not highly valued by the media industry in Taiwan. Therefore, it is imperative for media groups to consider patent risk and infringement liability when developing new products and services or when outsourcing technology. This study recommends that the leader in content service should monitor closely patents and develop a patent portfolio that focuses on data conversion, and cross-media data transmission and presentation. This type of portfolio may serve as a defensive measure in the short-term and as a patent niche to differentiate itself from other media groups in the long-term.

With this approach, the voltage swing on the channel for reliable sensing can be reduced, resulting in performance improvement in terms of power consumption, peak current, and delay spread due to PVT variations, as compared to the conventional repeater insertion schemes. Evaluation for on-chip interconnects having various lengths in a 130 nm CMOS process indicated that the proposed on-chip interconnect scheme achieved a power reduction of up to 71.3%. The peak current during data transmission and the delay spread due to PVT variations were also reduced by as much as 52.1% and 65.3%, respectively.

J	Poulsen, RT; Weehrens, BV; Nielsen, AP				Poulsen, Rene Taudal; Weehrens, Brian Vejrum; Nielsen, Anders Paarup			Global Shifts in Marine Manufacturing, 1950-2010: A Case for the Onshore Expansion of Maritime History	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MARITIME HISTORY			English	Article								This paper presents a case for the expansion of the scope of maritime history to include marine equipment manufacturers. Such companies have received little attention from maritime historians even though they have played key roles in supplying shipbuilders and shipping companies. By studying the development of the manufacturing strategies within marine equipment suppliers, maritime historians can shed new light on global shifts within manufacturing and maritime industries during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Moreover, they can contribute new insights to other research traditions within strategic and operations management and question theoretical models developed in these traditions. The paper presents a case study on the history of Novenco, a manufacturer of marine equipment, which is at odds with a widely quoted model on manufacturing strategy developed by management professor Kasra Ferdows. The paper analyzes how Novenco's manufacturing strategy evolved from 1950 to 2010 and examines how the company responded to global shifts in its main markets.

An oligopoly output competition model was therefore developed between FDI enterprises and host country enterprises, with a conjectural variable introduced to weigh up the cooperation level between relevant enterprises, thus simulating and analyzing the location choice behavior of the agglomeration of home-country FDI. It was found that foreign enterprises will locate in the medium or small city which has a certain agglomeration effect when foreign investment enterprises can constitute the strategic alliance to cooperate their yield incompletely. The less degree enterprises cooperate their yield is, the bigger agglomeration effect that the location of foreign capital enterprises requests.

A DYNAMIC APPROACH TO IMPROVING THE EXECUTION OF DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES FOR DATE-RELATED INDUSTRIES IN IRAN, BASED ON HYBRID GRA AND ISM METHODS	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							PERFORMANCE	This paper presents a hybrid Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) and Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) methodology for appropriate dynamic analysis, in order to improve the execution of development strategies for date-related industries in Iran. The proposed framework consists of four main phases: (1) establishment of strategies; (2) GRA analysis; (3) binary comparison to determine hierarchy levels using the ISM method; and (4) dynamic analysis. The analysis reveals that the strategic priorities to improve Iran's date industries can be arranged on three levels. The first level consists of the by-products of date packing and processing. On the second level, three tactics are determined: developing ready-for-use date products, deriving date fruit products, and fermentation of products. The third level is to blend dates with other foods and palm products (excluding dates).

Rapid technological development and the demands of knowledgeable customers have made growth more difficult for manufacturers. We assume that the practices of long-established manufacturers are best for others to follow. Toraya has been a high-value-added confectioner for almost 500 years. The reasons for its sustained competitiveness are described in this paper. We use the 3Cs analysis to clarify the business circumstances of the Japanese confection industry, the 4Ps analysis to explore Toraya's structure, the strategic experimental module analysis to show the reliable value that Toraya offers its customers, and the Value, Rarity, Inimitability, and Organization analysis to explain its long-term success. The results reveal that Toraya has employed a low-technology strategy utilizing artisanal skill instead of machines and provides an excellent consumer experience that attracts customers. This is a sustainable competitive advantage because it takes years to establish and is not easily imitated. However, Toraya's simple and effective management practices could be adopted as industry best practices.

An investigation on underground transport roads and influence on safety and productivity at Khutala Colliery	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article						road construction; maintenance; strategic road design		The purpose of the project was to investigate the challenges faced by Khutala Colliery pertaining to underground road construction and maintenance. Furthermore the influence of these challenges on productivity and safety requirements were taken into consideration. The operating standards required for the construction and maintenance of the 2 seam road transport infrastructure was investigated, together with reasons why the standards of operating procedure are not met. The Code of Practice put in place by Khutala Colliery was used to view the standard operating procedures. Leading practices on underground road construction were researched. The project aims to discover the gaps that Khutala Colliery must bridge to implement enhanced practices with regards to underground road construction. During the period of study, observations were carried out to determine whether the road construction standards of operating procedure were being adhered to at all times for both road construction and road maintenance. Khutala Colliery has put in place a traffic management plan, which includes safety practices and work policies that must be adhered to while travelling on underground transport roads.

J	Shah, S				Shah, Shashank			Proposing a Welfare Framework for the Society and Local Community Stakeholders: A Mixed Method Study	JOURNAL OF HUMAN VALUES			English	Article						Society; local community; stakeholder welfare; corporate social responsibility; society and local community welfare framework; CSR in India		In India, society and social welfare has always been an important part of business and its broad objectives. From Merchant Charity to Corporate Citizenship, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has undergone a lot of change over the past many centuries. Whatever be the nomenclature, the objective remains the same-ensuring the welfare of the society and local community as an important stakeholder of an organization. While many companies use CSR as a strategic tool, many others undertake CSR activities for genuine altruism. In both cases, CSR can be a very powerful tool for inclusive growth-the need of the hour. In this article, an attempt has been made through a mixed method study of proposing a Society and Local Community Welfare Framework. The quantitative data is gathered through an Executive Perception Survey wherein 400 responses from 125 organizations were gained and statistical analyses of the same were undertaken by the author. The qualitative data was gathered through personal interactions with senior management executives from nine eminent corporate organizations across industry categories. The framework and its major components are thus based on empirical data of practices as existent in corporate India today. Thus, the framework could be considered as a working model of CSR in India.

J	Tynjala, T				Tynjala, Teemu			Validation in Supply Chain Decision Support Systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Decision Support Systems - DSS; Finance; Industry; Operations Management; Supply Chain Management		Decision Support Systems are used currently to support various high impact decisions in industry. This study explores the subcategory of DSSs related to Supply Chain Management. More precisely we explore the problem of integrating companies' strategic supply chain decision support systems to financial reporting systems for the purpose of validation. The study is done through literature survey, and inductive case studies. The author finds that integration is challenging because systems are typically disjoint and capture data at different levels of granularity. The author conceptualizes the present problem and proposes a generic solution framework.

Strategic analysis of the surgical internship in Sudan	SUDAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Preregistration medical graduates duties; house-officers; medical education; medical responsibility		Background: The internship period is internationally recognized the prerequisite official essential training period for the medical graduates to get registered in the local licensing body; in Sudan being the Sudan Medical Council. The evaluation of this important period was not studied before in Sudan. Objectives: To evaluate the performance of house-officers as reflected by their activities and opinions of their supervisors. Methodology: A prospective qualitative study in the period May 2011 through June 2011. The data was collected from 246 house-officers. Their activities, duties as formulated by their seniors and supervisors together with the relevant aspects of the working environment and their aspirations were noted. Results: A total of 106 (53%) were trained in surgical units having seven or less peers. 118(59%) have worked in surgical units under supervision of surgical registrars and consultants. 157 (78.5%) had duties once or more/week. 129 (64.5%) house-surgeons had regular seminars and tutorials. 163 (81.5%) gained experience in wound suturing. 177 (88.5%) house-surgeons were exposed to clinical diagnoses and management of cases of acute abdomen but, 134 (67%) were able to perform various numbers of appendicectomies. 88(44%) of house-officers had a chance to open or close a vertical midline laparotomy wounds and 140 (70%) had chance to apply a plaster of Paris Conclusion: The overall performance of house-surgeons in Sudan as reflected by their activities and opinions is good. However, protocols and guidelines of practice, structure of the training should be made clear before starting the surgical internship.

J	Kanatas, G; Qi, JP				Kanatas, George; Qi, Jianping			COMPETITION AND MANAGERIAL INCENTIVES: BOARD INDEPENDENCE, INFORMATION AND PREDATION	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECONOMICS			English	Article							CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; DETERMINANTS; SIZE	We show that the choice of an independent board serves as a commitment by management that it will abstain from ex post decisions that are not in shareholder interests. However, an independent board, relying on product market information to make or approve strategic decisions, also makes the firm more vulnerable to predatory information manipulation by its industry rivals. The optimal board type trades off the cost of the agency problem with that from predation. We show that only for weaker firms is an independent board the better choice, and for such firms, increased competition makes board independence even more beneficial.

And IT equipments have many risks both in software and hardware aspects after the service is expired (called End of Service), even if it can be used more. It makes us realize that one of the fundamental characteristics of the IT equipments is to have economical use according to the maintenance service. It should therefore be managed life cycle from a point of view of economical use and replacement; renewal of a service contract or migrating to new equipments smoothly. This paper aims at efficient replacement management for the IT equipments based on economic life and risk of failure which are widely used in engineering economy.

J	Smirnov, VP				Smirnov, Vladimir P.			METHODOLOGICAL BASES OF ENTERPRISE ACTIVITY	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						methodology; enterprise activity; entrepreneurship; structure		Entrepreneurship is one of strategic resources and an internal source of national economy development. The role of entrepreneurship essentially increases in the conditions of transition to the innovative type of economic development. Preconditions of effective realization of enterprise activity are revealing and accounting of its methodological bases. But for a variety of reasons the problem of methodology of enterprise activity is developed in an insufficient degree. Entrepreneurial is the practical productive (sometimes reproductive) economic activity, conducted independently, on one's risk, directed at achievement of objectively new or subjectively new results with the purpose of achievement of personal benefit and public advantage. Methodology of enterprise activity is the doctrine about structure, organizations, methods and means of such economic activity of people. Revealing of methodological bases of enterprise activity means definition of its basic characteristics, principles, resources, conditions, factors, norms, and logic, the process and time structures. The basic characteristics of enterprise activity include the attributes inherent in any labour activity, and also features or peculiarities of enterprise activity. Enterprise activity is organised on principles of hierarchy, integrity, openness, historicity, and necessary variety. Enterprise activity is characterized with resources, which are money, labour, equipment, technical equipment, materials, technology, information, space, and time. Resources become factors of enterprise activity, elements of enterprise capital in case of their targeted use. The external and internal environments define the conditions of enterprise activity. The activity of the businessman is regulated by the legal and ethical standards, customs of entrepreneurship existing in the society. Attributes of enterprise activity, as well as any other expedient human activity, are self-control and management. Enterprise activity has a complex, multilevel structure. By consideration of the logic structure of enterprise activity the philosophical understanding of the subject, object, subject matter, forms, means, methods, and result of activity is used. At the process level the components of the enterprise activity structure are the needs, motive, purpose, problems, technology, action, result, united in a system by self-control and management. In the time structure of enterprise activity, there are phases consisting of stages, which, in turn, consist of periods.

The first is that the methodology for determining institutional framework for this purpose must rely on the concept and elements defined in the key document for the Europeanization of spatial development - ESDP (European Spatial Development Perspective: Toward Balanced and Sustainable Development of the EU). Second, its task is to create conditions for the implementation of active strategies of versions of reindustrialization of Serbia, with a focus on creating an enabling surrounding for the export business and private investments in mid and high technology industry in every part of the national territory. Third thesis is theirs the key mission is the application of models of endogenization results of technological progress in the institutional structure, as the basic condition for inclusion of Serbia in the development of new global production system. In the context of these hypotheses, analysis of the relationship between the management of spatial development and implementation of the model of endogenization of technological development in the institutional structure is based on their role in the revitalization of developmental functions of three basic production- organizational models of modern industry (industrial districts, clusters, poles of generic growth) in Serbia. Exposed material, in addition to an introduction and conclusion, is divided into three parts. The first part analyzes the methodology and results of current characteristics of the national production-organizational system. The focus is on determining key factors that block or open the space for reindustrialization in accordance with the European concept of endogenous, auto-propulsive and self-sustainable development based on scientific knowledge. In the second part, the emphasis is on exploring the link between scientifically valid defined objectives for reindustrialization and content of institutional reforms and policies for their implementation, primarily in terms of creating conditions for the spatial development of Serbia in the framework and elements defined in the ESDP document. The focus of the third part is the concretization of the determinants of the institutional framework for managing spatial development from national to local levels to the realization of the strategy of reindustrialization of Serbia.

NSW MSAC was established in 1998 in NSW Australia and aims to increase the emphasis on safety and health within the mining industry by reviewing and analyzing safety performance, setting strategic directions, providing advice and developing policy recommendations. The project itself aimed to deliver a self-sustaining method for achieving and monitoring continuous improvement in OHS culture and practice to the NSW mining industry. The pilot sites involved in the project tested a set of self-assessment tools to enable mines to assess and improve their own OHS culture and performance on key elements of an OHS management system. The tools allowed examination of the current OHS culture of the sites. Sites then used a participative planning process to develop an improvement plan. This paper provides summary data only, without identifying the individual sites that were the source of the data.

Multiple regression analysis was used for testing the hypotheses of the study. The results indicated that four dimensions of organisational learning culture - continuous learning, inquiry and dialogue, connection to environment, and strategic leadership - significantly influence the project manager capabilities. However, team learning, embedded systems, and empowerment were not predictors of project manager capabilities. The study also showed that establishing embedded systems for capturing and sharing learning significantly enhances project members' capabilities. Based on the reached results implications for theory, practice and future research were suggested.

Upon arrival, these new companies encounter high environmental uncertainty. This turbulence can quickly lead to disintegration of these companies because of being barely effective in development and maintenance of competitive advantages needed for benefiting from these opportunities by the course of time. Besides establishment of company, the entrepreneurs can be hopeful to their long-term survival only if their resources are strategically utilized. Objective of strategic entrepreneurship attitude is to organize the resources so as to help identification and utilization of entrepreneurial opportunities contributing to development of competitive advantage. Among others, human resource is highly significant due to its scarcity, non-substitutability and non-limitability.

Interval Between Oestrous Characteristics and Pregnancy Rate in Synchronised Kedah-Kelantan and Crossbred Cows	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND VETERINARY ADVANCES			English	Article						Beef cattle; synchronisation; oestrus; ovulation; artificial insemination; pregnancy diagnosis and crossbred cows	GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING-HORMONE; TIMED ARTIFICIAL-INSEMINATION; BOS-INDICUS; BEEF-CATTLE; DAIRY-COWS; OVULATION; ESTRUS; OVARIAN; PROGESTERONE; CYCLE	The study was conducted to determine the differences in the interval between removal of Controlled Internal Drug Release (CIDR) and standing oestrus (C_ES) interval between CIDR removal and Ovulation (C_OV) interval between oestrus and Ovulation (ES_OV), predetermined Artificial Insemination (AI) and Pregnancy rate following prostaglandin (PGF) treatment and CIDR removal at standing oestrus in Kedah-Kelantan (KK) and KK crossbred cows. A total of 35 KK (n = 11), Brakmas (BK: n = 10) and Charoke (CK: n = 14) cows were inserted with CIDR containing 1.38 g Progesterone (P4) for 7 days and followed with intramuscular injection of 500 mu g Cloprosterol of PGF synthetic analogue 2 days prior CIDR removal. The oestrous behaviour was observed for 72 h at 2 h intervals beginning 12 h after CIDR removal. AT was carried out at 6 and 12 h after standing oestrus was detected. Mean interval between C_ES, C_OV and ES_OV were 52.97 +/- 6.16, 94.42 +/- 16.41 and 53.75 +/- 25.36 h, respectively. The number of follicles >5 mm in diameter at the time of CIDR removal was significantly lower in CK (p = 0.04) compared to KK. The results of POF size and number of follicle size >= 5 mm either at CIDR removal or prior ovulation and P4 concentration at day 0, 7 and 14 were found to be not significantly different at p = 0.05. The pregnancy rate was higher (p<0.05) in CK (43.8%) followed by KK (31.3%) and BK (25%). The study provides results which could be used in the development of TAI on oestrous synchronisation protocol of KK and KK crossbred cows.

J	Balocco, R; Ghezzi, A; Rangone, A; Toletti, G				Balocco, Raffaello; Ghezzi, Antonio; Rangone, Andrea; Toletti, Giovanni			A strategic Analysis of the European Companies in the ICT Sales Channel	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						ICT; distribution channel; digital economy	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; SMES; INNOVATION; ADOPTION; BENEFITS	The strategic role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is growing in various companies. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) adopt ICT solutions to support their processes and to improve their products and services. Because of SMEs' scarce resources and inadequate ICT competencies, they need support from ICT suppliers in the ICT adoption process. Little attention has been paid to the business models and strategies of ICT suppliers in the academic and professional literature, and SMEs find it difficult to determine the characteristics of available ICT suppliers and to choose the supplier that best responds to their needs and aims. The goal of this paper is to provide a detailed picture of the ICT sales channel and its players in the European market. A classification framework is proposed and eleven different business models are identified. The paper is based on a case study methodology that included 53 semi-standardized interviews with CEOs (Chief Executive Officers) and marketing and communications managers at leading European ICT suppliers coupled with the literature review.

J	Bang, VV; Joshi, SL				Bang, Vasant; Joshi, Sharad			Market expansion strategy - reasons for and against: what do managers in India think?	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						market expansion strategy; emerging markets; replacement demand; opportunity analysis	ORIENTATION; BOTTOM; SHARE	Managers have been often criticized for not making adequate market expansion efforts especially in emerging markets. In strategy literature various reasons have been cited for and against choice of a market expansion strategy. However these are mostly opinions of scholars which have not been empirically examined. A lot of literature on marketing to emerging markets and bottom of the pyramid segments is normative in nature. In this study a maiden attempt has been made to examine views of managers from consumer products companies in India. Reasons for and against choice of a market expansion strategy are classified into three categories: market domain related reasons; industry domain related reasons; and team domain related reasons. Hypotheses with respect to each category of reasons have been tested through a cross-sectional survey of 28 senior level managers. Data have been collected through a combination of a structured questionnaire and in-depth interviews. The study reports a mismatch between scholarly writing and views of managers on quite a few issues related to market expansion strategy. Depth interviews throw light on the strategic thinking of managers operating in consumer product companies in India. This study also discusses several market expansion strategy related innovations practiced by companies.

It first looks at the formal aspects of the relationship, explaining how they should be encapsulated in a contract and suggesting how responsibilities should be allocated or shared. The importance of shared strategic planning is emphasised in particular. The chapter advocates an account management approach to publishing relationships, proposes a number of tools to support this approach, and discusses techniques for managing interpersonal communications.

J	Borgianni, S				Borgianni, Sabrina			IU.R Residential Urban Interfaces. Strategies and tools for a renewal project	TECHNE-JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY FOR ARCHITECTURE AND ENVIRONMENT			Italian	Article						Public-private residential space; Microurban renewal; Living quality; Participatory design; Space-behavioural analysis		In the contemporary city, quality of urban space is a key element in life quality and a driving force for the competitiveness. The increasing complexity of relationships and the evolving needs and use patterns reflect urban complexity in a corresponding physical space: the urban interface, an entity that mediates the sociospatial relationships between public and private sphere and that assumes strategic importance in redevelopment of suburbs. Research, carried out on a case 'study project', defines the criteria for a Residential Urban Interface approach as a tool for micro-urban redevelopment which merge into the proposed Project Plan, the metaproject field aimed at process design, space design and design of management and use scenario.

THE STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS OF BLACK EMPOWERMENT POLICY IN SOUTH AFRICA: A CASE STUDY OF BOUNDARY CHOICE AND CLIENT PREFERENCES IN A SMALL SERVICES FIRM	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES			English	Article						boundaries; vertical integration; black empowerment; demand-side	ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT; INDUSTRY; ARCHITECTURE; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS; BUY	This paper studies the relationship between a firm's boundary choices within its value chain and the BEE pressures it faces from its clients. The paper shows that BEE policy alters the value chain preferences of a firm's clients. These changes in client preferences motivate the firm to altering its boundaries. More important, boundary changes due to BEE are implemented in a way that ensures that the firm retains crucial architectural knowledge, which preserves its competitive advantage. Firms therefore do not respond passively to BEE-induced changes in client preferences, but aim to meet BEE aims within their broader strategic environment.

J	Cau-Bareille, D				Cau-Bareille, Dominique			"Obey", "disobey" or "tinker with" reforms to the system: a subject for French teacher trade unions to work on	WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT & REHABILITATION			English	Article						Teachers; reforms; suffering at work; disobedience; trade unionism		This paper presents our work to support and train members of the teaching sectors of two trade unions. The aim was to encourage participants to discuss practices, the difficulties in their day-to-day work and impediments to taking action, given the current reforms to primary education, and thereby assess the reforms' impact on the teachers' activity. It was also intended to help trade unions build up a collective dynamic around their work and re-positioning the work activity at the heart of their preoccupations. This project consisted of one/two day workshops held at local trade union branches. They were led by an ergonomist and a trade union representative. The discussions revealed that the prescriptions received from the management increasingly contradict the values of the profession. Therefore, in the name of professional ethics, different strategies of resistance have emerged, from minor modifications to the prescriptions received, to disobedience. However, adopting such strategies is itself a cause of suffering for teaching staff, and leads to some leaving the profession prematurely. We will discuss the difficulty trade unions have in dealing with the issue of work, their strategic positioning as regards developments within the profession, and the role an ergonomist can play in this process.

J	Chapman, Z; Getzen, T				Chapman, Zaneta; Getzen, Thomas			Hazardous immorality: strategic externalization of risk and credit pricing	JOURNAL OF RISK FINANCE			English	Article						Investments; Profits; Loss; Risk management; Betting; Credit; Risk concentration; Bet-doubling; Gambling		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the risks caused by "hazardously immoral" contracts which force external parties to bear significant losses without their consent. Design/methodology/approach - The expectation of substantial future losses raises the question of how investors can become profitable by entering into such risky contracts. The authors investigate the use of such contracts, which obscure the expected cost of failure by not only concentrating risks but ultimately not taking routine charges for predictable, albeit uncertain, future losses. In their investigation, the authors look at a risk concentration strategy and discuss expected profits ( losses) under conditions of limited and unlimited liability. Findings - It is found that companies are more likely to minimize losses and maximize profits if they can obtain credit at a low enough interest rate and externalize the majority of the risk. Risks are more likely to be externalized when government and/or international agencies bail out the offending organizations to limit total damages and stabilize the economy. Originality/value - The main contribution of the paper is to show that a risk concentration strategy can be used to make the overall probability of winning arbitrarily large, even when individual trials have less than a 50 percent chance of obtaining positive profits. The corollary lesson is that credit is valuable, and having substantial credit obtainable at low rates is so valuable that significant gains are probable despite negative expected profits.

The legal obligations related to the protection and conservation of green areas has widened also for legal entities, which prior to these changes were not a subject to the fundamental regulation and obligations, "expresis verbis", such as the obligation not to charge with construction, not to cut in an unauthorized way, or not to throw any waste on green territories. By including the nurseries and greenhouses in the category of green spaces, the lawmaker hopes to stop the real-estate hunt and housing facilities, for the benefits of a healthy green environment, and not of an environment "made of concrete".

J	Darvish, H				Darvish, Hamid			Assessing the diffusion of nanotechnology in Turkey: A social network analysis approach	COLLNET JOURNAL OF SCIENTOMETRICS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Social network analysis; diffusion; nanotechnology; CiteSpace		According to the United Nations, nanotechnology is one of the emerging research fields which will have a positive impact on both developing and developed countries. For example, nanotechnology is used for water purification in poor countries. On the other hand, it is used in developed countries (rich) to manufacture better computer devices. Nanotechnology is a part of the strategic plan for each developing country. For example, the 7th European Union Scientific Framework (EUSF) has invested tremendously in nanotechnology since 2000. The Turkish government also has adopted a new approach by becoming part of the EUSF and has invested heavily in research and development. Focusing on an invisible college in the scientific community in Turkey, this study aims to evaluate the diffusion of nanotechnology among scientists. Using social network analysis metrics, we identified and analyzed the role and status of scientists in the two most prominent universities (Hacettepe University & Bilkent University) regarding nano-related technologies diffusion in Turkey. We found that co-authorship across the two universities is minimal, even in subject area research in both universities. However, the number of nano-related articles have increased exponentially in past decade in Turkey. Furthermore, a co-word analysis revealed the scientific trends in both universities. Keywords description revealed that the scientific trends in Hacettepe University are mostly nano biomedical research oriented whereas in Bilkent University scientific trends are metallurgical oriented in nano-related technologies. Data were derived from Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (WoS) version 4 database and CiteSpace was used to map the co-author network structure.

J	De Toni, AF; Fornasier, A; Nonino, F				De Toni, Alberto F.; Fornasier, Andrea; Nonino, Fabio			Organizational Models for Non-Core Processes Management: A Classification Framework	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational Models; Non-Core Processes management; Outsourcing		This study investigates the impact of different organizational models for the management of non-core processes in the facility management (FM) industry and seeks to suggest which is the best in terms of strategic and operative advantages and disadvantages. A literature analysis of the empirical evidence as to business process outsourcing and, in particular, as to the practices of the FM business sector has been carried out. The analysis has allowed us to identify a total of 11 organizational models that are a consequence of five different strategic approaches. A comprehensive classification framework of the strategies and organizational models on the basis of two dimensions is proposed: the organizational role of a non-core processes manager (called a 'facility manager') and the typology of non-core process/service providers. The framework enables the identification and the explanation of the main advantages and disadvantages of each strategy and to highlight how a company should coherently choose an organizational model on the basis of (a) the specialization/complexity of the non-core processes, (b) the focus on core processes, (c) its inclination towards know-how outsourcing, and (d) the desired level of autonomy in the management of non-core processes.

J	Estelami, H; Raymundo, CFV				Estelami, Hooman; Raymundo, Carlo			A longitudinal and cross sectional study of the impact of usage-based attributes on used product price advertisements	JOURNAL OF PRODUCT AND BRAND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Pricing; Consumer perceptions; Used products; Consumers; Vendors; Buyer-seller relationships; Cross-cultural studies; Product attributes	INFORMATION; JUDGMENT; WEIGHTS; MODEL; PERCEPTIONS; BEHAVIOR; BELIEFS	Purpose - The growing volume of consumer transactions in used products markets has given rise to strategic decisions made by sellers in the amount of information disclosed on usage-based attributes -product attributes that quantify the degree by which a product has been used. This paper seeks to address this issue. Based on the phenomenon referred to as the dilution effect, it is proposed that sellers would have less desire to disclose usage-based attribute information in product advertisements for older products. The effects of usage-based attributes on asking prices of used products are also examined and profiled across time and contrasted across three countries: Britain, Canada, and the USA. Design/methodology/approach - Used product advertisements were obtained for 1995 (USA) and 2010 (USA, Canada, and Britain). The ratio of ad content dedicated to usage-based attributes was then computed and profiled across various conditions, and variations were tested using statistical methods. Findings - The results indicate that a dilution-based strategy, whereby usage-based product information is less likely to be disclosed for older products, was evident in 1995 as it was in 2010. Furthermore, cross-country variations were observed in the use of this strategy. Research limitations/implications - The research presented can be expanded to cover other product categories where used products are exchanged and usage-based attributes constitute a fundamental consumer consideration in such exchanges. The research can also be extended to cover a wider range of countries for analysis. Originality/value - This paper extends traditional pricing theory to consider the effects of usage-based attributes on used product prices and associated consumer communications. Given the growth in the volume of consumer transactions in used product markets, this line of inquiry is relevant not only from an academic perspective but can also inform public policy and potential regulatory measures.

Its influence on the financial performance of the firm is the subject of advanced researches. However, the study of its impact on the strategic decisions taken by financial direction is less covered. The objective of this article is to study the impact of the board of directors on the financial decisions taken by Tunisian enterprises. From the econometric tests applied to Tunisian data of panel in the period between 1999 and 2005, the present study shows that the board of directors of firms does not constitute an effective tool of control in order to orient financial decisions to the interest of shareholders. This corroborates the entrenchment theory hypothesis and rejects the arguments of the agency theory.

J	Farahmand, NFH				Farahmand, Nasser Fegh-hi			Organizational Business Interest as Organizational Request	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						organizational business interest; organizational business interest; organizational request		Making a difference in organization or creating the very best product or service on the market or simply doing something loves to do. Furthermore, it seems that the emphasis on organizational empowerment as structure, and systems has not yielded the desired results as some of the companies where these variables have been changed, after sometime, went back to experiencing declining performance. It is therefore obvious that more research needs to be done to identify characteristics that enhance organizational performance. Implementing good environmental and organizational practices is good organizational business it can give a competitive advantage. This article attempts to explain the organizational business interest by patterns of thinking. Organizations use organizational resources as the basic ingredient for all that is required for their operations. They are therefore eager to maintain and improve the quantity of expendable organizational resources by not only resources utilization, but by also identifying, nurturing and maintaining characteristics that promote organizational performance. The key to organization success is having a organizational business interest in place. Whether organization is about to launch a start-up or organization have been in organizational business for years, organizational business' direction is guided by your organizational business interest. In spite of this general awareness, such long-term organizational business, strategic-level interest of organizational business has been lacking in most organizations.

J	Ghezzi, A; Balocco, R; Mangiaracina, R				Ghezzi, Antonio; Balocco, Raffaello; Mangiaracina, Riccardo			Technology Provisioning in the Mobile Industry: a Strategic Clustering	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Mobile; Strategy; Strategic positioning; Technology provisioning; Business model	VALUE CHAINS; MARKET; MODEL	This article develops a strategic clustering for Mobile Middleware Technology Providers (MMTPs), shedding light on the business models and the strategic positioning currently adopted by this actor typology. The paper combines a literature review and a multiple case study approach - 24 in-depth cases based on 72 semi-structured interviews were performed - to deal with a significant and relatively new issue, i.e., the role of technology providers in the mobile value network. Through the creation of a system of strategic clustering matrices, four key business models currently adopted by MMTPs - "Pure Play", "Full Asset", "Third Parties Relationship-focused" and "Platform and Content Management" - are identified, and insightful conclusions on the impact of this actor's newly emerging influence on the market's competitive dynamics are drawn. The framework created supports a wide set of mobile communications stakeholders - both incumbent and new entrants - in their decision making and strategy analysis process.

The case can be used to demonstrate that the implications of comparative advertising can be analyzed from different perspectives - consumer behavior, legal framework and business and marketing strategy. Design/methodology/approach - This case was developed solely from secondary sources as a basis for class discussion. It is not intended to serve as an endorsement, source of primary data or an illustration of either effective or ineffective management. Findings - While comparative advertising appears to be a tactic by which a message about the brand is communicated to the target audience, it is embedded in business and marketing strategy. Originality/value - With competition intensifying across industries and product categories, comparative advertising will only increase and this case can provide useful insights into the emerging phenomenon.

The Strategic Review gathered information on staff perceptions, perceptions of external stakeholders, changing citywide and neighborhood demographics, policy mandates, and budget and workload issues. The need for the review was based upon multiple, substantial changes not addressed in the 2000 Strategic Plan, including the 2004 merger of the Department of Human Services and the Department of Aging and Adult Services, changes among the executive management team, transitions among key political entities, new policy mandates and changing budget allocations. This case study describes the Strategic Review process and content, summarizing key challenges and lessons related to addressing workload demands, fostering positive staff attitudes, balancing internal and external information needs, and integrating data use and planning processes across the agency.

LEGALIZATION (LAUNDERING) OF CRIMINAL INCOME AS A RESULT OF MODERN STRATEGIC CONCEPT OF PUBLIC MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT: PROBLEMS OF LEGAL IDENTIFICATION	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						legalization (laundering) of income; criminal proceeds		With the beginning of market reforms, the Russian society became aware of the danger of infusion of illegally obtained funds to the national economy. In order to combat and to identify criminal cash flows, there was introduced Art. 174 "Legalization (laundering) of money or other property acquired by other persons through criminal activity" and Art. 174.1 "Legalization (laundering) of money or other property acquired through commission of a crime" to the Russian Criminal Code. Currently, the most common form of legalization is defined as the concealment or disguise of the true nature and true origin of criminal proceeds. In fact, under legalization one understands any action designed to disguise criminal proceeds, deception of other persons regarding the origin of criminal capitals, the issuance of "dirty" revenues for "clean" ones. As a result of errors and miscalculations in the strategy of macroeconomic management of the modern country, a certain part of population cultivates the growing need for committing crimes with the ultimate goal of obtaining money or other property, the amount of which will be increased proportionately to the overall amount of money and property valuables in the country. The practice of criminal cases under Article 174.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation indicates that the courts lack a uniform approach to consideration of above-mentioned crimes and making decisions on them. As a result, different decisions are made in similar situations. The main reasons for exclusion of crimes under Article 174.1 of the Criminal Code from prosecution, as well as for acquittals on this category of cases, are the following: failure to establish a cause-and-effect connection between the crime and the subsequent fact of legalization of criminal proceeds during the trial; denial of the public prosecutor to maintain the indictment due to insignificance of the act committed or the absence of proof of guilt of the accused parties. In order to improve detection of these types of crimes and investigations of criminal cases under the specified category, the author formulates the proposals that a legislator needs to provide a clear definition of "validation of ownership", to define the criteria for financial transactions and other operations that will differentiate the signs of legalization from disposal of the stolen property.

J	Iqbal, MZ				Iqbal, Muhammad Zahid			EXPANDED DIMENSIONS OF THE PURPOSES AND USES OF PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL	ASIAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						performance appraisal; administrative; developmental; strategic; role definition	TRAINING NEEDS-ASSESSMENT; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; SATISFACTION; CHINESE; DETERMINANTS; EMPLOYEES; ATTITUDES; FEEDBACK	This paper attempts to develop an understanding of performance appraisal (PA) and to identify inconsistencies in its purposes and uses through an analysis of previous studies. The paper explores the purposes and uses of PA in the literature and devises a scheme for classifying the practice of PA into four categories -administrative, developmental, strategic, and role definition. This work was done to expand our understanding of performance appraisal and to highlight its uses in connection with other human resource management and development functions. The study finds that previous researchers devoted the most attention to PA conducted for administrative purposes, followed by PA for developmental purposes; the strategic category of PA was studied somewhat, whereas PA for purposes of role definition was almost ignored. The author offers a full-scale inventory of the purposes and uses of PA for researchers, performance raters and ratees. The study proposes that raters need to focus on the broader dimensions of PA, not simply its administrative functions.

Because of this vital situation, most of the organizations have reviewed their business priorities and strategic perspectives and emphasized on the consistency with changes of business environment and the rapid response to the market and client needs through the new methods of cooperation. In order to respond to these challenges of business, the organization have chosen a new approach entitled the agility. Agile manufacturing has been defined as the ability to survive and thrive in a highly competitive environment with continuous and unpredictable changes by a quick and an effective response to the changes and also creating the products and services based on the customer demand. In this article, first the historical trends and circumstances, which have led to the emergence of agile manufacturing, have been studied and then the qualifications and abilities needed for the agility and also the agility providers in the organizations have been described.

J	Jeeva, AS; Dickie, C				Jeeva, Ananda S.; Dickie, Carolyn			A taxonomic approach to supplier intelligence in manufacturing: managing components of strategic procurement planning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						supplier intelligence; SI; supply chain management		This paper is used to explore requirements for achieving sustainability and survival of manufacturing organisations by means of ensuring continuous supplies for production. Under the current environmental uncertainty due to the global financial crisis and consequent demise of many companies, the contention is that manufacturers require more information and data regarding their suppliers and use supplier intelligence (SI) to reduce supply risk. Current research literature indicates there is little information regarding supplier intelligence; in the context of the supplier's supplier, supplier's financial health in terms of capital investment, debt, share market performance, financial reporting, accounting practices, auditing, corporate governance and operating environment. Consequently, a conceptual framework is proposed for gathering supplier intelligence to improve supplier relations and their management. The impetus for a planned approach to increasing information about a trading partner has become more critical since the collapse of well-known and stable MNCs and the demise of tier 2 suppliers. Supplier intelligence enables the buyer to advance their operations and long term strategies to succeed with more certainty, less supply risk, increased competitive advantage and greater innovative capabilities. Finally, a taxonomy for collecting SI data and information is proposed.

This promotional mix consists of a blend of advertising, personal selling, sales promotion and public relations tools. An advertising decision is primarily influenced by the choice of media, media budget etc. especially if the advertising is required to be done in a segmented market. Therefore an optimal advertising media selection is a strategic factor for the advertising of products in different market segments as each segment is consumer specific covering homogenous group of potential consumers with similar needs and wants. In this paper media selection model is developed to facilitate the advertising media selection process for multiple products that need to accommodate different market segments. The problem is solved through goal programming technique. A real life example from Indian business industry has been taken to validate the results.	[Jha, P.

Therefore, this survey is done in order to study the correlation between managers' leadership style and productivity in science in the Islamic Azad University of Iran's 4th region from 2006 to 2010. The survey method is field study, and the population consists of 589 senior, middle, and executive managers of 6 universities. Using Cochrane's formula, 120 people have randomly been chosen to be stratified appropriately with the volume as simple. Information has been collected through two ways, 30-question questionnaires of Likert's leadership style test and gathering science productivity indicators from the universities being studied. For data analysis, methods of descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (Spearman rank correlation and Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA ranks) have been used. The validity and reliability of this survey have been estimated equal to 85% using Cronbach's Alpha. The results indicated that in every university being studied, managers had the tendency to apply the leadership style in an autocratic way, and there was a direct relationship between managers' autocratic leadership style and lower science productivity indicators (p<0.05), and an inverse relationship between the cooperative leadership style and these lowe indicators (p>0.05). Hence, it can generally be concluded that one of the major challenges facing universities being studied is applying inappropriate leadership style by the managers in order to enhance the productivity of science and technology.

J	Kirovska, Z				Kirovska, Zanina			EU Support for Rural Development in the Republic of Macedonia	JOURNAL OF SETTLEMENTS AND SPATIAL PLANNING			English	Article						EU support; rural development; Republic of Macedonia		According to the standard definition, more than 91% of the EU territory is represented by rural settlements and this area represents the home of more than 56% of the EU population. The special treatment of this area is due to the fact that rural development is a solid platform for economic diversification in rural communities, although the concern for the rural environment often triggers financial costs. The EU Lisbon strategy for growth and employment, like the Gothenburg one for sustainable development are relevant strategies for the development of villages and towns in rural areas. Nevertheless, rural development policy is connected to a number of other policies established at EU level. The medium-term period 2007-2013 is focused on three "thematic axes": improving the competitiveness of agriculture and forestry, improving the environment, improving the quality of life in rural areas and encouraging diversification of rural economy. In order to ensure a balanced approach of the policy, member-states and regions are bound to spread their rural development funding across all three of these thematic axes. Some of the funding must be supported by individual projects through the "Leader approach". The national strategic goal of the Republic of Macedonia is oriented towards agriculture and rural development, also, towards increasing the competitiveness of the rural sector, achieving food quality and safety, achieving sustainable resource management, improving living conditions in rural areas, reform of regulatory and institutional framework. In support of the strategy, the EU provides financial assistance for Macedonia, in order to enhance the rural development and to establish a new framework for programming and delivery of financial assistance to this candidate country for EU membership.

J	Koeberle, P				Koeberle, Pascal			Promoting discourse analysis as a linguistic perspective to further explore strategic management issues An illustrative case study	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic management; Communication management; Linguistics; Discourse analysis; Strategy-as-practice; Issues in strategic management		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to promote discourse analysis as a valuable theoretical perspective to further examine how communication and other discursive practices may impact strategy-related outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - The author uses a single case study of a French village in an illustrative way, to show how stakeholders (can) communicate to influence the strategic development of an organization. Findings - A set a propositions is identified as an understanding of why new discourses emerge and institutionalize in a given setting. Research limitations/implications - As the production of texts was used to observe practitioners' participation in the strategy process, silent forms of participation may have passed unnoticed. Practical implications - Practitioners who aim at influencing the strategy process may be interested in identifying the discursive context (producers of consumers of texts) and in improving their conversational skills. Originality/value - The paper suggests a three-step process to study the strategy process from a linguistic perspective: identify the producers of texts, examine how the texts are written/told, explain how a set of texts come to dominate a conversation.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CRISIS MANAGEMENT'S LOGISTICS SUPPORT IN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS	POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						crisis management; logistics		Crisis management is a very important part of public safety. Its history has been changing over the last ten years, starting from the political changes, through various changes of its structural services, to the challenges have been put by all atmospheric phenomena in recent years. These changes caused that all services, after the years of theoretical discusses over the strategic documents, must be proceeded to implement them in practice. Today, in general, we can say that having a wealth of practical experience, it is possible to undertake the evaluation of the effectiveness in this area of public policy. The purpose of this paper is an attempt to assess the logistics support as key element of crisis management systems. Based on the assessment, becomes possible run the actions in purpose to evaluate the system. Irrelevant is here to judge the services from the subjective and political point of view only, but first of all, consider the implementation of an effective assessment model, which allows to approach to this such very important problem in the most objective way.

TARGET INDICATOR AND VALUES OF RUSSIAN ANTI-CORRUPTION STRATEGY	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY			Russian	Article						corruption; National Anti-Corruption Strategy; Corruption Perception Index		There is a high social demand in modern Russia to develop and implement a strategic (long-term) state anti-corruption program. Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of April 13, 2010 N 9 460 "On the National Anti-Corruption Strategy and National Anti-Corruption Plan for 2010-2011" is an important step towards the development of this anti-corruption strategy. But the National Strategy does not include any criteria that would allow judging how well it is implemented. The authors prove that it is possible to use the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) as a target indicator of accomplishing the tasks stated in the National Anti-Corruption Strategy. Using comparative analysis they determine target CPI values for the medium- and long-term periods. Thus the study of the CPI database proves that the National Anti-Corruption Strategy should never declare the beginning of another campaign to "eradicate" corruption in Russia. Political will and a number of other (primarily cultural) preconditions would allow not "eradicate", but radically limit the scope of corruption. If the target countries are those whose social and economic development and cultural level is comparable to Russia (like Chile), then the "natural norm" of the Corruption Index in Russia would probably be about 7 points, and a long-time effort is necessary for reaching this target. If we choose a realistic target for the effective National Anti-Corruption Strategy then it is better to set a more modest target of raising the CPI to about 3,5 points by 2020 stressing the sustainable growth of this value.

J	Leonard, J				Leonard, Jenny			MODEL OF PROJECT AND ORGANISATIONAL DYNAMICS	AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								The strategic, transformational nature of many information systems projects is now widely understood. Large-scale implementations of systems are known to require significant management of organisational change in order to be successful. Moreover, projects are rarely executed in isolation most organisations have a large programme of projects being implemented at any one time. However, project and value management methodologies provide ad hoc definitions of the relationship between a project and its environment. This limits the ability of an organisation to manage the larger dynamics between projects and organisations, over time, and between projects. The contribution of this paper, therefore, is to use literature on organisational theory to provide a more systematic understanding of this area. The organisational facilitators required to obtain value from a project are categorised, and the processes required to develop those facilitators are defined. This formalisation facilitates generalisation between projects and highlights any time and path dependencies required in developing organisational facilitators. The model therefore has the potential to contribute to the development of IS project management theory within dynamic organisational contexts. Six cases illustrate how this model could be used.

J	Lin, CH; Lin, T				Lin, Chin-Huang; Lin, Tse			Service innovation and competitive advantage with the perspective of system dynamics - using China Mobile as an example	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICES TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service innovation; competitive advantage; system dynamics; resource-based view; China Mobile Communications Corporation; CMCC	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; CAPABILITIES; PERFORMANCE; BUSINESS	To explore the mutual strategic and conditional relationship between service innovation and competitive advantage, this paper used case studies and a literature research to explore how competitive advantage can be reached through service innovation. Making use of system dynamics, (suitable for the analysis of dynamic, complex non-linear relationships), the analysis of systematic behaviour and the causal feedback loop model, this paper summarised the key driving factors that shape competitive edge into three core competencies: the ability to respond to the environment, strategy adaptation, and learning and innovation capacities. In this study, the tactical actions of the China Mobile Communications Corporation (CMCC), whose service innovation surpasses that of its competitors, is used as an example. The path of its development services, strategic choices and innovation performance are used as a case study to verify this study's argument and to offer a reference to the speculation on academic research and verification.

J	Liu, SK; Pan, NH				Liu, Sung-Kuei; Pan, Nai-Hsin			Integrating the diamond theory and the 3C model: The construction companies in Taiwan	JOURNAL OF STATISTICS & MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Living environment; Diamond Theory; Market Segmentation; and Strategic module		Following the completion and operation of the High Speed Railroad, many the construction of major public infrastructures in Taiwan would accomplish consecutively. After that, these domestic public constructions will only require maintenance and other jobs, which do not involve a high degree of professional technology. Those construction companies which own advanced technologies, professional talents and state-of-art equipments will have to seek opportunities form overseas and encounter the fierce international competition. Domestically, the consumers' demands caused by the social and technological upgrade will also lead to the changes of the living environment. The construction industry will inevitably expect the next upcoming wave of changes. This study is to analyze, based on Michael Porter's "Diamond Theory", the strategic module for the market segmentation and positioning of the domestic construction companies. It is also hoped that the outcome of the study can help companies better understand their competitive advantages, and provide reference for construction operators to conduct company re-engineering.

J	Masood, SA; Jahanzaib, M; Akhtar, K; Shahbaz, M				Masood, Syed Athar; Jahanzaib, Mirza; Akhtar, Khalid; Shahbaz, Muhammad			Do actions speak louder than words? An empirical investigation in terms of organizational performance in manufacturing organizations	LIFE SCIENCE JOURNAL-ACTA ZHENGZHOU UNIVERSITY OVERSEAS EDITION			English	Article						Manufacturing Organizational Performance; Actions of leaders; Skilsl and experience of leaders; Balance Score Card		During the last years, organizational performance of manufacturing organizations is considered to be a key for a country's economy. As a result of high positive performance of manufacturing organization; the overall effects on the society have attributed the attention and the interest of organisational researchers. Armstrong and Baron (2003) highlighted the need of performance management as being strategic, integral (vertical, functional, human resource integration and integration of individual needs), focus on performance improvement as well as with the development. Gates and Otley (1999) further broaden the scope of performance measurement to include strategy development and the taking of action. In this study, researcher investigates the extent to which an organizational performance is affected by the actions of manufacturing leaders than by just implementing strong rules and regulations in the manufacturing organization. It was also examine whether differences in manufacturing organizational performance and actions of their leaders relate directly to manufacturing organizational performance or vice versa. There are number of tools and techniques available to measure organizational performance e.g. balance score card theory (BSC) by Kaplan and Norton (1992) based on stakeholder theory. The balanced scorecard approach was used as an operational tool, and it is employed to measure and improve operational performance of manufacturing organizations. According to Professor, Bob Kaplan, balance scorecard approach has further extended the measurement of organizational performance. Lipe and Salterio's (2000) observed that the application of balance scorecard approach facilitates managers' judgment, they further elaborate that balance scorecard approach improves managers' judgement regarding what is actually essential without any overloading of information. Further according to Tomasello M et al (2005), humans are more skilled than other animals at discerning what others are perceiving, intending, desiring, knowing, and believing-allowing group decision based on mutual discussion. It is therefore expected that the performance of the manufacturing organizations in this study to be attributed to the ability to actually do the job of their subordinates by the manufacturing leaders and thus set an example for the workers and thus enhance the performance of the manufacturing organization. Based on the results of data analysis of 132 manufacturing organization leaders/workers, it was found that organizational performance measured using balance score card approach is negatively related to both strong rules and regulations than by the actions of manufacturing organization leaders. Researcher argues this is due to strong rules and regulations in manufacturing organizations and so subordinates own innovativity reduces and causes organisational performance at stack. On the other hand manufacturing leaders' positive attitude has a significant positive relation between manufacturing organisational performance. Finally, it was also observed that manufacturing leaders educational background, related field experience positively influences the manufacturing organizational performance. Overall, results suggest that the more skilled and experience a manufacturing leader has, the more positive is the organizational performance. In a nut shell it can be concluded that manufacturing organizational performance is directly related to the actions of manufacturing leaders as well as the skills, experience and ability to do the job of his/her subordinate. A model for improving performance of manufacturing organizations has been developed as a result of data analysis of this study and is presented in this paper to enhance the performance of manufacturing organizations.

J	Miranda, F				Miranda, Francisco			Guidance Stabilization of Satellites Using the Geomagnetic Field	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING			English	Article							MAGNETIC ATTITUDE-CONTROL; SPACECRAFT SUBJECT; FEEDBACK-CONTROL; RIGID-BODY; SYSTEMS	In the last years the small satellites have played an important role in the technological development. The attractive short period of design and low cost of them and the capacity to solve problems that are usually considered as problems to big and expensive spacecrafts lead us to study the control problem of these satellites. Active three-axis magnetic attitude stabilization of a low Earth orbit satellite is considered in this work. The control is created by interaction between the magnetic moment generated by magnetorquers mounted on the satellite body and the geomagnetic field. This problem is quite complex and difficult to solve. To overcome this difficulty guidance control is considered, where we use epsilon-strategies introduced by Pontryagin in the frame of differential games theory.

J	Moharrami, M; Afshari, M				Moharrami, Mozhgan; Afshari, Mohammad			Review the existing lack of requirement for performance auditing and its impact on improvement in organizational knowledge	LIFE SCIENCE JOURNAL-ACTA ZHENGZHOU UNIVERSITY OVERSEAS EDITION			English	Article						Performance (Operational) Auditing; Public Sector Institutions; Accountability; Public Administration; Efficiency; Effectiveness; Cost-Effectiveness; Knowledge Management; Human Resources Audit		Today in economic environment that has several systems with different dimensions management of organization growingly focuses on evaluation of cost-effectiveness, efficiency and effectiveness of organizational operation; operational auditing is used as a tool for such assessment. It necessitates in competitive environments that managers to lead the affairs properly in the path of work progress and toward the strategic goals which considered consciously by the given organization by adopting of performance evaluation process. Performance auditing is a useful tool to adjust these systems and leading the organization toward its objectives. In our country, government is responsible for administration of the majority portion of economic sources and quality of managing them essentially influences in nation's fate. Performance auditing reflects a modern attitude toward auditing, which comprises of common auditing and management consultation. Performance auditing is focused on way of utilization from organization's sources and it deals with information and intra-organizational systems and instructions and mainly acts as an advisor for management. On the other hand, performance auditing may play crucial role in improvement of knowledge management by transferring the possibility for optimal decision making. Given that knowledge management denotes knowledge management for empowerment of personnel and organization to do their activities efficiently so in the present research, 5 dimensions of knowledge management (Knowledge acquisition, knowledge record, knowledge transfer, knowledge creation, and knowledge application) have been investigated. The given study is of descriptive survey type and it is considered as applied research in terms of objective where library and field study method has been adopted for review and gathering information. Furthermore, a questionnaire was prepare and distributed among respondents and the results were obtained after collection data and conducting the statistical computations via SPSS software. 12 hypotheses have been taken into consideration to examine the aforesaid subject and findings from hypotheses were separately mentioned. Statistical population of the present study has been divided into 4 groups as follows: 1-Auditors from Iranian Audit Organization, 2-Auditors of Supreme Audit Court, 3-Experts and professors, and 4-Managers and experts from Governmental Institutions (Public Sector). Finally, according to regulations of groups, the results of the investigation into the existing deficiencies in requirement of performance auditing are based on this fact that lack of intellectual and behavioral independence in performance auditors is considered as most trivial challenge while lack of an appropriate budgeting system as well as absence of adequate rules and regulations and commitment of governmental managers to traditional techniques are deemed as the paramount challenges. At last, some practical and relevant suggestions have been also presented to continue and follow up the similar researches in the future. And with respect to the results obtained from review of binding nature of any hypothesis in different dimensions of knowledge management suggests that performance auditing may play crucial role in optimization of organizational knowledge.

Natural gas demand and supply modeling with geo-spatial technologies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Pakistan; Natural gas; Supply and demand; Modelling; Geographic information system; Vector data; Overlay analysis; Geoprocessing		Purpose - Natural gas makes up about 50 per cent of Pakistan's energy consumption, which is decreasing at an alarming pace, making Karachi - the largest city of Pakistan - one of the major victims of natural gas shortfall. The purpose of this paper is to model natural gas demand and supply using geographic information systems. Design/methodology/approach - Sui Southern Gas Company datasets were used to derive annual per capita gas usages and to analyze the capacity of gas supplies. Union Council is taken as a smallest and basic analytical administrative spatial unit for appraisal of badly affected, with insufficient, low and better gas supply regions. Findings - Results show that the per capita demand for natural gas is higher in high class residential areas while supply is lowest for upper middle and lower middle class residential area populations. Only 19 per cent of the total residential areas are expected to be free from gas shortfalls. About 53 per cent of residential areas are facing the problem of low gas availability; and 3 per cent and 11 per cent areas are under stress of badly affected and insufficient gas supply, respectively. Originality/value - This research shows an example of constructing a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based gas demand and supply model that can be used for building strategic guidelines for top-level planners, engineers and decision makers at the micro-level. This is not a "deep" paper, but it works in identifying a problem and presenting a quantitative way forward. This paper will have significant impact both on society and academia, as this innovative technology and its implementation on gas utility has happened for the first time in Pakistan. Furthermore, in the international literature this has also been in infancy and will open new avenues of research, especially in developing countries. The work would certainly be applicable for other consumer-based utilities such as electricity, telecommunication, sewerage and municipal water and they would all benefit from it substantially.

J	Ojiako, U; Liu, Y; Johnson, J				Ojiako, Udechukwu; Liu, Yue; Johnson, Johnnie			Eastern promises: a philosophical exploration of decision making under 'unconventional' and asymmetric competition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						decision making; unconventional competition; asymmetry	WARFARE; LESSONS	Bingfa, most popularly recognised in Western literary circles as the art of war, was an ancient Chinese treatise on strategy probably produced around 515-512 BC. Representing perhaps one of the most concise and comprehensive works on Eastern military strategy and decision making it primarily advocates indirect engagement with competitors, particularly where absolute certainty of success is limited. In this paper, utilising a series of propositions, the authors conduct a philosophical exploration into how Sun Tzu's work may possibly inform thinking on strategic decision making (hereafter SDM). The authors discuss how a sizeable body of literature exists which outlines how Sun Tzu may be applied to strategic decision making in the West. The reality however is that a large majority of such works remains largely conceptual in nature. Following these traditions, in this study the authors seek to utilise theories associated with social interpretation (hermeneutics) to relate Sun Tzu's work to SDM.

J	Ozel, B; Park, HW				Ozel, Bulent; Park, Han Woo			Examining Korean political figures using co-word analysis in agreement with facial expressions in posted self-images	COLLNET JOURNAL OF SCIENTOMETRICS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Visual Content Analysis; Emotional Content Analysis; Online Visibility; Web-based Campaigns; Facial Expressions; Candidate Web-sites; Co-word Analysis		This study combines online image content analysis and text content analysis of the homepages of political figures, specifically South Korean National Assembly members. The study attempts to explore the relations between (1) the types of facial expressions present, using the official photographs on the members' homepages, (2) the textual contents of self-posted public profiles, again using members' homepages, (3) members' socio-political-demographic attributes, and (4) their web visibility and link counts on popular websites. In a previous study, we examined the emotional content contained in facial pictures of South Korean politicians. The results suggested significant patterns between facial expressions, web visibility and the socio-demographic attributes of politicians. In this paper, we further explore the textual contents of members' homepages using co-word analysis techniques to ascertain to what extent textual contents are in agreement with facial expressions in posted self-images. In addition, having employed co-word analysis we attempt to derive a strategic diagram of the 18th National Assembly based on clusters of key phrases and words posted on the members' homepages. This approach allows us to investigate central and peripheral clusters of keywords and their distribution considering members' socio-political-demographic attributes.

J	Pei, RM; Youtie, J; Porter, AL				Pei, Ruimin; Youtie, Jan; Porter, Alan L.			Nanobiomedical science in China: a research field on the rise	TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT			English	Article						nanotechnology; nanobiotechnology; bibliometric analysis; China	NANOTECHNOLOGY LITERATURE; NANOSCALE	Medical and health care applications of nanotechnology have increasingly attracted research and innovation attention. Nano-biomedical science (NBMS) is a term we use to define this emerging domain. As China is one of the leading countries in nanotechnology, but lacks a long history as a biosciences leader, this paper explores the competitive positioning of China in the development of NBMS. Specifically, this paper profiles the research patterns of ChineseNBMS in comparison with the four other largest countries in NBMS, using bibliometric techniques. The results indicate that China is a leader in NBMS, leveraging its strengths in chemistry and physics in the broader nanotechnology domain. However, China's relative weakness in traditional biomedical disciplines, and its lack of presence in highly influential global journals, could prove to be limiting factors.

This study compares leadership styles in Thai and Australian public sectors. The data were collected from staff in public sector settings in Australia and Thailand. The results confirm four leadership styles that suit the public sector culture in both countries: communication-oriented, strategic thinking and planning, relationship building, and conflict management. In the Thai public sector system, leadership that focuses on goal orientation is ranked most highly: Australian public sector organisations focus on leadership that fosters equity among organisational members, creates a supportive environment in the workplace, and facilitates participation. It is evident from this study that significant distinctions between the organisational cultures of Thailand and Australia are matched by marked dissimilarities of preferred leadership styles. Thus, an understanding of local organisational culture is important for effective leadership at all levels.

J	Prabowo, HY				Prabowo, Hendi Yogi			A better credit card fraud prevention strategy for Indonesia	JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL			English	Article						United States of America; United Kingdom; Australia; Indonesia; Credit cards; Fraud; Credit card fraud; Payments system; Crime displacement; Identity management		Purpose - The purpose of this paper, which is based on author's PhD study, is to assess the efficacy of Indonesia's credit card fraud prevention from a strategic point of view, using a model of payments fraud prevention practice developed by the author based on similar practices in the USA, the UK and Australia. Design/methodology/approach - Primary and secondary data, particularly from the payments system of the USA, the UK, Australia and Indonesia were used. Such data were collected by means of literature reviews and in-depth interviews with payments system professionals. Findings - The author establishes that credit card fraud prevention practice in Indonesia is still at a lower level of robustness than those in the USA, the UK and Australia. Deficiencies in the credit card fraud prevention practice in Indonesia are indicated, inter alia, by a lack of reliable fraud data collection, management and distribution mechanisms as well as a lack of effective and efficient identity management practice. Deficiencies and weaknesses in the system should be identified and action taken to make it more consistent with credit card fraud prevention practices of other countries. Originality/value - The paper sees credit card fraud prevention practice in Indonesia as a function of many factors which influence one another, based on which the analysis is built.

While planning is vital to facilitate strategic decision-making regarding the appropriate nature and scale of tourism-related developments within a destination, the legislative frameworks that provide for, control and regulate many aspects of tourism development have neither been identified nor collated in an integrated manner. This research used a case-study methodology to examine the range and scope of legislation impacting tourism development in Australia. The study identified 285 current Acts that were categorized into five broad themes. On the basis of these findings, a number of recommendations for identification, collaboration and education regarding the legislative environment have been postulated.

J	Silerova, L				Silerova, Lucie			Management Models of Symphonic Orchestras in the Czech Republic and their Development in the 21st century	ENCATC JOURNAL OF CULTURAL MANAGEMENT AND POLICY			English	Article						Symphonic orchestras; Symphonic music; Music making process; Inner organizational processes		The European trend is manifest in everyday situations of classical music. Orchestras face reduction of subsidies. They are forced to merge, change status, or both. Their numbers are heavily declining. These trends are observed all over Europe. The aim of the project was to get deeper insight into the situation in Bohemia, identification of weak-points and finding basic guidelines, according to theoretical and practical experiences of similar European/US institutions. Methods involved case-studies, controlled interviews, principles of qualitative research. Historical context and comparison were also important. Findings: There is high reluctance to change (relationship of musicians vs. administration, lack of "manager attitude", absence of strategic planning). There is a low level of networking and sharing of administrative experiences. Practical output of the research was implementation of innovative steps to increase financial self-sufficiency in selected orchestras. New organizational structures, systematic long-life education and training of staff were implemented, more students were involved in work-practices and cooperation with universities was strengthened.

J	Stern, EK; Saathoff, G				Stern, Eric K.; Saathoff, Gregory			Crisis Leadership and Military Community Resilience	JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						crisis; leadership; community resilience; shelter-in-place; evacuation; community shielding	CONSEQUENCES	This paper takes the current all hazards (with a special emphasis on the CBRNE) threat picture to military installations within and outside of the continental United States and their associated military communities, as well as evolving patterns of community vulnerability and changing preparedness concepts (community resilience, whole of community), as a point of departure for re-examining strategic leadership challenges (Boin et al, 2005) associated with crisis management and community-resilience development. The paper identifies two key modes of response to pervasive threat to military communities: evacuation and shelter in place. Both academic research and practical planning in both the civilian and military realms have tended to focus on evacuation to the relative neglect of shelter-in-place. The paper examines the pros and cons of each mode of response. While traditional shelter-in-place concepts have significant limitations, many of these are transcended by state of the art community-shielding strategies which provide a more robust and enhanced form of sheltering-in place. In fact, community shielding provides a potentially superior alternative in many contingencies in terms of force protection, mission assurance, and continuity of operations. The paper concludes with an agenda for improving the resilience (and crisis management) capacity of military communities.

The firm is delivering the value to the customers while concurrently improving the standard of living of the artisan by uplifting rural employment. It has received many awards for following the best corporate social responsibility practices. The firm benefits the workers by connecting them with global markets. The Jaipur Rugs case also explores how a high level of decentralisation at investment and production helps it in converting all of its costs into variable costs and dramatically decreasing its fixed costs. The present case is divided in three parts to analyse the influence of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices. The first part outlines the organisational structure; the second part explicates its working while the third concludes the case through strategic discussion on firm's practices.

J	Umar, A				Umar, Amjad			Computer Aided Planning for Wireless Systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS DATA COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Computer Aided Planner; eGoverment Services; Information and Communication Technology (ICT); Mobile Computing; Wireless Communications	INTEGRATION	Information and communication technology (ICT) managers in the modern enterprises face a bewildering array of decisions regarding planning of new systems, integration of new systems with existing ones, securing the ICT assets, and administrating the resulting complex ICT systems. The rapid introduction of wireless systems (mobile computing and wireless communications) in the business and government settings is further exasperating the situation, particularly in the developing countries. A Computer Aided Planner (Planner), part of the UN eNabler Toolset, has been developed to quickly and effectively produce detailed strategic plans for a wide range of egovernment services with particular attention to wireless systems. This paper presents a high level overview of this effort.

To reuse and manage this dismissed heritage, after decades of new areas invasion policies, new issues based on areas conversion and buildings recovery are today brought to attention; buildings considered by international critics as witnesses of vital processes in West society over the past two centuries. They are however more vulnerable, for the low value the current opinion still confers to them, while the research world has opened a significant and widespread dispute. Therefore some requests for the ''Cultural Heritage and Landscape Act'' revision have been - advanced which has trivialized the problem - in order to include the industrial heritage within the cultural heritage, while it is urgent the redefinition of an ad hoc project status.

Romer model (2001) holds that every country is inevitably affected by the "growth drag" due to the limitation of land resource. So it's of profound strategic significance to measure the "growth drag" according to the character of Chinese land resource. Modified two-level CES production function was employed, and this paper modified the hypothesis of the model. The result indicates that the limitation of Chinese land resource casts shadow over the economic development of China, and the growth rate is 0.4618% lower than that without the limitation of land resource. Through implementing the land resource protection policy along with the technology improvement and the substitute effect of other factors to the land resource, China will keep a steady and balanced economic growth.

Despite the wide variety of academic fields that contribute to commons research, there are few undergraduate university courses that center on this theme. This study describes how a study abroad program in Thailand uses guiding questions about institutional arrangements to teach North American undergraduate students about commons resource-dependent communities' control and access regarding coasts, forests, and rivers. Components that will enable students to transfer this learning to other, more familiar settings are built into the field-based courses. This paper outlines how students learn institution-focused questioning on history of local resource management groups, resource access and use, exclusionary mechanisms, strategic collaborations, and power relations in very unfamiliar contexts. Through the lens of political ecology, the paper describes how focusing on institutions has shaped students' understanding of the commons, and how they have been able to transfer their newly acquired institutional perspective to a range of situations in their home contexts.

Strategic planning and strategic management help organizations to face rapid changes in today's flowing, complicated, and changing world. Strategic plan provides a model for identifying and solving critical problems that an organization faces. A strategic model identifies organizational strengths and weaknesses; takes advantage of opportunities and situations; and provides guidelines to overcome weaknesses and threats that may endanger an organization. Strategic planning is an effective initiative to meet the challenges of a competitive and changing world. [Ensieh Zahedi.

STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT RESEARCH IN EMERGING ECONOMIES: A LENS MODEL PERSPECTIVE	WEST MEETS EAST: TOWARD METHODOLOGICAL EXCHANGE	Research Methodology in Strategy and Management		English	Article; Book Chapter						Lens model; emerging economies; uncertainty; judgment; decision; risks	LINEAR JUDGMENT; SKILL; INFORMATION; COMPONENTS	Purpose - To provide strategic management scholars, particularly graduate students and new faculty members, a novel approach, the lens model, to investigate emerging economies phenomena. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a review of the strategic management literature and a search of the strategy databases and journals, I propose the lens model approach and discuss its origins, development, and designs since its introduction. It has been used extensively in such fields as cognitive psychology, social psychology, medicine, agriculture, human resources management, and organizational behavior. Besides the wide application, it has relevance for strategic management research. Findings - An illustrative study and a summary of the approach from a previous study in one prominent journal are also provided as guides. I conclude by providing recommendations on what to consider in using the approach for the study of emerging economies. Research limitations/implications - In addition to the strengths of the approach, its weaknesses are also discussed. Suggestions on maximizing the potential of the approach are also discussed. Practical implications - The approach is an invaluable source particularly for graduate students of strategy who often are unfamiliar with microlevel approaches. They can use it to supplement approaches for strategic management. Originality/value - To my knowledge, this chapter is the first to discuss the lens model approach in the strategic management literature. In that regard, it fills a gap in the research methodology literature. It can therefore help graduate students improve their careers.

Sources of Information and Awareness of Government Programmes on Climate Change among Rural Households in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION			English	Article						Climate change; Niger Delta; Awareness; Information sources; Legislative committees		Climate change is a clear threat to all sectors of the Nigerian socio - economic development including the natural ecosystems. This study ascertained the available sources of information and awareness of government programmes on climate change among rural households in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The region is Nigeria's largest wetland region and the third largest wetland in the world. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were used in an interactive manner to collect data from 400 rural households selected through multistage random sampling technique. The findings revealed that majority of the rural households received climate change information mostly through mediated and non-professional inter-personal sources. Also, majority of the rural households were aware of the ban on indiscriminate tree felling, bush burning and gas flaring as well as government's efforts in promoting afforestation. They however, perceived these programmes to be poorly implemented. Though the people of Niger Delta were aware of the existence of legislative committees on climate change in the National Assembly, they asserted that their impact were poorly felt in the region. The study therefore points to the need to strengthen communities' capacity to manage their resources, raise awareness of climate change problems among the populace and build the capacities of local institutions to support disaster management policies. There is also the need for government to partner with private telecommunication providers to send short messages services on climate change to their clients at regular intervals.	[Egbule, C.

J	Ismail, S; Kasim, N				Ismail, Suhaiza; Kasim, Nurkamariah			ACCOUNTING FOR NON-ACCOUNTING STUDENTS: WHAT AFFECTS THEIR PERFORMANCE?	JOURNAL OF TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING			English	Article						Gender; learning approach; non-accounting students; performance; prior academic performance; year of study		This study aims to examine the factors affecting the examination performance of non-accounting students in completing an accounting course, that is, Management Accounting. A questionnaire survey was administered to a total of 147 non-accounting students who enrolled in a Management Accounting course for a semester. The factors considered are gender, prior academic performance, year of study and learning approaches adopted which include deep, surface and strategic approaches. Using multiple regression analysis, the results reveal that prior academic performance and year of study have a positive significant impact on performance while the surface approach of learning has a negative significant impact on the performance of the students. This present study mainly focused on the overall performance of the students and did not investigate the effect of the factors on the performance of the various assessment components in Management accounting course. The findings imply that the Management Accounting course should be offered to higher level non-accounting students. In addition, for completing the course with good results, the surface approach to learning should be avoided. The present study is unique as it considers the students performance in a subject that is not the main discipline of the students (i.e., accounting course for non-accounting students).

J	Kok Fay, C				Kok Fay, Chin			WHITHER FINANCIAL REGIONALISM AMONG ASEAN+3	JEBAT-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY POLITICS AND STRATEGIC STUDIES			English	Article						ASEAN+3; Financial regionalism; financial crisis; international financial architecture; financial governance		Having experienced a major crisis in 1997-98, several regional cooperative arrangements in finance were designed by ASEAN+3 to mobilize collective responses to cope with major financial crises. While the current global financial crisis poses a serious challenge to the adequacy of existing regional mechanisms and institutions for crisis prevention and management, it provides a good opportunity for ASEAN+3 countries to press for more legitimacy of the global financial arrangements. In the absence of an effective global solution, the West now place their hope in the key member states of the ASEAN+3 collective action to mitigate the severity of the impending global recession. Can ASEAN+3 rise to the expectation? In view of the magnitude of the crisis as well as weaknesses of the existing regional financial cooperation, it remains to be seen what impact the current global financial turmoil would have on financial regionalism between ASEAN and the 'plus three' countries - China, Japan and South Korea. Whether an effective global solution is emerging is the central issue and one which will determine the future direction of East Asian financial regionalism. This further raises the question of whether financial regionalism is still relevant. An attempt is made in this article to address these issues.

FINANCING REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT USING BONDS IN ASIA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Real estate developers; Capital structure; Bonds; Loans; Convertibles	INVESTMENT	During the global financial tsunami, banks were very cautious in financing business needs due to tight credit conditions. Alternative ways for financing projects were sought after by real estate developers worldwide. Within Asia, notably in Hong Kong SAR and Singapore, a number of reputable property developers have been tapping the capital debt market for funds in recent years amidst an increasingly regulated loan market and competitive pricing. In the face of a growing bond market, some corporate bond issues arranged by these property developers have been successful. Apart from investment appetite, property developers have to gauge carefully the pros and cons of raising funds through bond issues. Successful bond issues need to be structured with suitable credit enhancement features since the perception of risk and rising interest rates are major deterrents to potential investors who would otherwise face bond defaults or bear high opportunity costs with the committed funds. Through a number of case studies, the suitability of bond financing for property development is compared with loan financing. It is found that a close monitoring of market conditions and some foresight are essential ingredients for successful bond financing, for both straight bond issues and convertibles.	[Lam, Patrick T.

A Computer-Aided Process Simulation Model to Navigate Value Chain Reconfiguration Using a Three-Layered Methodology	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Balanced scorecard; analytic hierarchy process; architecture of integrated information system; event-driven process chains; systems thinking; value chain; critical success factor; key performance indicators	BUSINESS; AHP; FRAMEWORK; TOOL	This paper develops a computer-aided process simulation model (CPSM) to navigate value chain reconfiguration. The model uses a three-layered methodology incorporating the principle of knowledge-integrated traceability (KIT) to create more efficient performance measures and provides a rigorous and stepwise clustered module structure that will act as a guideline for all entities decision makers are involved. The model is based on three kinds of mature toolsets variable. First, an in-depth interview of a group of experts makes the BSC (Balanced Scorecard) KIT model along with AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) technique into an integrated AHP-BSC structure. Second, internal validation of core propositions during CPSM development is then used to construct an account both qualitative and quantitative decision factors in the best delivery causality diagram of theory-building mode. Defining the KIT of toolset variables into two specific themes allows a practical hierarchy for AHP-BSC structure to be evaluated without excessive computation barriers, and the systems thinking archetype of strategic activities in the ARIS-EPCs (Architecture of Integrated Information System/extending Event-driven Process Chains) architecture delivers the validity and reliability of research methodology as validation model of CPSM development. Third, the hybrid ST-ARIS (System Thinking) simulation model is constructed based on the feasibility test of relevant decision factors whether or not KPI (Key Performance Indicator) could be measured. The reconfiguration provides new insights for contributing to the foundations to link the process capability of the value chain with the three-layered methodology, and emphasises the CPSM development by highlighting a specific approach associated with KIT.

J	Darlington, CC; Urban, B				Darlington, Christopher Charles; Urban, Boris			ADOPTION OF AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS BY GROCERY RETAILERS IN THE JOHANNESBURG AREA	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Retailers not only need the right data capture technology to meet the requirements of their applications, they must also decide on what the optimum technology is from the different symbologies that have been developed over the years. Automatic identification systems (AIS) are a priority to decision makers as they attempt to obtain the best blend of equipment to ensure greater loss prevention and higher reliability in data capture. However there is a risk of having too simplistic a view of adopting AIS, since no one solution is applicable across an industry or business model. This problem is addressed through an exploratory, descriptive study, where the nature and value of AIS adoption by grocery retailers in the Johannesburg area is interrogated. Mixed empirical results indicate that, as retailers adopt AIS in order to improve their supply chain management systems, different types of applications are associated with various constraints and opportunities. Overall this study is in line with previous research that supports the notion that supply chain decisions are of a strategic nature even though efficient management of information is a day-to-day business operational decision.

J	Donmez, D; Altuntas, G; Birgoren, T				Donmez, Dilek; Altuntas, Gultekin; Birgoren, Tarik			The relationship between entrepeneurial management and financial performance: Evidence from the hotel industry in Canakkale Region	ISTANBUL UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF THE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS			Turkish	Article						Entrepreneurial management; administrative management; strategic orientation; resource orientation; management structure; reward system; growth orientation; entrepreneurial culture; performance; hotel industry		It is aimed in this study to present the relationship between the entrepreneurial management (i.e. the management philosophy of an organization's overall internal management systems and organizational processes encouraging strategic agility, flexibility, creativity and continuous innovation, which lets the organization follow a selected marketing strategy and play the 'game' better than its competitors/dictates its 'game') and financial performance. With a literature review, an empirical study has been conducted on hotel businesses in Canakkale Region in Turkey with Pearson and Spearman Correlations as well as multiple linear regressions to present the relationships between entrepreneurial management, which aims to stimulate all individuals, regardless of their hierarchial levels, in an organization to think and act like entrepreneurs to achieve above-average returns in the long run, and financial performance. The study reveals that there is a positive relationship between strategic orientation with satisfaction of overall financial performance, ROE and change in assets; resource orientation with satisfaction of overall financial performance and ROE; reward system with satisfaction of overall financial performance, ROI, change in sales, net profit margin, net profit level, net profit from operations and ability to fund growth as well as entrepreneurial culture with ROI and change in sales. Furthermore, the findings suggest that growth orientation is the most important variable to contribute the financial performance.

J	Jost, PJ				Jost, Peter-J.			Joint ventures in patent contests with spillovers and the role of strategic budgeting	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS			English	Article						Contest; Spillover; Research joint venture; Organizational design; Strategic budgeting		We consider an R&D contest between n firms in the presence of external spillovers. Our analysis focuses on the effects of these spillovers on joint venture activities between firms. In particular, we are interested in how different budget responsibilities within the research joint venture (RJV) affect profits of firms taking part in the joint venture and profits of their non-cooperating rival firms. Three arrangements for RJVs are analyzed: First, cooperation, in which the firms participating in the joint venture completely share the research they create in the innovation process and each firm has a sovereign budget responsibility. Second, a collusive arrangement in which the participating firms not only share their research but have joint budget responsibilities in the sense that they make all strategic choices cooperatively and maximize joint profits. Third, a hierarchical form, in which the cooperating firms establish joint headquarters which have strategic budget responsibility in the sense that it can strategically subsidize R&D efforts of its member firms so as to maximize overall RJV profits. We show that the first two arrangements can be mimiced in the hierarchical structure and that a hierarchical structure is optimal if it completely subsidizes its members' R&D activities. In this case all rival firms are driven out of the contest. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Mbara, T; Van den Berg, H				Mbara, Tatenda; Van den Berg, Hugo			AN ANALYSIS OF PERCEPTIONS AND AWARENESS OF RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY PIPELINES IN SOUTH AFRICA	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Worldwide, there has been a rapid growth in the use of pipelines to transport energy products. Due to the strategic nature of energy products that are transported by pipelines, the importance of risk awareness, assessment and management cannot be overemphasised. With the risk of pipeline disruptions increasing globally, energy pipeline organisations are compelled to incorporate measures that should help to identify and address areas that can lead to energy pipeline disruptions. The incorporation of such measures for any organisation is premised on an understanding and appreciation of the risks involved. Given the strategic importance of energy pipelines, the main purpose of this paper is to establish whether the South African energy pipeline sector and the public at large appreciate the risks associated with energy pipelines. Thus, the paper seeks to ascertain awareness of the risks associated with the energy pipeline's physical environment, not only from the energy pipeline operators, but also from communities who are exposed to such risks. Data for the study was collected from energy pipeline operators and from a selected residential area in Johannesburg using both structured and unstructured questionnaires. The findings show that the corporate energy sector in South Africa is aware of risks associated with energy pipeline supply chains while the general public's awareness is very low.

J	Oleg, ND; Daria, VN				Oleg, Dunaev N.; Daria, Nesterova V.			ON ORGANIZATION INNOVATIVE MANAGEMENT CONCEPT	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						innovative management; concept of innovative management; microeconomic factors for innovative management		Analysis of the evolution of theoretical approaches on the nature and content of organization management has showmen an important role of the classic, evolutionary, behavioural, institutional and strategic theories for the concept of innovation management development. A special place within these theoretical views belongs to the entrepreneurial approach (by P. Drucker), which is combining innovation and entrepreneurship in one "technology management" - entrepreneurial management. The conclusion has been made that up to now the concept of innovative management is under development. It has not yet become part of strategic management. The approach to innovative management existing in the Russian modern economic literature considers it only as a single (specific) function-as management of innovations. Accordingly, the implementation of this function directed to development and implementation of a type of innovation-product, technological, organizational, and marketing and others. Such a narrow view on management of innovations (as a single function) makes the content of innovative management scanty like entrepreneurial management. At the same time this narrow view does not correlate to the new format of the innovation process where researches are only a part of the whole project and the main focus is displaced to demand forming, chain supply construction, clients' network creation. The conclusion has been made that there is a need for a broader view on the innovative management of organization like entrepreneurial management, for which a set of microeconomic factors: strategy and strategic control, organizational capital, financial resources, is necessary. Organization's strategy has two principal functions: to overcome the technological and market uncertainty. To perform these functions strategic control over resources by top managers and a system of incentives for innovative investment are required. Organizational capital for innovation exists in the form of functional and hierarchical integration of personnel; the system of incentives and remuneration methods generate collective learning. Strategy and strategic control, organizational capital and financial resources are closely linked in a dynamic process that is resulted in an innovation. This link is provided and supported by innovative management. The paper argues a broader view on the innovative management of organization as an interactive activity based on the feedback interactions (signalling management) and aimed at creating new competitive advantages within a firm/organization due to microeconomic factors. Combining and matching of these factors provide for an organization its competitive advantages due to competition in innovations. As a result, the organization is able to get Schumpeter's rent. Based on this approach some principles for innovative management concept development are declared in the paper.

J	Schoenberger-Orgad, M; Toledano, M				Schoenberger-Orgad, Michele; Toledano, Margalit			Strategic framing: indigenous culture, identity, and politics	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS			English	Article								This article analyses the role played by culture and the strategic communication of culture in the formation and establishment of the Maori Party. As an indigenous grassroots party, which achieved electoral success in the 2005, general election in New Zealand, the Maori Party offers an unusual case of cultural primacy as a political party for indigenous people. The Maori Party campaigned to be the first successful party to give a distinctive voice to Maori in a parliament dominated by Pakeha (New Zealand Europeans). In examining the Maori Party's formation and campaign as a case study, the article focuses on socio-political conditions, issues of national identity, media changes, and the cultural relations between Maori and Pakeha. It pays particular attention to those that influenced public opinion during the 14 months of election campaigning. It argues that the strategic framing of the Maori Party as a movement giving a distinctive voice for Maori established the foundations for the campaign's success. In conclusion, the significance of the achievements of the Maori Party in the 2008 general election are discussed as evidence of the now distinct and recognized representation of Maori within the New Zealand democratic process.

J	Krishnakumar, S; Rao, KSP				Krishnakumar, S.; Rao, K. Surya Prakasa			Learning and development premise in entrepreneurial orientation for employees in an Indian context	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Entrepreneur; entrepreneurship; entrepreneurial orientation (EO); intrapreneurship; entrepreneurial orientation for employees (EOE); learning and development (L and D); entrepreneurial orientation for employees (EOE) and training; organizational development	CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; FIRM PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; STRATEGY; LINKING; MODEL	World over post recession organisations are continuing to explore and focus on newer methods and approaches to harness the potential of employees within the organisation and ultimately towards organisational growth per se by the dictum of intrapreneurship. Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) has emerged as an important facet towards strategic management and of entrepreneurship literature for the past two decades. In the Indian context, the recession was well withered and progress and growth in organisations were imminent in various sectors. This paper explores the premise of Learning and Development (L and D) in Entrepreneurial Orientation for Employees (EOE) as a unique and novel approach in employee development. The results are drawn based on the pre-test scores in an Indian firm in the services sector and prior to administering EOE Training. The proposed study examines the significance of Learning and Development in EOE. The EOE approach will definitely foray ample scope for future researchers in this new and fast emerging field of entrepreneurship research. By experimenting and comparing through EOE training, the growth trajectory in employees by this novel approach of EOE will definitely augment growth perspectives in organisation.

J	Nejadirani, F; Rajabzadeh, A				Nejadirani, Farhad; Rajabzadeh, Armin			Survey of the relation between organizational structure and informational overload in commercial units: A case study of Iran tractor manufacturing company	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational structure; centralization; formalization; complexity; informational overload		Increasing mass information is one of uppermost puzzles for managers who forced to confront with them. On one hand there is also deficient correct information. They may find it difficult to determine which information constitutes corporations' strategic sources and lead to assets. But that is the question, what a proper solution is. Partly related to design and performance of management information systems. Another part of the solution can be found in design and establishment of appropriate organizational structure and management of organizational information sources. This research surveys the link between organizational structure informational overload in commercial Strategic Business Unit (SBU) of tractor manufacturing of Iran. Robbins theory was the basis in assessment of organizational structure made. Three dimensions to organizational structure: centralization, formalization, complexity, with some indicators for each one, has been evaluated by the theory. This research which by purpose, method, nature of the subject and specified directions is applied, is kind of correlational research (concordance or relational). Moreover data collecting has been done through survey and questionnaires that are in common use for evaluation. Population universe was 74 in people included all of managers and experts of the SBU. Reliability of the questionnaires applying Retest technique, the indicator of reliability coefficient which is kind of co relational coefficient, distinguished by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). This research has one major and three minor hypothesis. Final analysis of data verified the result: the first hypo (centralization) with 0.95 confidence level and the second hypo (formalization) with 0.99 confidence levels. But the third hypo (complexity) rejected. The major hypo (organizational structure) has been verified with 0.99. It is mentioned that the most impact on changes of informational overload variable caused by changes of formalization variable.

J	Kayikci, Y				Kayikci, Yasanur			Value Creation in Electronic Supply Chains by Adoption of a Vendor Managed Inventory System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Electronic Supply Chains; Partial Least Squares; Supply Chain Management; Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI); VMI System	VMI; DETERMINANTS; INTEGRATION; VARIABLES; PLS	Many strategies have been developed to manage supply chain operations effectively. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) system is one of the prevalent strategic tools of the supply side logistics based on the electronic data exchange and business process automation among the suppliers and customers to enhance the competitive advantage. VMI is widely used in different industries including automotive sector. The VMI concept is a continuous replenishment program where suppliers are given access to demand and inventory level of customers and they are fully responsible for managing and replenishing the customer's stock. VMI's extension on customer satisfaction cannot be perceived sufficiently by decision-makers who are responsible to develop and invest in the customer-supplier relationship. This paper presents a path model using the method of Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression to give insight to decision-makers to understand effect of the VMI adoption on customer satisfaction. This paper investigates both determinants of relative factors of successful VMI adoption and the relationship in the supply chain with an empirical automotive industry case. The results show that the collaboration and coordination between customer and supplier and infrastructure of the information-sharing are the important dimensions to add value to the supply chain and to enhance customer satisfaction.

J	Shirahama, K; Uehara, K				Shirahama, Kimiaki; Uehara, Kuniaki			Constructing and Utilizing Video Ontology for Accurate and Fast Retrieval	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIMEDIA DATA ENGINEERING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Concept Detection; Dempster-Shafer Theory; Query-By-Example (QBE); Video Ontology; Video Retrieval		This paper examines video retrieval based on Query-By-Example (QBE) approach, where shots relevant to a query are retrieved from large-scale video data based on their similarity to example shots. This involves two crucial problems: The first is that similarity in features does not necessarily imply similarity in semantic content. The second problem is an expensive computational cost to compute the similarity of a huge number of shots to example shots. The authors have developed a method that can filter a large number of shots irrelevant to a query, based on a video ontology that is knowledge base about concepts displayed in a shot. The method utilizes various concept relationships (e.g., generalization/specialization, sibling, part-of, and co-occurrence) defined in the video ontology. In addition, although the video ontology assumes that shots are accurately annotated with concepts, accurate annotation is difficult due to the diversity of forms and appearances of the concepts. Dempster-Shafer theory is used to account the uncertainty in determining the relevance of a shot based on inaccurate annotation of this shot. Experimental results on TRECVID 2009 video data validate the effectiveness of the method.

It not only adversely alters the landscape but it also seriously hampers the traditional living conditions of numerous inhabitants, who may be displaced against their wishes without receiving necessary compensation. In this paper, goal programming is combined with the analytic hierarchy process to determine optimal decisions for the planned relocation of people where surface mining may take place in a densely populated environment, while addressing multiple conflicting objectives. The combined approach is illustrated with a numerical example highlighting its usage in other decision problems.

J	Gunhan, S				Guenhan, Suat			Analyzing business management and technology characteristics of small and medium sized architectural design firms in Turkey	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Architectural firms; small and medium sized (SMEs); Turkey; business management; globalization	SYSTEMS	Globalization affects the way business is conducted. The worldwide openness of the markets creates both opportunities and threats for local companies. To survive and prosper in the new economic system, companies will need to develop new strategies. Therefore, analyzing the business and technology characteristics of small to medium size firms is critical in order to develop strategies to facilitate their integration to globalization. The paper presents the technology and business characteristics of small and medium sized (SMEs) architectural design firms in Turkey. The findings related to firms' strengths include that SMEs can adopt new technologies as long as commercial benefits are evident, that they are well aware of the importance of business development skills, and that they have an extensive partnership experience as well as some strategic planning culture. The findings related to firms' weaknesses indicate that SMEs lack the necessary skills to manage organizational growth, do not use project management software extensively, are not actively involved in new and effective project management technologies, and display low levels of specialization.

As a theory, markets polarity proves that market develop in a unitary way irrespective of their analysis and approach level, whether it is the extent level (their capacity), the level of structure, functionality or the level of markets evolution and dynamics. In other words, any alteration of the characteristic parameters of the market at a certain level results in a correspondent adjustment of the characteristic parameters of the market specific to its other levels of expression. Any structure alteration requires an adjustment of their functionality and any pronounced evolution or dynamics results in a volume adjustment of that market. The growth of development rate of the specific operations of a business fields results in productivity is an indicator which in turn is the base for the growth of production factors output rate and for general economic growth (volume growth of the field).

The aim of this study is to identify the reliable time series forecasting model to forecast loss reserve estimates of Egyptian general insurance companies. Exponential smoothing model, Box-Jenkins analysis and time series regression model are applied on actual reported loss reserves data for general insurance sector for the period 1986 to 2006 and their accuracy are compared based on several error measures. The series from 1986 to 2001 are used for the estimations process and the remaining observations are used to evaluate the models as outside sample data. Exponential smoothing technique in all steps-ahead is identified as the best forecasting technique to Egyptian general insurance sector.

J	Talebi, K; Rabiei, M				Talebi, Kambeiz; Rabiei, Mahnaz			The process of formation of manufacturing in small and medium-sized enterprises in Iran	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Manufacturing strategy; strategy process; small and medium-sized enterprise (SME); Iran	STRATEGY; PERFORMANCE	This paper investigate the process of formation of manufacturing strategy in six Iran manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Realized manufacturing strategy can be considered to be the pattern formed in the stream of actions taken within a firm's manufacturing function. The research aims to locate the source of that stream by identifying the causal origins of strategic manufacturing actions using a strategy charting method. The findings indicate that, for these companies, realized manufacturing strategy is predominantly formed through a bottom-up emergent process, arising from the preferences of personnel within the manufacturing function. For most strategic manufacturing actions, there is no demonstrable link to business strategy. As such, these firms are not following best-practice manufacturing strategy literature, which advises that manufacturing strategy be derived from business strategy in a top-down deliberate process. This is the case despite differences in the size, products, customers, owner-ship structures and histories of the companies. The paper speculates that, in Iran SMEs, more widely, manufacturing strategy may similarly not arise from the pursuit of business objectives. This may be because the concept of manufacturing as a potential strategic weapon is absent in the SME community, or because the formalized top-down deliberate process of developing manufacturing strategy associated with this concept is inappropriate in the dynamic environments in which most SMEs operate.

Building international entrepreneurship through entrepreneurship capital perspective	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						International entrepreneurship; capital; entrepreneurial proclivity; human capital; social capital	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; FIRM; ENVIRONMENTS; DIFFUSION	Is entrepreneurship capital theory useful for international entrepreneurship research and practice? In this paper, we describe how international entrepreneurship research can benefit from including the concept of entrepreneurship capital at the individual level of analysis. We define entrepreneurship capital as a composite measure of entrepreneurial proclivity, human capital, and social capital of the entrepreneur. We present a conceptual framework that defines the relationship between entrepreneurship capital, the local and target business environment and international entrepreneurship. We argue for the moderating effect of the business environment between the relationship of entrepreneurship capital and international entrepreneurship. Moreover, we argue that entrepreneurship capital at the individual level will be an important predictor of survival rates of international entrepreneurship in benign and hostile targeting business environments when business firms explore the internationalization strategy. Finally, managerial implications and future research directions are discussed.

J	Lee, HH; Yang, TT; Li, CR				Lee, Hsu-Hua; Yang, Tsau-Tang; Li, Ci-Rong			How does boundary-spanning search matter in China's new technology venture? The role of external relationship and internal competence	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Boundary-spanning search strategy; new venture; managerial tie; firm competence	ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION; STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP; ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; MARKETING-STRATEGY; FIRM PERFORMANCE; CAPABILITIES; EXPLORATION; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE	Following the resource-advantage theory, this study advances the existing research of boundary-spanning search by examining which configuration of a new venture's boundary-spanning search can obtain successful venture performance and how a founding team's external relationship and the internal firm competences shape the relationship between the distant search and new venture performance. This paper is based on a questionnaire survey/analysis of a sample of 178 new ventures from China, and it offers insight to entrepreneurs with regard to the importance of building external managerial ties and developing idiosyncratic internal competences on boundary-spanning search. In addition, this study also reveals that the effectiveness of the supply-side, demand-side and spatial-side boundary-spanning search on venture performance depends on investing resource at a rational level.

J	Fatemi, M; Jafari, MM				Fatemi, Mahsa; Jafari, Mehdi Matthew			Application of strategic planning for extension and development of agricultural production cooperatives in Iran	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Production cooperative; strategic planning; cooperation; strategy; participation		There is no doubt that in today's world establishment of cooperatives is an effective way of attracting people's involvement at macro level. The agricultural sector is so extensive that achievement of national goals and high levels of development is practically unattainable without active participation by farmers. Provision of a combination of agricultural functional requirements by cooperatives would lead to enhancement of the standard of living of their members. Rural production cooperatives, also known as agricultural cooperatives, are defined as a modern construct with their own specific organization and management. Cooperatives incorporate their own ruling principles, structures, networks, rules, regulations, and bylaws. These features provide concrete benefits in the process of agricultural development. This paper aims to review the activities of rural agricultural production cooperatives in Iran and propose a strategic planning approach for development and institutionalization of their operations. This qualitative research was conducted in Iran using case study and purposeful sampling method. The proposed strategies for promotion of production cooperatives include: provision of support in terms of financial credits, organizational and management expertise, technical know-how and technology, equipment and training, empowerment of members aimed at transforming them into successful farm managers, promotion of team work among members, and extraction of appropriate information and practical advice from research data provided by contemporary investigations. In conclusion, it is proposed that establishment of cooperatives alongside other issues should be considered by policy makers and local leaders and representatives trusted by farmers be involved in their implementation.

J	Bella, F; Ferrara, FF; Perricone, RS; Poleggi, G; Antonini, MR; Baratono, P				Bella, Francesco; Ferrara, Floriana F.; Perricone, Roberto S.; Poleggi, Giovanni; Antonini, Maria Rita; Baratono, Pietro			The PON "Reti e mobilita" and the Objectives of Sustainability: the Role of the Environmental Monitoring Plan	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			Italian	Article								The National Operative Program (PON) "Reti e mobilita" has been approved by European Commission on the 7th of December 2007. The strategic approach of the PON, exclusively devoted to the so-called "convergence regions" of Italy (Campania, Calabria, Sicilia, Puglia), aims to: 1. improve the modal balance by an economic, social and environmental perspective; 2. develop the inter-modality in order to move towards the integration of convergence area into the network of the European transport system; 3. improve the mobility and the accessibility, also to reduce the traffic congestion; 4. increase the efficiency related to security standards, to management techniques and to the quality of transportation services in the sector of freight; 5. guarantee the reduction of environmental impacts through a global improvement of the efficiency of the transport systems. In such a way it is clear that the PON "Reti e mobilita" takes greatly into account the Sustainability principles recognized at European scale as attested by the budget, namely over the 70% of the entire fund, associated with low-impacts infrastructures (railways and harbors). The PON has been submitted to the SEA procedure, following what the 2001/42/CE Directive establishes. The Environmental Report of PON devotes great attention to the monitoring activity as shown by the reported recommendation about the need for adequate measures for the environmental monitoring, also in order to apply corrective measures during the implementation of the program. By this point of view, a first and important step has been the elaboration of the "Environmental Monitoring Plan" (EMP) that represents the main methodological document for the following implementation of the monitoring activity. This paper, after a brief presentation of the program and of the objectives of Sustainability that the Programs aims to pursue through the realization of specific projects, is devoted to introduce the Environmental Monitoring Plan of the PON that has been approved by the Ministry of the Infrastructures and Transport - in charge as Management Authority of the PON- in February 2011. In detail, the PMA represents the tool through which, the Management Authority, that has specific responsibilities and functions in terms of monitoring and environmental assessment of the program, controls the significant impacts on the environment caused by the implementation of the PON and verify the level of achievement of the established objectives of environmental sustainability. The structure of EMP is based on three main aspects: 1) the adoption of the results of other interesting experiences carried out by experts institutions on the topic; 2) an approach favoring the creation of an "integrated" monitoring system with the others Operative Programs activated at regional scale; 3) the implementation of a cooperation and shared process with all the directly-involved actors.

J	Lee, JM; Lee, KC; Chae, SW				Lee, Jong Man; Lee, Kun Chang; Chae, Seong Wook			Designing a COntext REcommendation System (CORES) for Context Prediction Based on the Dempster-Shafer Theory	INFORMATION-AN INTERNATIONAL INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL			English	Article						context-awareness; Dempster-Shafer theory; context prediction; mobility prediction	HISTORY	Context prediction and service recommendation is a method that can be used to support strategic decision making through the acquisition and utilization of information pertinent to the context of the environment, user, or mobile device. Those are essential for satisfying customers by providing high-quality intelligence services. This paper proposes a novel COntext REcommendation System (CORES), which is a decision making method for predicting a user's mobility by analyzing and synthesizing existing data, context information, and user preferences based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory.

J	Mazzeo, G				Mazzeo, Giuseppe			Meanings of a territorial infrastructure: the airports	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article								The paper want to explore the major meanings of an airport. It is a territorial infrastructure that increases the spatial accessibility and the economic potential of a territory; in this sense, it is also a port to boost tourism and cultural exchanges. It is also an infrastructure bringing with it investment in other areas of mobility. Since the sixties, finally, it has also become an architectural icon and a symbol of urban level. Objective limitations remain; in particular for the position, outside the city, and for the service, that can be ordered and tidy. The airports have an important role for the move of people. As the international transport statistics the number of passengers in the main airports is growing, also if has suffered the blows of the international economic crisis. The expansion of air passenger traffic is related with the tendency to the specialization of travels, according to the range of movement of persons. The actual changing economic world coincides with a process of continuous growth of passenger flows, partly independent from that of economic growth; the combination of these two processes has multiplied the number of connections and has produced new phenomena. The transport system isn't a neutral system, also if it is sectorial; it, rather, is linked very strongly with the territorial system in which it operates and with the location's choices of firms and individuals. This reflection has value for all the transport's infrastructures, although with different degrees. In this ranking the airports are located in a great importance position, as they can be a strategic asset in the territorial economic growth processes, contributing directly or indirectly to the development of local enterprises. An airport operates whether as a supplier of infrastructure or as a business reality in itself, operating in a highly competitive market with an high speed of change. Airports are an architectural and urban typology typically lacking of physical and spatial integration with their urban context; for this the airports have evolved into semi-autonomous spaces. For their dimensional characteristics and for the incidence of pollutants factors, must be placed outside the city, often at significant distances from the same: their fundamental role in the urban structure is expressed, therefore, in external spaces from the city. As defined above, the airport is an urban infrastructure. But it is other things also: it is an ordered place, because its management requires defined actions and sequences of activities that are the true opposite of the urban disorder. Both the structures are complexes but the airport is a side where the hierarchical roles are well defined, more than in other sides, and it is the side where the authority is recognized and well accepted. The building of new airports, or the modernization of existing structures are a sign of the sectors' vitality and of the necessity to offer better services to an expanding custom. But the airports have created a lot of imagines around their presence and use.

J	Hajipour, B; Talari, M; Shahin, A				Hajipour, Bahman; Talari, Mohammad; Shahin, Arash			An investigation of the relationships between industry structure, strategy type, organizational characteristics and organizational performance: A case study of the food and chemical industries of Iran	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Industrial structure; strategic type; market orientation; organizational learning; innovative culture; organizational performance	DISTINCTIVE MARKETING COMPETENCES; LEARNING ORIENTATION; FIRM PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; FRAMEWORK; MATTER; ADAPTABILITY; CAPABILITIES; ANTECEDENTS; MANAGEMENT	Studying the influence of main factors on organizational performance is an important subject in the strategic management literature. Generally, performance differentiations' resources among organizations are definable in terms of the existing industrial structure in industrial organization literature (OI) or characteristics of the organization in resource-based view (RBV). In this article, a model has been developed based on these two fundamental views after studying related literature. The proposed model has been examined in 48 chemical and 76 food industries by means of structural equations' model and based on partial least squares (PLS) methodology. Results imply that industrial structure determines organizational characteristics, which in turn leads to superior organizational performance. Non-homogeneity of organizational characteristics could be explained not only through competition intensity but also by the means of applied strategic type in an organization that shows goodness and consistency of organizational-strategy characteristics. The obtained experimental results support almost all of the hypotheses except the hypothesis related to the influence of industrial structure on strategic type.

J	Kim, E; Kim, HK				Kim, Eunjin; Kim, Huy Kang			Strategic Customer Relationship Management of Firms under Competition	INFORMATION-AN INTERNATIONAL INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL			English	Article						Customer relationship management; Customer loyalty; Customer value; Firm competition		Customer loyalty has been proven to be the most important factor for profit generation of firms. Hence, many firms try to invest in customer relationship development to increase customer loyalty. However, due to firms' limited resources for investing in customer relationships, and due to the fact that not every customer relationship can be equally profitable, firms need to find customers with whom the firm can build more profitable relationships. Thanks to customer relationship management (CRM) systems, firms can be informed about their customers and concentrate their limited resources to customers of more profitable relationships instead of treating every customer equally. However, firms that are practicing this strategy may ignore customers of less profitable relationships. The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether or not it is appropriate for firms to concentrate their customer relationship development resources on the most profitable customer relationships. Our result shows that it may not be optimal for firms to concentrate all resources to those customers. Rather, firms should invest in improving relationships with less profitable customers. This is due to the strategic value of those customers to firms under competition.

J	Lutsenko, AV				Lutsenko, Anton, V			x A.A. BOGDANOV'S OPINION ABOUT THE REASONS OF IDEOLOGICAL CONFLICTS IN RSDRP	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						labour movement; social democracy; Bolshevism; revolution		During the exile in Vologda the future vice-leader of Bolsheviks A. A. Bogdanov (1873-1928) had an opportunity to study of all sets of oppositional political views existing in Tsarist Russia. The scientific analysis of these sights showed that the leaders even of the most radical revolutionary parties were in steady cultural and world-viewing dependence on privileged classes. Proletariat (which was led by them), despite ideological dependency, essentially differed from the intellectual leaders in its position, life style and experience of social cooperation. This circumstance gave rise to obvious contradictions in interaction of the leaders and ordinary members of a party - the foreign-placed leaders-theorists aspired to organize antiauthoritarian revolutionary movement by especially authoritarian methods and led struggle for their leadership in a party instead of organizing methodical agitation and education of proletarians. This work, as Bogdanov said, should have put a start to a really original and independent labour movement. On the basis of the above-stated, the scientist judged that there was an inevitably system divergence between the managing top of RSDRP and ordinary members of the party - not only on the current tactical questions, but also on the strategic purposes and tasks: 1) the main purpose of intellectual leaders was maximum close integration in the existing social and political system; therefore they would be inclined to compromise cooperation with the privileged classes in spirit of opportunism and would focus the proletariat accordingly; 2) the strategic purpose of the proletariat, on the contrary, was a complete transformation of the existing social and political system according to the ideals of socialism and collectivism, inherent in the working class; not having an adequate ideological support from the intellectual leaders, the proletariat would be doomed on the spontaneous forms of the protest representing reaction to policy of the high classes, i.e. on preservation and aggravation of political and world-viewing dependency. The revolution of 1917 looked like a refutation of Bogdanov's conclusion. But "the state-commune" proclaimed by Lenin really converted to a trivial interception of control over the state management system: the organizational methods of the revolutionaries still remained authoritarian, and the proletariat remained its cultural and world-viewing dependency from the leaders. Bogdanov characterized all declarative maxims about the new social order as "the program of adventure", whose natural end could only be a "long dictatorship of the Iron Heel".

The aim of this paper is to analyze the influence of the postponement in an enterprise production system with make-to-stock and with seasonal demand. The research method used was a case study, the instruments of data collection were semi-structured interviews, documentary analysis and site visits. This research is restricted to analysis of the influence that different levels of delay and the company's position in the supply chain have on the practice of demand management in the productive segment graphic, product spiral notebook and also in relation to geographical focus (region of the state Sao Paulo), in which it will seek to interview the managers and directors. As a way to support the research on the analysis of case study and the final considerations will be discussed the following issues: supply chain management, postponement, demand management and production system make-to-stock. The demand management can be understood as a practice that allows you to manage and coordinate the supply chain in reverse, i.e. the consumer to the supplier, in which consumers trigger actions for the supply of products can make the process more efficient. The purpose of managing the supply chain is able to allow the addition of value, exceeding the expectations of consumers, it is necessary to develop a relationship with suppliers and customers win-win. The postponement strategy must fit the characteristics of the turbulent environment within the markets along with demands that require variety of customized products and services and reasonable costs, aiming to support decision making. The postponement of time can be a way to soften the increase in inventory of finished product in the company, which may have a high value, being necessary to reduce the lead time and also suppliers to change their production strategy of make- to-stock to make-to-order. The production system make-to-stock shows enough interest to organizations that are operating in markets with high demand variability, i.e. variations in seasonal as a way of trying to protect their production and be more responsive to market needs.

J	Che Mohd Aziz, Y				Che Mohd Aziz, Yaacob			SEPARATIST CONFLICT IN SOUTHERN THAILAND: ISSUES AND RESOLUTION	JEBAT-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY POLITICS AND STRATEGIC STUDIES			Malay	Article						Patani Conflict; Thai Government; Malay Muslims Of Patani; Policies; Issues And Rebellion		The turmoil and conflict that emerged in 2004 was in essence a sequence of events between the Muslim Malays of Patani in Thailand and the government that began approximately a century ago. The Government of Thailand, especially during the reign of Chulalongkhorn now headed by Abihisit Vijajiva has adopted a magnitude of changes in approaches of conflict resolution. Various approaches have been applied but to avail in successfully bringing peace to the Kingdom. Hitherto, this situation provokes heuristic endeavors on the implementation as it overtly faces a conundrum surmounting conflict and its implications seem to tantamount and simultaneously paramount other conflicting issues. Hence, the Thai government's conflict resolution approach in attempting to solvent key issues (independence) has raised other issues (identity, economy, education and human rights) evokes the OMIP rebellious struggle to continue. Thus, this descriptive analysis will discuss the forms of approaches adopted by the government of Thailand between 1960 and 2011. By employing the theory of political conflict and the conflict resolution management, these lenses will assist this discourse on the intentions behind the approaches to conflict resolution implemented in the territory of Pattani, Narathiwat and Yala. The main findings indicate that the Kingdom of Thailand government's policy approach towards Patani has negative effects and that causes other issues. Through this analysis, there are possibilities indicating that the government attempts to covert its role in addressing issues that arise.

By this approach on representation, we described the organizational reality as a stage where the real "show" of the practices, routines and corporative strategies takes place. There are some delicate aspects in the effective control of the idealized strategies realization, as they exist in the interaction between actors and public. The aim of this article is to deconstruct the thought of an ideal control of the relations between the organizational actors and the processing of strategies, through a dialogue about the paradoxes, dilemmas and risks trespassing the idealization and operation of enterprises strategies.

J	Hindle, GA; Hindle, T				Hindle, G. A.; Hindle, T.			Safety cameras and road accidents: effectiveness in local authority areas in England	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						public expenditure; government; regional studies; transport; regression		Safety cameras have been central to strategy for improving road safety in the UK (and other countries) over the past decade and a National Safety Camera (NSC) programme was introduced in the year 2000 to fund and guide the expansion of camera sites. This programme was brought to an end in 2007 and responsibility for decisions on expanding, maintaining or rolling back safety cameras has now been largely devolved to local highway authorities and their partners. To make strategic choices in such areas it is clearly vital to understand the extent to which safety cameras are effective in reducing road accident potential. Although the NSC programme has been evaluated this work has focussed mainly on assessments of impacts at camera sites rather than wider area effects: particularly local highway area effects. The research reported here has explored the rates of personal injury collisions (PIC) over the past decade on the roads of English Local Authority areas and investigated relationships between area characteristics including levels of safety camera introductions and the PIC improvements (or otherwise) reported. To assist in this analysis, an indicator of safety camera intensity has been derived in this research to reflect the relative likelihood in areas of coming into contact with safety camera sites This work shows that area improvement rates differ significantly on an urban/rural dimension and are also very dependent on prior (to camera introductions) levels of PIC risk. Controlling for these factors using a pair comparison approach, analysis shows that safety camera introduction effects are statistically detectable in very highly urbanised, high PIC risk areas and at high risk sites within areas but not elsewhere. Whilst recognising that new high risk sites can emerge in any area, the conclusion is reached that many local areas and especially more rural areas would be unlikely to gain advantage from a further general expansion of fixed point and mobile camera sites and that de-commissioning of current sites should be seriously considered.

In today:s global competitive business environment, competitiveness is heavily influenced by the ability of the multiple organizations in a supply chain to synchronize and integrate their business activities and processes. Supply chain integration, (SCI) which links the activities, functions, processes, and systems of a firm with its customers and suppliers, can reduce uncertainty, enhance responsiveness, reduce costs, and improve customer service. Empirical studies have explored SCI and reported that information technology (IT) is a key ingredient for the success of the integrated supply chain. While the research on SCI has been reported in OM literature, empirical studies that investigate the impact of different levels of IT utilization (ITU)-strategic, operational, and infrastructural - on SCI are not available. This research also explores the impact of top management support (IMS) on the relationship between ITU and SCI. Based on data collected from 220 manufacturing firms, this study indicates that ITU will have a positive impact on the success of an integrated supply chain when top management is personally involved in the technology implementation process.

J	Nyalungu, V				Nyalungu, Vincent			The application of a Business Intelligence tool for strategic planning in a higher education institution: a case study of the University of the Witwatersrand	TD-THE JOURNAL FOR TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IN SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article						Business Intelligence (BI); Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (BIEE); Data Warehouse; Strategic Decision Making; Strategic Planning; Higher Education Institutions and Knowledge Management	OPPORTUNITIES; ENVIRONMENT; MANAGEMENT	This article presents a discussion on the importance of business intelligence (BI) and the role that a specific BI tool, Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition, plays in the strategic decision-making processes in an organisation. The University of the Witwatersrand, often referred to as Wits, was used as a case study. The main objective of a business intelligence tool is to improve the quality and timeliness of the input of data to the organisational decision-making process. The quality of the data, which is an organisational asset, is therefore of the utmost importance. Approaches for the identification of business intelligence from corporate information and knowledge management were also assessed. A questionnaire was administered among key informants within the university in order to address some of the pertinent issues at higher education institutions. In addition, the role of a data warehouse within the business intelligence framework was presented. The paper itself covers a wide range of disciplines from information technology, knowledge management to decision sciences. The article also presents a proposed framework to be used in line with the best practices in the implementation of business intelligence solutions.

J	Peres, MR; Antonialli, LM				Peres Junior, Miguel Rivera; Antonialli, Luiz Marcelo			Strategic Customer Orientation - Innovation in Incubated Enterprises of the State of Minas Gerais: An Empiric Study, with use of the ICON Scale	REVISTA GESTAO & TECNOLOGIA-JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY			Portuguese	Article						Strategy; Market orientation (MO); Innovation; ICON scale; Business incubators		Many researchers are devoted to investigate the role of the Market Orientation (MO) and innovation play for contemporary companies. This work questioned the way in which the OPM and innovation constructs are being used by companies located in Minas Gerais, which are or have been - hosted in a business incubator. To respond this question, this exploratory study used the ICON (Innovation-Customer Orientation) scale of measurement - developed by Berthon, Hulbert and Pitt (1999) to verify the strategic orientation (Isolate, Follow, Shape or Interact). The results show that all those archetypes were expressed in the sample, being the Interactive archetype the most frequent. The data brought, however, unexpected results, for example, the occurrence of a "hybrid" type with preponderance of two of them. This fact, with other results, seems to indicate the need for revision or extension of the utilized typology, or so far, for a new classification.

J	Tahir, R; Chen, WJ				Tahir, Rizwan; Chen, Weijing			STRATEGIC MOTIVATIONS OF AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND MANUFACTURING FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS	ASIAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Foreign direct investment (FDI); ownership strategies; wholly-owned subsidiary (WOS); joint ventures (JV); Australia; New Zealand		We empirically investigate how different location-specific variables and strategic motives influenced Australian and New Zealand (ANZ) firms' ownership strategy choices in foreign markets between 1998 and 2008. This study is the first to analyse how strategic motives and ownership-specific, location-specific, and internalisation variables have influenced the ownership structure choices of ANZ firms in foreign markets. The results indicate that large market potential and low levels of cultural distance increase the probability that ANZ manufacturing firms will undertake wholly owned subsidiary (WOS) ownership structures and market-seeking (MS) and/or efficiency-seeking (ES) foreign direct investment (FDI). Low exchange rate fluctuation increases the probability that ANZ manufacturing firms will undertake WOS-type risk reduction-seeking (RRS) FDI.

J	Chen, HH; Xing, XQ				Chen, Hsing Hung; Xing, Xiaoqiang			Strategic outsourcing investment in high technology industry	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Analytic Network Process (ANP); Benefits; Opportunities; Costs and Risks (BOCR); strategic outsourcing investment	ANALYTIC NETWORK PROCESS; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; DECISION; SYSTEM; DESIGN; IMPACT	In a highly competitive industry, especially high-tech industry, a firm needs to have appropriate outsourcing strategies in order to survive. However, a firm used to have a strategic dilemma between supplier-oriented strategy and production-oriented strategy. Because of increasing complexity in the socio-economic surroundings along with rapidly changing technologies, how to have a suitable outsourcing investment is becoming an important focus for companies. However, there is no such a research in previous literatures. In order to fill the vacancy, the paper tries to briefly discuss the mechanisms of strategic outsourcing investment, its critical success criteria, and then introduce different evaluation models to help in having suitable outsourcing investment. Finally, the paper finds that an analytic network process (ANP) associated with benefits, opportunities, costs and risks (BOCR), is optimal to help companies to select the most suitable outsourcing investment projects.

There are different models and tools for strategic planning. The model of Balanced Scorecard (BSC) has been noticed by various organizations in recent years due to its special attention to intangible assets of organization like customer, internal processes, growth and learning in addition to financial indexes. Moreover, it is considered as one of the new methods of strategic planning. This research aims at developing a strategy for Mobin Petrochemical Company with a BSC attitude. The present research from the viewpoint of goal is an applied research and in respect of data collection, it uses a qualitative research method (focal group). For the purpose of learning about strategies of Mobin Petrochemical Company, while reviewing texts and literature related to strategic management, the views of senior petrochemical managers was used in the process of focus groups. During various focus meetings held in the presence of senior management body of the organization, the mission and vision of company were determined. Then identifying external opportunities and threats and determining internal weaknesses and strengths of organization and evaluating the IFE and EFE matrixes, the SWOT matrix was formed and strategies of Mobin Petrochemical Company were determined. The motifs of the company strategy were classified from the four main perspectives of BSC model.

J	Chu, HC; Yang, YF; Chen, CY				Chu, Hui-Chin; Yang, Yi-Feng; Chen, Ching-Yaw			The dyadic effect of leadership and conflict management on trust in the context of life insurance companies in Taiwan	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Transformational leadership; organizational conflict management; organizational trust; strategic alliance implementation	TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; MARKET ORIENTATION; PRODUCT QUALITY; CONTRACT DESIGN; PERFORMANCE; COMMITMENT; TECHNOLOGY; INFORMATION	In this study, we discuss the main and dyadic (interconnected) effects of transformational leadership, organizational conflict management on organizational trust in the life insurance industry. We analyze two samples (sales managers and sales employees) and carry out an empirical study using a multiple interaction regression approach to obtain significant results. We compare the dyadic effect with the main effects taking an overall view of leadership-trust linkage. Our main conclusion is that we consistently find an important contribution for the main effects of transformational leadership and organizational conflict management on organizational trust while the dyadic effect plays an interactive role that also helps enhance and uplift the leadership-trust relationship.

J	Liu, FH; Chen, HH				Liu, Feng-Hsu; Chen, Hsiang-Heng			Value creation for the growth of contract manufacturers by technological competence leveraging	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contract manufacturer; competence leveraging; function; growth	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; MARKETING INTERFACE; PRODUCT INNOVATION; CAPABILITIES; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY; FIRMS	Applying existing competence to different end products is an easy and low risk way, vis-a-vis building new competence, for a contract manufacturer (CM) to pursue growth. As such, a CM in effect adopts competence-related diversification. However, there is a strong concentration on value of competence building and neglecting that value is also created by competence leveraging for CMs' growth. Two case studies compared and contrasted two CMs in the composite material and IT industry in Taiwan. A survey of existing literature provided the relevant constructs and concepts for developing a conceptual framework of technological competence leveraging (TCL) functions for CMs' growth. Subsequently, in-depth interviews and secondary data from many sources were compared and analyzed. The results showed five functions of TCL that influence CMs strategic growth and they are: leveraging existing competence into new market; 1) having low risk; 2) utilizing slack resource; 3) displaying the value of competence to buyers; 4) building new competence for future growth; and 5) creating opportunities to build own-brand with low conflicts.

J	Al-Majali, D; Dahalin, ZM				Al-Majali, Damnithan; Dahalin, Zulkhairi Md.			IT - BUSINESS STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT IN INFLUENCING SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN JORDAN: STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING (SEM) APPROACH	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Strategic alignment; alignment gap; information technology; sustainable competitive advantage		In many review articles or studies, the researchers have encouraged further exploration on the causal links between Information Technology (IT) investments and a firm's sustainable competitive advantage. The outcomes of empirical studies have been inconclusive, which is to a certain extent due to the omission of IT-business strategic alignment. Indeed, strategic alignment has emerged as one of the most important issues facing business and IT executives all over the world. This paper reports on the empirical investigation of the success factors, which consist of leadership, structure and process, service quality, and values and beliefs, which are representative of the culture gap between IT strategy and business strategy. A questionnaire survey among 200 IT managers was carried out and 172 data sets were collected. This represented a 86% response rate. After a rigorous data screening process including outliers, normality, reliability and validity, 172 data sets were ready for structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was performed to examine the composite reliability, convergent validity and goodness of fit of the individual constructs and measurement models. The revised structural model demonstrates the relationships between all the four exogenous variables and IT-business strategic alignment, and all the four exogenous variables and sustainable competitive advantage. In addition, regarding the revised model there are two mediating effects of strategic alignment in the relationship between leadership, structure and process, service quality, values and beliefs, and sustainable competitive advantage.

To report the experience of the City Department of Health in Belo Horizonte (SMSA/BH), state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, with the use of information resources management (IRM) to develop a health information system. Methods. In this case study we reviewed documents describing initiatives in the area of information, the mechanisms used to enable these initiatives, and the results achieved with a management system focused on the implementation of an electronic medical records system in the period from 2003 to 2008. This process is described and analyzed from the perspective of IRM. Results. The system contributed to a change in the health care model, resulting from the electronic integration of 103 basic health units, 9 specialized units, and 503 family health teams, with emphasis on information that was relevant for the family health program. Conclusions. The following IRM components were effectively implemented as part of the electronic system: creation of a single locus for the areas of information technology and information, potential leveraging of information technology, and establishment of a strategic forum for information-related decision-making. One limitation refers to the use of strategic information for long-term decision-making.

Widely relying in the beginning on the legacy of the former European HTR developments (DRAGON, AVR, THTR, etc.) that it contributed to safeguard, this program led to advances in HTR/VHTR technologies and produced significant results, which can contribute to the international cooperation through Euratom involvement in the Generation IV International Forum (GIF). the main achievements of the European program, performed in complement to efforts made in several European countries and other GIF partners, are presented: they concern the validation of computer codes (reactor physics, as well as system transient analysis from normal operation to air ingress accident and fuel performance in normal and accident conditions), materials (metallic materials for vessel, direct cycle turbines and intermediate heat exchanger, graphite, etc.), component development, fuel manufacturing and irradiation behavior, and specific HTR waste management (fuel and graphite). Key experiments have been performed or are still ongoing, like irradiation of graphite and of fuel material (PYCASSO experiment), high burn-up fuel PIE, safety test and isotopic analysis, IHX mock-up thermohydraulic test in helium atmosphere, air ingress experiment for a block type core, etc. Now HTR-TN partners consider that it is time for Europe to go a step forward toward industrial demonstration. In line with the orientations of the "Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan)" recently issued by the European Commission that promotes a strategy for development of low-carbon energy technologies and mentions Generation IV nuclear systems as part of key technologies, HTR-TN proposes to launch a program for extending the contribution of nuclear energy to industrial process heat applications addressing (1) the development of a flexible HTR that can be coupled to many different process heat and cogeneration applications with very versatile requirements, (2) the development of coupling technologies for such coupling, (3) the possible adaptations of process heat applications required for nuclear coupling, and (4) the integration and optimization of the whole coupled system. As a preliminary step for this ambitious program, HTR-TN endeavors to create a strategic partnership between nuclear industry and R&D and process heat user industries.

J	Messina, P				Messina, Patrizia			Policies for strategic territorial development. Inter-municipality association as a form of network governance: the Italian experience	EASTERN JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES			English	Article						network governance; public management; local government; strategic planning; regional studies		This paper will discuss the problems involving the forms of association between municipalities in North East Italy from the European perspective. These forms of association may be defined as examples of inter-municipality networks: a concept that allows us to shift emphasis from the rigidity in the organizational structure of every local authority to the flexibility and functionality of relations between the actors in terms of the policies that they mean to share and the different network rationales used according to the choice of the governance model enacted. Planning and encouraging the construction of polycentric networks such as the Union of Municipalities means recognizing and sustaining a governance of functional interdependence, which is at the basis of both the associated administration of services in a homogenous area and strategic planning over a, vast area., via joint action and shared decision-making between the local authorities. This represents a decisive step towards the practice of functional federalism and the construction of new forms of "network" polity.

BREAKING THROUGH THE "BRICK WALL" - USING AN INTERDISCIPLINARY STRATEGY TO MARKET HIGH-TECH PRODUCTS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						New products introduction; inter-disciplinary strategy; firm performance		Marketing high-tech products poses challenges to classically trained marketers who may be unfamiliar with a product's underlying science or technology. Often such marketing teams, lacking scientific backgrounds, find it particularly difficult to interface with R&D and truly understand a product's inner workings - something we show to be critical to fully assessing a product for effective differentiation and marketing. By utilizing a novel marketing strategy, the Interdisciplinary Strategic Marketing Framework, we show the need to hire interdisciplinarians - marketers with science backgrounds - to champion marketing teams which are able to overcome the R&D-to-Marketing communicative "brick wall" and delve into a product's technology, such that it can be marketed most effectively, fully assessing all potential science-based and classical aspects of a marketing campaign. Provided within the framework is a strategy for organizing a firm's marketing functionaries (possibly even integrating them into product development), and a system with which the (interdisciplinarian) marketer can efficiently categorize high-tech products, as well as corresponding methodologies which with to approach differentiating and marketing high-tech products. An illustrative consulting case is also included to demonstrate an application of the marketing methodologies.

CRM Information Assurance by Adding Specificity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY			English	Article						CRM; Information assurance; Confidentiality; Integrity; Denial of service; Specificity; Security; basic belief assignment; Belief function		We propose a CRM specificity enhancer (CSE) capable of information assurance through specifying CRM evidence. We use Dempster and Shafer's theory to process nonspecific customers attributes and their nonspecific purchase behaviors collected by the CRM data and technology components. Customer segmentation is performed while minimizing information conflicts in strategic marketing information generated by the CRM system and used by marketing management to send out marketing offers to targeted customer groups. CRM information assurance, through the CSE model, achieves information confidentiality, data integrity, and system availability. Because information inconsistencies are a great source of information corruption, then CRM integrity will be enhanced by minimizing information conflicts. Also with the absence of such specificity capability then marketing management cannot target the right customers and may hence rely of junk mail and spam to reach more customers. However the more untargeted marketing offers are sent through spam or junk mail the more company information is leaked to the external world. Leaking valuable information about a company's marketing product and strategies violates the confidentiality security goal set by the CRM security policy. Moreover, because the CSE model works in a real time manner by classifying new customers as they arrive, any denial of service by some components of the CRM system will not oblige customers to reject marketing offers but will instead default to the last marketing offers communicated to marketing management before the CRM system is affected by the denial of service incident.

Recent growth in the use of internet services has also provided opportunities for service companies to offer better quality service to their consumers. The main aim of the paper was to carry out the theoretical perception on the role of e-service. The current development in technology have created a powerful movement in knowledge based self service or eservice, and it is also creating a role of differentiation in provision of customer services. The advantages of internet also create a new opportunities for business to construct strategic link with their consumers. A self-complete survey was used to collect data from a convenience sample of 272 Pakistani respondents who use online banking. Factor analysis and structural equation modelling were used to test the proposed model of relationships. Online e-trust, perceived quality and intention to use, have impact on subjective disconfirmation. Subjective disconfirmation does have a relationship to quality and e-loyalty. However, the efficiency dimension of online service quality is related to e-trust and also indirectly to relationship strength through e-trust.

J	Wang, XH				Wang, Xiuhong			Patent Intelligence and business strategy	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Intellectual property strategy; business strategy; patent intelligence; patent analysis		Patents are one of the major sources of technological and competitive information. Patent intelligence is vital for future business success. This paper addresses how patent intelligence can be used to make intellectual property strategy. Many patent analysis methods were used in experimental examples to illustrate worldwide innovation distribution, a competitor's relative patent strength therein and new application of core technology in other fields. This study provides business managers with basis of decision-making for R&D strategy and intellectual property strategy based on patent intelligence research in following sides: (1) Choice of IP strategies: whether to apply for a patent or protect as commercial/technical secret or register trademark. (2) Opportunity and type choices of applying for the patent. (3) International patent prosecution and marketing strategy. (4) Choice of patent strategies: including basic patent strategy, patents siege, patent transfer/licensing, cross-licensing, patent buy, combine patents with products or trademark, strategic use of patents in capital, technology and product output and transfusion strategy.

This will also help in understanding the impacts that are experiencing within site-based management (SBM) with an intention of providing better guideline for institutional improvement. Data gained through questionnaires from 127 principals and 694 teachers using representative sampling technique from urban secondary provision are used. This study reports that some of the items that are considered as the roles of site-based management have impact on organizational improvement. A remarkable school improvement may be achieved if the principals provide special emphasis on strategic planning, supportive and comprehensive roles reducing emphasis on shared decision making. The findings of this study provide important information for policy makers, education managers, and especially for the principals and teachers concerned with the improvement and well-being of secondary schools under the school-based management system.

The aim of this study is to identify the main factors of commitment to human resource development of the Iranian Social Security Organization's Hospitals. To achieve this objective, the main variables were recognized and a questionnaire was designed. Iranian Social Security Organization's Hospitals (as the greatest public non-governmental health institution in Iran) were chosen as a sample among all Iranian healthcare centers (n=96). Content validity and construct validity were assured with expert judgment and the reliability of the questionnaire was determined using Cronbach's alpha and Pearson correlation (1(st) and 2(nd) time). Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.819, while Pearson correlation was 0.951 (p<0.001). The questionnaire was filled out by the research community. After the sample size was proven to be sufficient, exploratory and confirmatory factors were analyzed. The findings of the present research showed that after conducting the factor analysis of the component "commitment", 3 factors were extracted. The factors were "organization development", "management commitment" and "employment system". The calculated fitness indices proved the desirability and appropriateness of the factors and their structural relations.

J	Brocke, H; Uebernickel, F; Brenner, W				Brocke, Henrik; Uebernickel, Falk; Brenner, Walter			Balancing Customer Requirements and IT Service Standardisation A Procedural Reference Model for Individualised IT Service Agreement Configurations	ENTERPRISE MODELLING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article								IT service providers are increasingly urged to stringently align their service portfolio with the IT support of their customers' business processes. Consequently, both IT expenses and its strategic contribution to value creation are expected to become subject to heightened transparency. Yet, in order to allow for standardised on-demand service request processing within the meaning of IT industrialisation, these services appear too adapted to individual customer needs, particularly as they are subject to continuous changes in business requirements. In order to address this issue, a three-phase procedural model of IT service agreement configuration is introduced: IT services thus remain transformable and configurable via predefined complementary services which are selected by configuring a customer's individual service directory. In addition, the reutilisation of modular commitments in order to compose service specifications aims to maintain standardised IT operations. Serving as a procedural reference model, these configuration phases are introduced in detail regarding activities, roles, techniques and data structure as developed and implemented in Action Research cooperation with two IT providers.

Stability of spatial patterns defined by electrical conductivity mapping of soils within sugarcane paddocks	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article						ECa mapping; geo-referenced zones; site-specific management; soil variability; spatial patterns		Information that describes variations in the soil within paddocks can be used for the application of precision agriculture techniques through site-specific management to improve crop production. This paper outlines some of the possibilities for the enhanced recognition of soil-related patterns using maps of apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) responses recorded by a Veris 3100 machine at study sites in the Herbert, Burdekin, and Mackay sugarcane districts (in Australia). The paper demonstrates the stability of deep (0 - 90 cm) soil ECa patterns over a six month fallow period and a five year crop cycle. The map patterns, supplemented by strategic soil description and analysis, are shown to be capable of providing a stable GIS layer that may serve as a surrogate for the soil condition, and as a base for assessing soil-related changes within paddocks, especially in paddocks for which detailed soil maps are not available.

Using a small machinery company as a case study, the paper examines a number of specific management decisions which enabled the company to come out of the crises with dynamics in production, much bigger than prior to the downturn. Comparing available macroeconomic data as at February 2011, the paper sums up some strategic decisions of companies which could have substantially helped to restructure these companies during the crisis period. The final part of the paper suggest some specific directions for applied research in 2011 and the upcoming years, which could result in a deeper knowledge of decision-making processes by production companies' Chief Executives in the Czech Republic.

J	Greasley, S				Greasley, Stephen			Cabinet Governance and Political Stability in English Urban Councils	COMMONWEALTH JOURNAL OF LOCAL GOVERNANCE			English	Article								Policy-makers have long been concerned with the quality of local political leadership and have often resorted to institutional reform to try to improve political leadership. This paper looks at a specific and neglected facet of the political management reforms that have been implemented in English local government over the last decade: the tenure and turnover of cabinet members. The tenure of top politicians may be an important influence on the performance of local government particularly when political management is designed to favour individualised leadership. On the one hand, excessively short tenures for top politicians may damage the ability of governments to develop strategic plans and ensure they are implemented while on the other hand the risk of loss of office is central to political accountability and excessively long tenures may be indicative of an insulated and unresponsive elite. While some research attention has been paid to the tenures of leaders of councils in England there is little systematic information about the tenure of cabinet members. This paper discusses the relevance of cabinet stability and provides an overview of recent experience in England.

J	Raghavan, K				Raghavan, Kamala			Municipal governments' (mis) governance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISCLOSURE AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						municipal government; internal control; Enterprise Risk Management; corporate governance		Since the 1970s, major financial disasters have occurred frequently in the public finance sector leading to taxpayers bearing the losses and paying higher taxes for many years. During the past few decades public entities such as New York City, California's Orange and San Diego Counties, Ohio's Cuyahoga County, and many public funds, local governments and public pension pools have suffered losses due to financing strategies involving excessive leverage and risky derivative trades, and public officials relying on investment bankers' sales presentations without understanding the underlying risks. Jefferson County, Alabama, is the latest case of a large municipal entity at the edge of municipal bankruptcy caused by poor investment policies. Cities including Chicago, Detroit, Denver, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Oakland and Richmond are experiencing financial distress. The states of Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Oregon and entities such as Bay Area Toll Authority are losing money on poorly designed interest rate swaps, and are trying to exit the contracts by paying hefty exit fees. Issues related to fraud and poor internal control procedures are surfacing in municipal entities of all sizes. While public entities have performed quite well in their risk management efforts relating to disasters and terrorist threats, risk management practices relative to financial assets have been quite inadequate. This article reviews some of the reasons leading to the financial disasters, and discusses key components of regulatory reforms proposed to strengthen the municipal securities market and the roles and responsibilities of audit committee members in government entities. It offers a suggested implementation template for public entities' risk management practices based on COSO Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control frameworks and for meeting their strategic objectives combined with better governance and stewardship of taxpayer assets.

In order to do job analysis properly, information regarding the job have to be evaluated accurately and realistically. The originating point of the current research is based on this requirement. Related researches have mainly focused on either traditional or strategic approaches. Current study, however, has blended these two approaches together with systems approach in order to model a job analysis system and develop related documents. The developed job analysis form has been used to collect data from fifty civil engineers. Collected data has been statistically analyzed in order to be used for job analysis of civil engineers.

The study examine the complex relationships among risk's antecedent variables about host country factors and network perspective with a sample of 1,020 manufacturers, the study find that: MNCs perceive lower levels of risk when market potential is greater, infrastructure is better established, or lower level of corruption. Regardless of how MNCs engage in foreign direct investment-whether they actively following the customers or are requested by customers to follow-they perceive higher levels of risk in a host country. With regard to the strategic consequences of risk perceptions, when MNCs perceive higher host country risks, they enhance their level of subsidiary ownership, avoid granting access to local partners and associates, and reduce subsidiaries' autonomy. This study provide practitioners a guide for evaluating the risks associated with investing in foreign markets, furthermore the study also proposes MNCs some strategic alternatives in the face of higher investing risk.

J	Aleksandra, VR				Aleksandra, Romitsyna, V			ECONOMIC POTENTIAL ANALYSIS AS THE BASIS OF STRATEGIC PLANNING OF ROAD FREIGHT TRANSPORT ENTERPRISES	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						strategic planning; economic potential; complex analysis		The article studies the question on the necessity of using a complex analysis of economic potential of road freight transport enterprises for strategic planning process. The reasons causing the necessity of application of strategic planning at road freight transport enterprises are stated, problems which heads of road freight transport enterprises face are allocated. The modern economic situation and set of factors making considerable impact on activity of the enterprises demand from management operative reaction to changes both in the external, and in the internal environment of the enterprise. Owing to it the strategic planning acquires great value, as providing stability of activity of the enterprises in a long-term prospect. Forming long-term strategic plans of activity of the enterprises allows development of accurate sequence of actions and raise of validity of accepted management decisions. Considering it, actions and decisions of heads cannot consist only in reaction to changes of the external environment and their influence on the enterprise condition. The head should expect and consider a set of factors, both external and internal, that will allow grounding decisions and making better choices. Special attention in the article is given to the question of analysis of economic potential; the emphasis that the analysis stage is a rod stage of strategic planning of the enterprises is made. The structure of a complex analysis of the economic potential is presented and the basic constituting components are listed. Such approach to studying the possibilities, elements and structure of resources, the external environment and its influence on the enterprise, in particular, enterprises of road freight transport, allows making most sound management decisions. It also gives a chance to trace the influence of changes of the environment and previously implemented events on enterprise conditions, which, in its turn, helps in introducing corrective amendments in long-term plans in due time. Constant monitoring of potential of the enterprise is pledge of an effective utilization of resources; the information received as a result of similar monitoring gives a chance to implement the most significant directions with the minimum costs of time, forces and resources. The problem mentioned in the given article is topical not only for road freight transport enterprises, but also for enterprises of other industries.

Composition and interaction issues have been the central concerns, because SOC applications are composed of heterogeneous and distributed processes. To tackle the complexity of inter-organizational service integration, the authors propose a methodology to decompose complex process requirements into different types of flows, such as control, data, exception, and security. The subset of each type of flow necessary for the interactions with each partner can be determined in each service. These subsets collectively constitute a process view, based on which interactions can be systematically designed and managed for system integration through service composition. The authors illustrate how the proposed SOC middleware, named FlowEngine, implements and manages these flows with contemporary Web services technologies. An experimental case study in an e-governmental environment further demonstrates how the methodology can facilitate the design of complex inter-organizational processes.	[Chiu, Dickson K.

J	Higgins, J; Parsons, R				Higgins, Joanna; Parsons, Ro			IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MATHEMATICS IN NEW ZEALAND: A DYNAMIC APPROACH TO THE POLICY PROCESS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION			English	Article						implementation policy; intervention at scale; mathematics education; policy process; professional development; student outcomes	IMPLEMENTATION	Intervention at scale with the aim of improving student participation, engagement and outcomes in mathematics education is a challenge for educational policy makers and reformers. This article argues that an iterative annual cycle of policy formulation, implementation and evaluation enabled ongoing adjustments to the strategic focus, the professional development model and the system infrastructure as the New Zealand Numeracy Development Project was taken to scale. The analysis draws on the project's evaluation data over a 6-year period to demonstrate how adjustments were made over time to the pedagogical tools and to the professional development processes. The ongoing development of knowledge supported the management of strategic risks in taking the project to scale: the ongoing appropriation of adequate levels of resourcing to support the school-based professional development model and the availability of system-wide expertise for effective implementation. The analysis suggests that conceptualising implementation as an interdependent and interrelated component of an iterative policy process and as an opportunity for knowledge building ensured a continuing focus on student outcomes. The dynamic approach to the policy process appeared central to building this intervention's effectiveness and feasibility at scale.

J	Umar, H				Umar, Haryono			Government Financial Management, Strategy for Preventing Corruption in Indonesia	SOUTH EAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Corruption; accountability; good governance; performance; financial management		In popular view, the term accountability generally refers to a wide spectrum of public expectations dealing with organizational performance, responsiveness, good governance, and even morality of government and nonprofit organizations. These expectations often include implicit performance criteria - related to obligations and responsibilities - that are subjectively interpreted and sometimes even contradictory. And in this broader conception of accountability, the range of people and institutions to whom public and nonprofit organizations must account include not only higher authorities in the institutional chain of command but also the general public, the news media, peer agencies, donors, and many other stakeholders (Kearns, 1996). Government could build its accountability by implementing good and proper financial management. Financial management is a tool for government to show its performance and accountability to the public. Meanwhile, corruption is the misuse of public office for private gain. As such, it involves the improper and unlawful behavior of public-service officials, both politicians and civil servants, whose positions create opportunities for the diversion of money and assets from government to them and their accomplices (Langseth, 1999). The more corruption, the more far away from good governance, and the less public accountability. According to Klitgaard (1988), power minus accountability is corruption. This paper explains about the influences of implementing government financial management to corruption fighting and good governance in broadly view. Discussion will be derived to find out the understanding of financial management, corruption, and good governance terminology fits for Indonesia environment. The purpose of this paper is to achieve common knowledge that financial management should be implemented by public organization from strategic management for public organization approaches. Besides, reader will find out explanation from both theoretical approach and pragmatical approach as well.

J	Bulbul, H				Bulbul, Hasan			A taxonomy of manufacturing strategies: A study of the Turkish automotive industry	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Manufacturing strategy; taxonomy; performance; ownership; automotive industry	COMPETITIVE PRIORITIES; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; BUSINESS; AMT; IMPLEMENTATION; ENVIRONMENT; COMPETENCE; MANAGEMENT	The aim of this study is to explore the existence of different patterns of manufacturing strategies and the relationship between these patterns and firm performance in the Turkish automotive industry. Apart from the scarce taxonomic studies in the operations strategy literature, this research focuses on a single industry and examines the relationship between the firm ownership and strategic types. Three different strategic types (differentiators, intermediators and low emphasizers) are identified based on taxonomy of 31 international and leading automotive firms operating in Turkey. The three types do not differ from each other in terms of ownership, but they do differ significantly in terms of growth performance. Furthermore, it is observed that the findings partially support the sand cone model and the underlying dimensions that described West European manufacturers.

J	Liu, WH; Xu, XC				Liu, Wei-hua; Xu, Xue-cai			Empirical study on strategic transformation to supply chain service of FTCLCs under global financial crisis	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Financial crisis; strategic transformation; supply chain service; capability combination model	CORE CAPABILITY; PERFORMANCE; PROVIDERS; INTEGRATION; IMPACT	Under the global financial crisis, changes in external environment have positive impacts on strategic transformation of Foreign Trade-based Chinese Logistics Corporations (FTCLCs) to supply chain service. The paper adopts a seven-point Likert Scale analysis method and conducts a survey with questionnaire, and then makes factor analysis method to find out a necessary enterprise capability combination. The results indicate that there are 5 crucial factors which affect strategic transformation of FTCLCs: Operational capability inside, Strategy management capability, Profit mode capability, Flexible operation capability, and Control capability of operation, known as OSPFC. Moreover, the way to use OSPFC capability combination is discussed in detail in this paper. This paper would be useful for FTCLCs to detect capability defectives when making strategy decisions. Finally an empirical example, Shanghai Xinhai custom brokerage company in China is exemplified for reference.

J							Cegelec Deutschland	Cegelec Germany	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								Cegelec is a group of companies acting internationally and one of Europe's biggest plant engineering firms in the fields of power generation and distribution with the focus on engineering and technical services. Cegelec's competences in Germany are mainly in planning, installation and maintenance of plants and facilities in all key industries and for public clients. The main areas of activity are industry, infrastructure and power, for which Cegelec offers comprehensive project and service work. While the Industry business area covers chemistry, steel, paper, automotive, re-engineering, and mining industries, Cegelec's Infrastructure unit performs services to airports, in tunnel construction, for railways and waterways. The Power market segment comprises gas, refuse incineration, power supply, sugar, power plants, and nuclear final storage. Cegelec is represented in Germany on roughly 30 locations with a staff of 1,700. The origins of Cegelec are in Germany, i.e. in AEG founded 1896. The Plant and Automation Technology sector was divested in 1996 and moved to Alstom where, in 2001, a management buyout led to the independent Cegelec group of companies. When the strategic partnership between Qatari Diar and Vinci took shape, Cegelec became a subsidiary of the Vinci group in April 2010.

Unpacking the Effects of Corporate Venture Capital Investor Ties on the Reduction of Price Discounting among IPO Firms	ENTREPRENEURSHIP RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article						corporate venture capital investor; market-newness liabilities; initial public offerings; underpricing	INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; S-AND-P-500 INDEX; MARKET; CERTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; INFORMATION; REPUTATION	We examine how ties to different kinds of corporate venture capital (CVC) investors help new ventures overcome the liabilities of market newness they encounter when seeking to undergo an initial public offering (IPO). We analyze a sample of 315 IPO firms with ties to CVC investors and find that the offering price is less discounted when these CVC investors are part of a commercial bank, or in a company that is a member of a major stock exchange. We also find that the effect of an affiliation with a CVC investor in a company that is a member of a major stock exchange is stronger in hot markets than in cold markets, while an affiliation with a CVC investor in a commercial bank is not. Our results suggest that the IPO market recognizes that know-how and prominence based signals conveyed by CVC investor affiliations provide additive reductions of price discounting, and that the certification value that prominence based signals provide also depends on the market conditions in which the IPO takes place.

AN INTEGRATIVE MODEL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGY COMPLEX	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING CULTURE			English	Article						Emerging technology complex; strategic alliance; technology venture; corporate entrepreneurship		The term emerging technology complex (ETC) is associated with companies that wish to diversify into a technology related business by setting up a new venture in parallel with their existing core business. ETC strategy has been widely adopted by many traditional companies due to the advance of technology and the changing market environment, but its resulting performance varies depending largely on how it is operated, i.e. the internal factors. This study explored which of these internal factors are important in affecting the development and growth of ETCs. Four companies with ETC setup were selected for the study; two were more successful while two were less successful. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted. The findings indicate that the success of ETC is due to internal cooperation in an entrepreneurial environment and the implementation of an organic organisational form. A development model for successful ETC is recommended in the conclusion of the paper.	[Lau, Theresa; Chan, K.

A cross-cultural comparison of organisational commitment amongst vehicle sales staff	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SOUTH-AFRICA; ANTECEDENTS; DIVERSITY; ABSENTEEISM; INDUSTRY	The automotive industry is regarded as being critical to the economic growth of South Africa (Horn, 2007). As the achievement of organisational goals occurs largely through the performance of committed human resources (Nijhof, De Jong & Beukhof, 1998), the purpose of the present study was to gain a deeper understanding of the differences in organisational commitment amongst different language groups (language being a proxy of culture) of vehicle sales staff at a large South African motor retailer. The unit of analysis for the study was individual employees (n=314) and the data were collected through the administration of the TCM survey questionnaire developed by Allen and Meyer (1990) to measure affective, normative and continuance commitment. The majority of respondents (36,90%) were African language speakers, 32,30% were English language speakers and 3,60% were Afrikaans language speakers. Results indicate that African language respondents scored significantly lower on normative commitment than did either the Afrikaans or English respondents. No significant differences in normative commitment were observed between the Afrikaans and English respondents. Given the strategic importance of the automotive industry to the South African economy, this finding could alert managers to the necessity of understanding the reasons for the lower normative commitment of the African language group (compared to the Afrikaans and English speakers) and, accordingly, to devise ways of increasing normative commitment with this group.

A two-phase ergonomics project to reduce employee fatigue and discomfort was planned, implemented, and evaluated in a microscope user environment within a high-technology manufacturing environment. Total Quality Management methodology and tools were employed by a multidisciplinary team led by an occupational health nurse practitioner to accomplish the project goals. A multifaceted approach including equipment changes, administrative changes, and focused training for behavior changes achieved the desired reduction in reports of fatigue and discomfort among microscope users.

J	Dobson, W				Dobson, Wendy			Deeper Integration between Canada and India?	MARGIN-JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Canada; India; Free Trade Agreement; Revealed Comparative Advantage; Gravity Analysis		Relative to their economic sizes, structures and linkages, the bilateral relationship between Canada and India is too small. Trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) flows are gradually increasing within such sectors as finance, energy, power and environmental services, agriculture and information technology (IT) services. Two channels are identified to expand this economic footprint: deeper linkages among bilateral business groups to reduce Canadians' transactions costs relative to those in the United States (US) market; and improved market access for India's competitive low-cost producers. Governments, which focus primarily on incremental improvements, should elevate the bilateral relationship to a strategic level with the negotiation of a free trade agreement (FTA). Although each government prefers the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the venue for liberalising agricultural trade, it is argued that a services-only FTA would yield mutual gains by removing many of the restrictions affecting both domestic markets and foreign entrants in the two countries revealed by the comparative analysis in this paper.

J	Murakami, Y; Shimizu, M; Ikada, Y				Murakami, Yoshinobu; Shimizu, Masatomo; Ikada, Yoshito			A new protease assay system using gelatin thin film for monitoring indoor air quality	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING			English	Article							ACTIVATED RECEPTOR-2; CYTOKINE RELEASE; MITE ALLERGENS; DER-P-1; ENZYMES; DER-F-1; CELLS	Airborne particulates have a major influence on the quality of indoor environments, which in turn affects human health. Both allergens and proteases are major etiological factors in allergic disease. Thus, the monitoring of environmental protease particulates is very important for the management of allergic disease. Protease-monitoring systems have been introduced in industry, but have not been applied to domestic settings, probably because of the high cost and many complex steps involved in these systems. In this study, we developed an indoor protease-monitoring system which can easily detect protease particulates without need for pre-treatment of dust samples or complex measuring instruments such as fluorescent plate reader. As a protease substrate, gelatin thin film (GTF) was adopted to evaluate small amounts of house dust particulates. The principle of this assay is based on the hydrolysis of GTF. Protease molecules spread from a particulate to GTF can hydrolyze the gelatin, thereby producing a spot on the GTF. This hydrolyzed spot visualized by staining was much larger than the particulate size, making visible to naked eye. The GTF method facilitated the observation of a subtle increase in protease particulates fallen on the GTF after the turnover of a used bed-quilt. The newly developed GTF method seems to be a suitable tool for protease monitoring at home.

J	Ruslan, GP				Ruslan, Pozhidayev G.			THREE APPROACHES TO COMPREHENSION OF NETWORK ORGANIZATION	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						network organizations; interrelations; interdependences; co-ordination; economic efficiency; relation rent		Complexity and dynamics of most branches of world economy are constantly growing, which stimulates companies to search for new ways to fit the shifting conditions. In the last decades one of the most popular ways is inter-firm cooperation creation and development of different forms of network organizations. Although the researches of network organizations are notably in demand, at present, only several aspects of their functioning are well grounded. Those are the classification of inter-firm network, benefits and value interrelations for partners and consumers, interdependences, concentration and allocation of resources flow between partners, the role of knowledge and competence interchange. This is connected, at least, with two main reasons. First of all, it is the universal nature of the network principle. Since a network is a complex of firm relations between objects (which preserve relative independence from one another), the notion is applicable to a broad circle of objects and phenomena. Within network organizations strictly, this principle is used for a whole complex of relations between companies in and out of partnerships. Secondly, network organizations are complicated and multilateral objects of analysis, since we deal with a combination of several complex systems and, as a result, get a new system with features unequal to the total of features of source elements. In practice, this means that any form of companies' integration has a variety of aspects, which are not regular for a single firm business activity. The complex of versatility and complicity defines different approaches to comprehension of network organizations and specifics of their activity. The three main approaches were elaborated by sociology of economics, interrelation marketing and strategic management. The conceptions developed within the main approaches, explain different aspects of creation and development of inter-firm networks, interrelations and interdependences, sources of value and competitive advantage, co-ordination and network organizations' management, which defines the mutually complementary character of the studies. Network organizations' researches are an integral part of modern firm theory, however, having a unique object of analysis it should develop on its own scientific base, which explains the network principle as a form of organization, its characteristics and conditions of effective inter-firm network model formation.

Thus, they build up invisible networks. Leisure and recreation facilities are one of the imperative components for socio-cultural, psychological, and economic development. In the spectrum of sustainable development, it is not possible to initiate development process without strategically planning for leisure and recreation activities. KFUPM was developed with specific leisure and recreation facilities for its community members. This paper examines their adequacy and possible set of actions to minimize the inadequacies in relation to growing and changing needs of the diversified-culture based community. Preparation of a proposed alterative (strategic) action plan to improve leisure and recreation facilities is based on conducting an internal assessment of current and forecasting amenities, and the need-gap analysis. The proposed action plan covers the estimated cost and urgency level for each of the alternative leisure and recreation improvement options. KFUPM must be committed to embracing the vision and strategies presented by this study, and allocate resources to implement strategic plans for improving leisure and recreation facilities that foster productivity and help shape systems for human resource development.

In addition, very little information systems research tests the link between information technology (IT) and development of a culture supporting innovation. Nor have these literatures properly analysed if and how IT could moderate the interface between learning in alliances and innovative capabilities. This study examines the relationships between learning in alliances, IT management and innovation-supportive culture, placing special emphasis on testing the moderating role of IT management in the relationship between learning in alliances and innovation-supportive culture. Using survey data from a sample of 203 Spanish firms we find that both learning in alliances and IT management positively affect innovation-supportive culture. Further, the results support the moderating role of IT management capability in the relationship between learning in alliances and innovation-supportive culture.

Developing an IT organisational design framework based on operations strategy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICES TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						information technology; operations strategy; organisational design		Information technology has been used as a key strategic resource to sustain companies' competitive positions. As a supportive system or infrastructure, the IT role is well explored and understood, but its use for generating new business opportunities is relatively unexplored. IT management complexity is not only explained by technological alternatives available, but also by its close relationship with organisational changing processes and its contribution to strategy development. Enterprises are studying new organisational design models and solutions to deal with IT complexity and to better explore its strategic potential. This paper study alternatives for IT organisational design, based on operations strategy requisites. The proposed concepts are tested in a case study that explores a real organisational design revision process and its integration to the company operations strategy. The presented results organise the discussion about the IT role in operations, using an operations strategy framework. Organisational design review recommendations emerge from this discussion, essentially founded in IT and operations strategy alignment.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHILDBIRTH			English	Article						general practitioners; multidisciplinary education; midwifery; maternity care; remote and rural setting	INTRAPARTUM CARE; PRACTICE UNIT; 2 SYSTEMS; DELIVERY; CONSULTANT; LABOR; COMPETENCES; MANAGEMENT; SERVICES; HEALTH	BACKGROUND: In the United Kingdom, general practitioner (GP) involvement in maternity care has declined significantly over the past decade. This is particularly so in remote and rural areas where midwives have stepped up and taken over units to ensure that women in these areas continue to have a service. A recent report by the King's Fund argues for a greater role for the GP in maternity care provision; however, this raises questions about whether GPs have the skills and training to provide such care. AIM: To explore the views of GPs on the skills and training required to deliver safe and appropriate local intrapartum services in remote and rural settings. METHODS: Mixed-method study consisting of qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of GPs in six remote and rural sites. To triangulate the interview findings and identify features that might have been missed in the interviews, a questionnaire was developed using initial key themes identified. FINDINGS: Maternity care accounted for less than 10% of most remote and rural GPs' workload, yet interviewees reported that their role required them to be competent in a wide range of procedures. This was seen as a major barrier to recruitment and retention in rural areas. Although self-reported competence and confidence was high, several GPs felt de-skilled and felt that they were fighting a losing battle to maintain skills. GPs regarded isolation, need for comprehensive expertise, limited resources, and transportation difficulties as factors affecting the decline in their contribution to remote and rural maternity care. CONCLUSION: Although rural GPs and midwives might traditionally have been in competition, providing a woman-centered service in remote areas may be easier to achieve through collaborative working. However, if GPs are to play a greater role, then they will need to be prepared to make a strategic commitment to the maintenance of remote and rural maternity care. This will require innovative methods of training, special consideration of educational needs, and incentives for practitioners to settle in rural areas, but it may already be too late for GPs to have a substantial input into maternity care.

This study examines a sample of 208 Taiwan-owned IT-related firms (158 located in Taiwan and 50 located in China) to explore the impacts of resource dependence and dedicated alliance functions on relationships and performance. The sample is divided into Taiwan-based and China-based Taiwanese businesspeople to test the path effects of the conceptual framework. The results show that an alliance relationship provides key effects for performance and satisfaction. We reveal that Taiwanese firms show a willingness to form an alliance relationship, whereas China-based Taiwanese businesspeople show greater consideration of overall operational strategy, valuing alliance performance over relationships.

J	Chiao, TC; Hassan, Z				Chiao, Tina C.; Hassan, Za'faran			Training relevant in achieving strategic competitiveness "A supply chain management perspective"	JOURNAL OF STATISTICS & MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Pearson's correlation; cluster analysis and structural equation modeling		This paper examines the relationship between training in supply chain management (SCM) and competitive advantage of manufacturing companies in Malaysia. The study measures senior SCM managers' or production managers' perception of training in SCM practices and level of competitiveness in the industry. Associations between training in supply chain management and competitive advantage are analyzed through methods such as Pearson's correlations, cluster analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) utilizing 115 respondents' data. The findings suggest that training in SCM has significant correlations with competitive advantage (comprises of determinants such as product differentiation, employee differentiation, service differentiation and price differentiation). Specifically, competitive advantage (CA) has high correlations with training variables such as 'adequacy of production training among employees', 'management training in supply chain effectiveness' and 'employee training in supply chain technologies'. The SEM result also reveals that training in SCM exhibit direct impact on competitiveness. Findings of the study provide a demonstration of the importance of training in enhancing competitiveness in Malaysian manufacturing companies.

J	Ghobadian, A; O'Regan, N				Ghobadian, Abby; O'Regan, Nicholas			Successful strategy making in Bupa not-for-profit provident A case study and interview with Mr Ray King, chief executive of Bupa	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategy; Strategic decisions; Strategic innovation; Strategic leadership; Organic growth; External growth; Innovation; Non-profit organizations		Purpose - The focus of extant strategy literature is on for-profit organisations and within these group public organisations. There are other forms of organisations and following the deep recession of 2008 there is greater interest in other forms of organisation. In this case study and interview the aim is to examine strategy, strategic decisions and strategic management of a not-for-profit provident. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on documentary evidence and a semi-structured interview with Ray King, chief executive of Bupa. The perspective of CEO is key in strategy and such perspectives are relatively rarer. Findings - Bupa invests its surplus to provide better healthcare. Free from the pressures of quarterly reporting and shareholders it can pursue long-term value creation for members rather than short-term surpluses. Research limitations/implications - The case study and interview offers a unique insight into strategy-making within a successful mutual provident that has grown organically and externally becoming an international leader in health insurance. Originality/value - This case study sheds light on strategy-making within a not-for-profit provident that has diversified and grown significantly over the past six decades. Furthermore, very few case studies offer insight into the thinking of a chief executive who has successfully managed a business in a turbulent environment.

J	Ghosn, F				Ghosn, Faten			Domestic Unrest and the Initiation of Negotiations	INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION-A JOURNAL OF THEORY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						conflict; conflict management; domestic pressure; linkage politics; negotiation		The main argument of this article is that we need to incorporate domestic-pressure arguments into conflict management studies and, at the same time, we need to include conflict-management opportunities in the study of domestic-international theory. This study looks at the impact of domestic incentives on a state's decision to negotiate. The primary hypothesis is that domestic turmoil will increase the likelihood that rival states with a history of aggressive interaction shift their foreign policy to a more accommodative one. Testing my argument on strategic rivals between 1945 and 1995, I find that after controlling for the factors of history and level of hostility between the rivals, anti-government unrest actually increases the likelihood of negotiations taking place, while acts threatening the downfall of the regime tend to decrease the chance of witnessing negotiations.

J	Goytia, A; Arosteguy, A				Goytia, Ana; Arosteguy, Agustin			Analysing the Public Cultural Supply Leisure as an innovative tool for the generation of values	ENCATC JOURNAL OF CULTURAL MANAGEMENT AND POLICY			English	Article						Concept of value; Social values; Social identity; Social capital	BEHAVIOR	Culture managed by the public sector has always been a demagogic tool used for the benefit of the government in power. However, the necessary time, resources (human and financial), nor the detailed strategic planning required for such a fragile and crucial aspect have been dedicated to this when identifying a society, country or region. Particularly in such a globalised world as ours, it is time that the public sector truly realises the power involved in using this tool to strengthen social identity and create social capital. This project tries to throw light on the radical importance of thinking through and planning the supply of public cultural activities, as they implicitly entail values (social, cultural, individual, among others) that make up the identity of a people and make them unique in the eyes of the world. Therefore the aim of this project is to study the way in which two municipalities of the Basque Country handle their cultural activities and define what types of social values are behind those activities.

J	Gu, JW; Ching, WK; Siu, TK				Gu, Jia-Wen; Ching, Wai-Ki; Siu, Tak-Kuen			A Markovian infectious model for dependent default risk	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						dependent default risk; Markovian infectious model; common shocks; multi-sector models; chain reaction; crisis risk measures		Modelling dependent defaults has long been a central issue for credit risk measurement and management. To address this important issue, we introduce a Markovian infectious model to describe the dependent relationship of default processes of credit securities. The central tenant of the proposed model is the concept of common shocks which is one of the major approaches to describe insurance risk. Using real data default data, we compare the proposed model to some existing default risk models, such as one-sector and two-sector models discussed in Ching et al. (2008, 2010). A log likelihood ratio test is adopted for the purpose of model comparison. Our empirical results reveal that the proposed model outperforms both the one-sector and two-sector models. We also illustrate the application of the proposed model for quantitative risk measurement. In particular, numerical results for both the crisis value-at-risk and the crisis expected shortfall are provided.

J	Hameed, SA				Hameed, Shihab A.			STRATEGY AND POLICY STATEMENTS ON GREEN ICT: AN ISLAMIC PERSPECTIVE	IIUM ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						green ICT; ICT professionals; strategy statement; environment problem; Islamic perspective		In this information and knowledge era; ICT development and industry are growing very fast and associated with huge procurement force. Today, the global society is facing serious challenges in improving environmental performance, particularly with climate change, global warming, and resource management. ICT industry is widely contributing to the global economy associating with innovation, invention and rapid development of almost all the aspect of human life. On other hand; ICT industry is responsible for global CO2 emissions. Global environmental problems are affecting directly many countries' energy and industrial policies. The rapid increasing of ICT usage means more energy consumption and more environmental problems and the estimated ICT consumption of energy will be about 15% of the total consumption worldwide in 2020. Therefore, many countries are establishing Green ICT policies which increase energy efficiency due to correspondence climate change. Therefore, governments especially in developing and Islamic countries need to adopt new strategic policies for efficient energy use in ICT. This study presents the current environmental problems related to green ICT and the efforts to solve it. Several studies have warning from the current energy consumption paradigm, based on newly changed ICT practices. This study provides guidelines for decision makers and ICT professionals to enhance their work toward green ICT and eliminating environmental problems. Islamic viewpoint on environment and its protection is considered since it offers comprehensive, stable, and fair viewpoint that is based on main Islamic sources; Qur'an and Sunnah.

J	Holtzhausen, L; Fourie, L				Holtzhausen, Lida; Fourie, Lynnette			Employer-employee relationships at Lonmin Platinum: A developing South African perspective	COMMUNICATIO-SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL FOR COMMUNICATION THEORY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						Developing context; employer-employee relationships; Lonmin Platinum; relationship management; relationship theory; stakeholder management		More than ever, companies are confronted with the importance of developing and maintaining relationships with their strategic stakeholders, such as employees. These relationships should be aimed at balancing the interests of the company with the interests of said stakeholders. Managing relationships with stakeholders is difficult in itself and even more so within the complex context of the South African mining industry. The aim of this article is to determine guidelines that could be used to ascertain employer-employee relationship type and relationship quality in the mining sector. In 2004, a quantitative questionnaire survey was conducted with a stratified quota sample of 508 company employees as part of a commissioned stakeholder perception survey. In addition, qualitative focus-group sessions were conducted to contextualise and clarify the quantitative results. The research indicated that the employer-employee relationship at Lonmin Platinum could be classified as an exchange, rather than a communal relationship. Employees generally perceived the quality of their relationship with the company in a negative way. Employees from all job levels had low levels of trust in the company. This study contributes to a growing body of research aimed at trying to understand the nature of employer-employee relations within large companies in a developing society, where companies are faced with the challenge of communicating to and managing diverse workforces.

Based on our previous work, we describe them and suggest how to evaluate them including scales and measures, if possible. Then we concentrate on the pedagogical criteria and show their utilization for the efficiency evaluation of the multimedia lectures. For this purpose, we divided the students into two groups based on the frequency of utilizing the multimedia lectures for their study, and used the methods of statistical analysis. In particular, we applied two-sample F-test to know whether the variances of students' results are significantly different or not and an appropriate version of the t-test to know whether mean values of students' results are significantly different or not. The case study is based on the data acquired form the students' performance measurement in two specific subjects taught in the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague in 2010 and 2011.

This takes the form of a framework that captures how managers make IT architecture choices and how those choices impact an organization's competitive position. Based on microeconomic theory, the framework provides a set of conceptualizations for understanding alignment, plus some recommendations on how organizations should approach IT architecture adoption in a way that assures optimal alignment with strategic goals. The most important facilitating factor for the framework is the commitment to complete, accurate, and unbiased cost and quality assessment of business processes and their supporting IT infrastructure.

J	Kannabiran, G; Sundar, S				Kannabiran, Ganesan; Sundar, Srinivasan			Relevance of Information Systems Strategic Planning Practices in E-Business Contexts	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IN ORGANIZATIONS			English	Article						Developing Countries; E-Business Strategy; India; IS Strategy; IS Value; Planning Parameters	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; E-COMMERCE; FIRM PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; ALIGNMENT; ASSIMILATION; IMPLEMENTATION; ORGANIZATIONS; CAPABILITIES	Increasing global competition and advances in Internet technologies have led organizations to consider e-business strategies. However, evolving e-business strategies have been identified as a critical issue faced by corporate planners. The relevance and the use of IS (Information Systems) strategy planning practices in the context of e-business have been argued among researchers. In this paper, the authors investigate whether organizations can successfully improve the IS value in the e-business context by suitably extending and mod icing IS planning practices. To achieve this objective, the authors use a longitudinal case study of an Indian automotive manufacturer to critically evaluate 'why' and 'how' e-business strategies differ from IS strategies. The authors compare and analyze five important planning parameters (strategic alignment, technological environment, formalization, role of the IS function, and implementation planning) and the IS value of both IS and e-business contexts. The research reveals that the e-business contexts are characterized by significant changes in planning parameters. Extending IS planning experiences and proper management of these parameters results in successful e-business strategies. The paper is concluded with a set of implications for deploying e-business strategies in developing countries and directions for future research.

J	Khoury, N; Perrakis, S; Savor, M				Khoury, Nabil; Perrakis, Stylianos; Savor, Marko			Competition, interlisting and market structure in options trading	JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE			English	Article						Contingent claims; Market microstructure; Interlisting; Oligopoly games	BID-ASK SPREADS; LISTINGS; LIQUIDITY; INDEX	This paper applies a game theory approach to examine the effects of a market structure change in options trading from a monopoly to a Cournot-type oligopoly that occurred in two successive periods on the Montreal exchange. We analyze the intra-day behaviour of option bid-ask spreads and find that cross-listing has a differential impact on spreads, affecting quoted but not effective spreads under oligopoly. We also find that the impact of the change in structure on effective spreads comes mostly from an increase in limit orders and is consistent with a switch from Cournot to Bertrand-type strategic behaviour for such orders. We conclude that market structure effects within an options exchange are enough to realize most of the benefits of inter-market competition even in the context of market thinness.

So a subject of strategic management is the production relations and economic interests of the managing subjects. If we want the system of interests to be coordinated, it is necessary to create conditions when different interests of managing subjects would be coincided with the company purposes.	[Kirsanov, N.

J	Law, K				Law, Kris			Social responsibility in youth service organizations: Hong Kong evidence	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article						social responsibility; motivating factors; social welfare organizations; youth service organizations	CORPORATE; MODEL; GREEN	The paper attempts to investigate the key factors affecting the social responsibility development in social welfare organizations. The study also measures how social welfare organizations are performing towards the social responsibility objectives. This paper focuses on a study undertaken among a number of youth service organizations in Hong Kong. The results showed that youth service organizations perceive they have supportive organizational culture and the management has been showing strong willingness in promoting social responsibility. The people from a senior level see that the motivating factors are more important than the junior people, but they perceive the 'social pressure' is less important than the junior people. The big contrast implies that the management people do not take 'social pressure' into serious consideration. The study reveals a significant influence from the management on the adoption and implementation of social responsibility activities. This further confirms the importance on promoting social responsibility at the operational level, with the top management providing clear strategic direction, and supportive resources and environment.

The process of selecting core technologies from promising digital services is illustrated by applying the basic concept of digital life to the field of wireless telecommunications in Korea. The article also explores several social, legal, and strategic issues for the successful deployment of digital life and suggests a stepwise approach for an efficient promotion policy. It further proposes that the government should make efforts to create new markets for firms involved in providing digital life equipment and software, by beginning the digitalisation of public services and reinvesting both in the development of a diverse range of more attractive digital services, and in lowering the service prices.

Nicolina; Recanatesi, Fabio			CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING THE PLANNING OF PROTECTED AREAS ARISING FROM A STUDY OF THE TUSCANIA NATURAL RESERVE (CENTRAL ITALY)	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Protected areas; land planning; landscape protection; participated planning		Following the increase in protected territories over recent years, emphasis has been laid on improving nature conservation and management effectiveness. In particular, special attention has been given to areas where the interaction between people and the environment has produced a distinct character, rich in both ecological and cultural values. Such areas are known as Protected Landscapes and require a special planning and management focus, in which relevant weight is given to local people. The aim of this research is to present a planning process case study in central Italy (Tuscania, north of Rome), where the protected area plan tackles nature conservation and environmental concerns (i.e. water quality, soil conservation, landscape restoration etc.). The results are of general interest because they are the fruit of an experience in debating and improving both the plan's contents and planning methods. In particular, they show: i) the primary role of local people in the various phases of planning, including delicate decisions such as the park's limits and its buffer area; ii) that a protected area plan should not be strictly prescriptive, but should have the role of a strategic master plan; iii) that the protected area policy should be emphasised in the park regulations document, rather than in rigid territorial zoning.

As one of the important factors threatening human security, global environmental change has become a new challenge to the national security and social development. The national security problems caused by global environmental change, on one hand, are closely related to the global environmental problems, and, on the other hand, are manifested in the conflicts of international affairs. The global environmental change severely challenges the future development of China. When it comes to the study on human dimensions of global environmental change in China, much more attention should be paid to issues of important environmental change that may have great impacts on the national security of China, to the scientific assessment of the vulnerabilities of the natural and social-economic system of China to the impacts of global environmental change, and to the active establishment of the national risk management system, in which global environmental change should be included, so as to make contribution to sustainable development and construction of harmonious society of China.

J	Lum, WH; Lane, M				Lum, Weng; Lane, Michael			EXAMINING CLIENT PERCEPTIONS OF PARTNERSHIP QUALITY AND ITS DIMENSIONS IN AN IT OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIP	AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING; DYSFUNCTIONAL CONFLICT; TRUST; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; DETERMINANTS; COMMITMENT; INNOVATION; ALLIANCES; BUSINESS	This paper reports on an empirical study of the multidimensionality of partnership quality in IT outsourcing arrangements and the relationships between these dimensions of partnership quality. A two-phase national survey was conducted to collect empirical data to confirm the dimensions of partnership quality in an IT outsourcing arrangement from the client organisation perspective and to identify the significant relationships between these dimensions using a second generation multivariate analysis techniquepartial least squares (PLS). The findings from results of the data analyses show that inter-organisational trust, shared business understanding and to a lesser extent, functional and dysfunctional conflict between the client organisation and the outsourcing vendor in an IT outsourcing relationship are the key determinants of partnership quality. The key outcome variable for high partnership quality between the client organisation and the outsourcing vendor in an IT outsourcing relationship is mutual beneficial sharing of risks and benefits. Commitment in an IT outsourcing relationship is confirmed as a multidimensional construct of behaviour commitment and temporal/ continuance commitment and was found to be influenced by the other dimensions of partnership quality. The key findings of this study provide support for the notion that Trust and shared business understanding are key drivers in the IT outsourcing partnership style relationship ensuring that the sharing of risks and benefits are realised and conflict is minimised leading to a high quality and ultimately successful partnership between the client organisation and the outsourcing vendor. Furthermore our findings indicate that behavioural commitment to the contractual obligations of an IT outsourcing relationship sustains an ongoing temporal commitment to the partnership between the client organisation and the outsourcing vendor.

The benefits of Communities of Practice have been described with respect to lecturers' qualifications and teaching competencies influencing students implicitly, as well as to areas related to the students themselves. Many studies have proved the fact that the process of learning is of a social character (e.g. Lave, Wenger, 1991). That is why Communities of Practice present a suitable environment for collaborative learning, which makes the processes of generating, sharing and storage of knowledge easier. The present paper defines the concept of Communities of Practice on a theoretical level and moreover, provides a brief overview of the latest research on Communities of Practice with regard to education. Another part of the article focuses on pre-research into the Communities of Practice at the Faculty of Economics and Management (FEM) of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CULS). Although the authors conform to the opinion that Communities of Practice are a natural feature and spontaneously develop wherever there is a need for sharing implicit or tacit knowledge, the pre-research focused on the verification of this premise in order to continue with research of a quantitative nature. The existence of the Communities of Practice was verified on the basis of fundamental characteristics following Wenger's model. Other characteristics considered significant in relation to Communities of Practice by McDermott were also investigated. Based on a group interview, the existence of Communities of Practice of the students at FEM of CULS was verified and a conceptual model created. The determined work prerequisites will be investigated in another phase of the research.

Our fragmented and underprepared health care system must rely on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) when a public health emergency occurs and surging patient populations overwhelm resources and reserves. While the SNS offers, a robust capability and logistical infrastructure, there are still concerns over the allocation of these resources when needed. As the health care system adjusts to economic and political influences, health care organizations are reexamining their investment in the market, and as facilities close and consolidate, health care resources become increasingly scarce. When needed, what ethical questions does the SNS force us to make? Can we make these decisions along a path of social justice and still turn away an emerging pandemic?

J	Morandi, V; Sgobbi, F				Morandi, Valentina; Sgobbi, Francesca			Learning in Networks of SMEs: A Case Study in the ICT Industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN CAPITAL AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESSIONALS			English	Article						ICT; Learning Process; Management Capabilities; Networks; SME		This paper contributes to the debate on the participation of SMEs in voluntary business networks by framing the relationship between the different types of network-based learning. Learning about networking, which concerns the capability to set, manage, and terminate a strategic alliance, is opposed to learning by networking, which involves the sharing and the joint creation of technical knowledge. The proposed framework is tested in the case of a network of Italian SMEs in the ICT sector. Empirical evidence confirms that learning about networking enables learning by networking and helps to balance those tensions and conflicts that inevitably mark the existence of inter-firm networks. Learning about alliance management provides networked IT entrepreneurs with the capabilities to compete against larger competitors. As learning paths also drive the evolution of inter-firm alliances, networked entrepreneurs would benefit from choosing collective goals in line with their alliance management capabilities.

J	Mullner, J				Muellner, Jakob			TAPPING THE LIABILITIES' SIDE - AUSTRIAN EVIDENCE FOR PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTOR INVOLVEMENT, GROWTH AND THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF FIRMS	ASIAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE			English	Article						private equity; investor involvement; ownership; internationalisation; strategic finance		This paper aims to close one of the most persistent gaps in international business (IB) and strategic management (SM) research by advocating a systematic extension of our research perspective to a more finance-based "liabilities' approach". As such, it responds to the recent work of prominent scholars such as Agmon (2006) and Bowe, Filatotchev and Marshall (2010). We challenge the prevailing "finance follows" mindset and - using Private Equity (PE) investors as an illustrative example - we demonstrate how an integrated approach may improve existing theories and open up entirely new avenues of research. We present confirmatory as well as exploratory findings on the impact of investors, suggesting that a company's ownership not only determines a company's financial strength but also has a number of less obvious implications for growth and internationalization. Our findings suggest that investors may be a strategic asset and can serve as catalysts for a company's growth at several levels of involvement.

J	Mutua, FN; Von Hagen, C; Kuria, D				Mutua, Felix N.; Von Hagen, Craig; Kuria, David			Cotton Mapping in Kenya: GPS-Based Data Collection - A Cost Comparison with High Resolution Satellite Imagery Mapping	INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT & APPLIED SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						GIS; GPS; Cotton; Spatial Analysis		The main objective of this study was to carry out farm size auditing (verification) and provide a baseline data for a strategic information management system for mapping cotton in Kenya. It aimed to establish an accurate, updated and detailed database for all the cotton farmers working with Rift valley Products Limited (RVP). This study demonstrates the use of Global Position System (GPS) data collection methods and Geographic information system (GIS) to provide accurate, key and important information for decision making and planning. GIS based spatial analysis was conducted and the best locations for harvest collection centres were determined, based on the shortest and least cost path of delivery by the farmer. The maps produced have proven to be critical tools for the field officers for route planning when conducting field visits. This has led to a considerable cut in the cost of production. A cost comparison between GPS field data collection and use of a high resolution satellite image is given, implying that field data collection is still the most cost effective method of collecting accurate information, especially if the land parcels under consideration are small and segregated.

J	Nelson, HJ				Nelson, H.			Visible IT in Credit Unions: Strategic Advantage and Disadvantage in Two Web Eras	INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Banking IS; Information Technology Adoption; IS Value; IT Investment Evaluation		Research indicates that rapidly evolving technology and markets do not provide a first mover strategic advantage but favor the second mover. This paper introduces a third variable: hype. In a time of rapid technology and market evolution, hype overrides the expected results and gives the first mover a strategic advantage. This study examines a homogeneous set of medium-sized information-dependent and information-intensive organizations as they implement visible information technology in two eras: during a time of intense hype and during a more normal time where technology has become commonplace. One hundred matched triples of credit unions were examined as they chose to remain offline, implement an informational website, or implement a transactional website during the highly hyped Internet expansion time of 1998 through 2002. One hundred matched pairs of credit unions were then examined during the more normal time from 2003 through 2007. Results indicate that credit unions that embraced the hyped technology gained significant strategic advantage. Second-moving credit unions that waited for the more mature technology survived, whereas the credit unions that did not adopt the technology were at a significant strategic disadvantage.

J	O'Regan, N; Ghobadian, A				O'Regan, Nicholas; Ghobadian, Abby			Rescuing a telecom giant from the jaws of bankruptcy A case study and an interview with Sir Richard Lapthorne, chairman of Cable & Wireless	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Turnarounds; Strategic management; Critical success factors; Senior management; Decision making		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate key strategic decisions involved in turning around a large multinational operating in a dynamic market. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on analysis of archival documents and a semi-structured interview with the chairman of the company credited with its rescue. Findings - Turnaround is complex and involves both planned and emergent strategies. The progress is non-linear requiring adjustment and change in direction of travel. Top management credibility and vision is critical to success. Rescue is only possible if the company has a strong cash generative business among its businesses. The speed of decision making, decisiveness and the ability to implement strategy are among the key ingredients of success. Originality/value - Turnaround is an under-researched area in strategy. This paper contributes to a better understanding in this important area and bridges the gap between theory and practice. It provides a practical view and demonstrates how a leading executive with significant expertise and successful turnaround track record deals with inherent dilemmas of turnaround.

J	Ozesenli, ON; Demirel, T				Ozesenli, Ozhan Nuri; Demirel, Tufan			A MULTI-STAGE SUPPLY CHAIN MODEL TO DETERMINE OPTIMAL DISTRIBUTION CENTER STRATEGY	SIGMA JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND NATURAL SCIENCES-SIGMA MUHENDISLIK VE FEN BILIMLERI DERGISI			Turkish	Article						Supply chain management; mixed integer programming; network design	DESIGN	Distribution center (DC) strategies are one of the most important strategic decisions in the optimization of supply chain networks (SCN). In this paper, a multi-stage, multi-period, multi-product SCN model, which includes procurement, production and distribution is developed. The main contribution of this study is to introduce a model, which enables to change the number, locations, scales and capacity levels of DCs to optimize total supply chain (SC) cost. The SCN is modeled as a mixed integer linear problem to satisfy estimated demand with minimum fixed and variable cost entities, which are subject to capacity of suppliers and production facilities with locations and scales of DCs. Suggested model is applied to SCN of a multinational Fast Moving Consumer Goods Company (FMCG) to examine the performance of the model in real world cases. Three different strategies for DCs are implemented and run under 36 different scenarios via an optimization package, Insight's SAILS (R), with real data. The performance of strategies under different scenarios is compared. It is found that "SML" approach performs better than other strategies under all scenarios.

J	Papageorgiou, E; de Bruyn, H				Papageorgiou, Elmarie; de Bruyn, Herman			Challenges of Executive Information Systems in listed Johannesburg Stock Exchange companies	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							EIS; SUPPORT; REQUIREMENTS; LESSONS; SUCCESS	Background: The widespread use of Executive Information Systems (EISs) as a management information tool was noted in listed Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) companies. The digital business environment exposed executives to so much data that data need to be converted into useful information that is organised and summarised. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to establish and to determine the existence, and to what extent EISs exist in all levels of management and to identify the challenges companies experienced in listed JSE companies. Therefore the problem exists that EIS-users at all levels of management are unaware of the challenges of EISs and that EISs can be used as a tool to analyse their businesses' performance and competitiveness. Method: A mixed method was used; both quantitative and qualitative in nature. Questionnaires were sent to 334 listed JSE companies and 13 interviews were conducted with users of EISs in all levels of management. Results: The results of the study demonstrate that the majority of respondents of the questionnaire have an EIS or plan to implement an EIS. The results further revealed the respondents' positive attitude towards EISs as it is an excellent management information tool that adds strategic value to their business, that is critical for real-time decision-making, solves problems and creates a competitive edge. From the results it is evident that there is a need for an EIS to be 'everybody's information system'. The results of the interviews demonstrate that an EIS is a seamless reliable system necessary for proper timeous decision-making. The respondents to the questionnaire and the interviewees indicated that they understood the value of EISs as a useful part of their company. Conclusion: The study adds value to the awareness and understanding of EISs that creates a business environment in which business and management can enhance sustainability and strategic competitiveness.

Towards a multi-input model, method and tool for early design phases in innovation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						early design phases; innovation process; potential technology concept model; PTC; C-K theory		This paper focuses on the early design phases of innovative projects. More precisely, the question of the innovation opportunities development and management is addressed here, starting from a theoretical model and methodology, until precise tool perspectives. The key elements of our approach are the potential technology concept (PTC) multi-input model and the C-K theory. Our PTC model is based on three dimensions (concept, technology and potential) and highlights the need of interactions between them regarding strategic and operational levels. Starting from the analysis of these three dimensions, different opportunities for the innovation are identified. In order to develop every identified opportunity, the three dimensions have to be explored with specific workshops and the C-K theory resulting in a tree diagram. The paper presents also tool perspectives dedicated to structure the preliminary exchanges among all stakeholders using criteria to consolidate new ideas. Two case studies are finally proposed.

In this reflective process, I make a single point: that the locution of race is limiting if it persists in being a point of struggle for marginalized scholars. In so doing, I distinguish between race as the site of intellectual engagement and race as a point from which to engage in scholarship. I begin with a brief explanation of how I came to take the decision to research three white women and of (dis) locating myself as other to the respondents. I then examine my actions in the context of concerns raised by other black scholars in their engagement with the academic establishment. Finally, I draw on the works of feminist scholars and argue that politicized and strategic understandings of otherness can potentially create challenging means for intellectual activism.

MECHANISM OF STRATEGIC COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES FOR MINING COMPANIES	JOURNAL OF MINING INSTITUTE			Russian	Article						strategic management; competitive advantages; competitiveness; specific assets; strategic assets; the institutional environment		Effective strategic management of mining companies is based on mechanisms of formation of the steady competitive advantage, realised by means of purposeful and co-ordinated strategy. The model of strategic management by competitiveness of the company is based on the resource concept, the theory of the value based management, the institutional theory, the theory of competitive advantages. Basic distinctions between the theory of positioning and the resource theory are shown. Importance of the account of the institutional restrictions creating artificial competitive advantages is proved. The approach to an estimation of efficiency of financially-investment strategy of the company is offered.	[Ponomarenko, T.

VALUATION OF MINERAL ASSETS OF A MINING COMPANY ON THE BASIS OF THE OPTION APPROACH	JOURNAL OF MINING INSTITUTE			Russian	Article						mineral assets; fair value; real option; real-options valuation (ROV); binomial model		Reliable estimation of assets valuations in mining companies play a significant role in ensuring capita] accessibility as well as correct current and future company valuation. Valuation of assets can be fulfilled either by a costs or by a fair (market) value, and also should be based on the value-based approach that represents management flexibility consideration. By valuation of a mining company's assets and also assets of corporate companies which have mineral assets, it is necessary to consider mineral resources as assets and reveal their systemic and specific features. Mineral resources as assets and mining industry itself have strongly pronounced option characteristics, which determines significance of the option approach's correct application and quantitative assessment of management flexibility. Application of the real options method improves the methodology of a mining company's valuation and strategic management tools by means of an adequate allowance for risk, ensuring of flexibility and strategic decision consistency, opportunities of fast switching over and continuity of changes.

S	Ray, JL; Smith, AD		Bergh, DD; Ketchen, DJ		Ray, Joshua L.; Smith, Anne D.			WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS: PHOTOGRAPHS AS A NOVEL METHODOLOGICAL TOOL IN STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT	BUILDING METHODOLOGICAL BRIDGES	Research Methodology in Strategy and Management		English	Article; Book Chapter						general review; photographs; photo-elicitation; qualitative methods	ANTECEDENTS; DESIGN	Purpose - The purpose of this chapter is to review and categorize how photographs have been used in management research and to provide strategic management researchers with suggestions about how to use photographs to enhance their qualitative research methodologies. Methodology/approach - We develop a typology of photographic uses in management research by reviewing several scholarly journals. Findings - We identify two dimensions that differentiate how photographs have been used in management journals. First, photographs can be used to illustrate scenes from a field setting or they can be interpreted as data. Second, the role of field participants can be one of active collaboration or no involvement in the photographic aspect of the qualitative research project. For instance, field subjects can collaborate in research by aiding in the photo-documentation process and/or aiding in the photo-elicitation process. Choosing which of our four identified photographic approaches represents a critical decision for qualitative researchers interested in incorporating photographs in their research. Practical implications - We suggest ideas for strategic management researchers related to use of photographs in their research. Also, we describe how specific strategic management research projects can be approached with photography, which we argue can lead to enhanced theoretical contributions. Originality/value of paper - To date, little has been written in the strategic management field about the use of photography. This chapter provides a succinct review of photographic methods in management research. Moreover, this chapter provides suggestions for how strategy researchers, study participants, and interested readers of management research could benefit from incorporating photographs into research accounts.

Jewish Family and Children's Services: A Pioneering Human Service Organization (1850-2008)	JOURNAL OF EVIDENCE-INFORMED SOCIAL WORK			English	Article						Organizational history; nonprofit organization; Jewish community		Jewish Family and Children's Services of San Francisco, the Peninsula, Marin, and Sonoma Counties is a pioneering nonprofit human service organization that has delivered services for 157 years. Over the course of its history, the organization has transformed itself from an all-volunteer agency delivering aid to immigrant families during the Gold Rush era to a $30 million nonprofit human service organization offering a full-range of services to adults, children, and families. The history of Jewish Family and Children's Services sheds light on the importance of strong leadership, strategic planning, external relationships, and strong donor support.

The results show that most rapidly growing firms in the region can be defined as small, knowledge-intensive business service (KIBS) providers. In order to create and commercialise innovation these firms use various innovation support services (most frequently technology-related and internationalisation-related services). The results also show that there is a concrete need for intermediary organisations that help small technology firms to choose appropriate innovation support services and generally act as external strategic partners during the commercialisation of innovation process. Providing convenient access to suitable 'brokers' may thus enhance the contributions innovation support services can make to the development of small, high-growth technology firms.

J	Slabbert, Y; Barker, R				Slabbert, Yolandi; Barker, Rachel			An integrated crisis communication framework for strategic crisis communication with the media: A case study on a financial services provider	COMMUNICATIO-SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL FOR COMMUNICATION THEORY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						Crisis communication; crisis management; excellence theory; integrated communication; stakeholder relationship building; strategic communication		In order for organisations to survive in an ever-changing milieu in the current business environment, sufficient crisis communication and management practices need to be in place. Despite this, organisational crises are often inefficiently managed, which could be ascribed to the lack of strategic management of crises (Kash & Darling 1998: 180). This article explores the lack of strategic crisis communication processes to ensure effective crisis communication with the media as stakeholder group. It is based on the premise that the media are one of the main influencers of public opinion ( Pollard & Hotho 2006: 725), thereby necessitating the need for the accurate distribution of information. Furthermore, the study focuses specifically on the financial industry, which is arguably more sensitive and thus more prone to media reporting because financial services providers manage people's money (Squier 2009). A strategic crisis communication process with the media is therefore proposed, facilitated through an integrated crisis communication framework, proposing a combination of integrated communication (IC) literature, with emphasis on Grunig's theory of communication excellence, to build sustainable media relationships through two-way communication; and a crisis communication process that has proactive, reactive and post-evaluative crisis communication stages, thereby moving away from seeing crisis communication as a predominantly reactive function.

J	Steynherg, RP; Veldsman, TH				Steynherg, Rina P.; Veldsman, Theo H.			A comprehensive, holistic people integration process for mergers and acquisitions	SA JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL MERGERS; HR MANAGERS	Orientation: Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As) are a frequent, alternative strategic growth option to organic growth for organisations. The failure rate of mergers and acquisitions is alarmingly high (70% plus failures). The people factor is seen as one of the main contributors to this failure. Research purpose: To develop and validate a comprehensive, holistic model for the people integration process during mergers and acquisitions. Motivation for the study: The literature on a comprehensive, holistic people integration process for mergers and acquisitions is sparse and fragmented Research design, approach and method: A qualitative approach was adopted consisting of a three step process which solicited the views of seasoned M&A Practioners; these views were compared against the available literature. Finally, practioners were asked to critique the final model from a practice perspective. The utility of the final model was assessed against two mergers and acquisitions case studies. Main findings: A comprehensive, holistic people integration process model for mergers and acquisitions was developed and validated. However, this model vill only significantly enhance mergers and acquisitions value realisation if it is applied from the appropriate vantage point. Practical/managerial implications: The proposed approach will increase the probability of a successful M&A people-wise and M&A value realisation. Contribution/value add: Theoretically, the development and validation of a M&A people process integration model; practimlly, guidelines for successful people integration; organisationally, significantly enhancing the chances of M&A success; and community wise, the reduction of the negative effects of M&A failure on communities.

In addition, pistachios exports need to recognize the internal and external factors that affect the trend of pistachio exports, and, furthermore, strategic planning is required. In this study, by using a measuring method, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats were identified in the form of a SWOT Table. To design the pistachio export development strategies for Kerman the presented strategies and the result of quantitative strategic planning matrix were considered, and market development strategies were introduced as the main and most beneficial strategies for pistachio. In addition, Kerman pistachio exports, for achieving success in global markets, should follow conservative strategies. Most of the conservative strategies including market development were determined by the position assessment matrix and strategic action (SPACE). [Hamid Taboli, Mehdi Yadollahi.

J	Takac, Z				Takac, Zoltan			STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT APPROACH OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF KANJIZA BETWEEN 2011-2020	DETUROPE-THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TOURISM			Hungarian	Article						regional health care; medical personnel; human resource development; financing problems; strategic development opportunities; action plan		There are several health care institutions in the municipality of Kanjiza: Health Centre of Kanjiza (1 medical station, 8 outpatients, 7 pharmacies), Special Hospital for Rehabilitation "Banja Kanjiza", and some private surgeries (10 private enterprises). These public health institutions have to fulfill the needs of 27,510 inhabitants in 13 settlements on an area of 400 km(2). The Central Health Found annually participates with 300 million dinars in financing health care services in the municipality. More than 70 well-educated medical workers ensure adequate quality and professional level of services. The municipality is characteristic of fragmented settlement system and policentric structure (Kanjiza - Horgos). Therefore public health system faces (material, human and quality) deficiencies in its sustainability. Health care institutions of the municipality collaborate with the surrounding secondary and tertiary institutions (hospitals). "Banja Kanjiza" is of strategic importance both from the aspect of health tourism and balneology, having traditionally good reputation. However its situtation is stagnant or even declining due to lack of investments. The financial report of health care institutions for the year 2009 indicates high level of indebtedness and budget deficit. The Health Centre of Kanjiza is in the first place in the region concerning high depreciation rate of fixed assets (68.99%). The same is true for the medical bath. These problems could be resolved over founder's legal practice with adequate budgetary background from the local government. However, transfers of the local budget in the municipality of Kanjiza are below both the state and provincial average (2.35%). Characteristics of socio-demographic and social medicine profile of the population are: Demographic ageing (the average age is 40-43-45, depending on villages), very high proportion of the population is older than 65, presence of vulnerable social groups (Romas (2.64% in two settlements: Horgos and Adorjan), smaller number of refugees)). Health care system should pay special attention to the following population groups: children (4,896), adults (17,154), people above 65 (4,704), women above 15 (11,613), expectant mothers (144). The vitality statistics of the population are unfavourable in regional comparison (decreasing number of inhabitants (8,560 people less between 1971-2008), negative natural population growth (-7.8%), low vitality index of the population (51.3), the life expectancy of men is the lowest in the region (67.69)). The most common diseases of adult population in Kanjiza are: diseases of the respiratory sytem (16.98%), diseases of the circulatory system (15.63%), diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (10.85%), diseases of the genitourinary system (10.15%), and injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes (7.86%). In 2008 the main causes of death in Kanjiza were diseases of the circulatory system in the first place (71%) followed by cancer or tumour (15%). Air and water pollution are in the first place among environmental damages. For developing health awareness of the population (hygiene, nutrition, physical activities, alcohol, smoking stc.) it is necessary to develop an action plan, in which preventive medical examinations play major role oriented towards vulnerable groups in partnership with local institutions (social, educational and civilian organisations). Human resources are the main quality factors of health care. The maximum number of medical personnel in the municipality is regulated by a ministry decree. The minister backs it up every year with a plan of the number of medical personnel in health care. Some empirical researches performed in 2008 proved the fact that while unemployment rate is the highest among medical workers with secondary education. In regional comparison even Vojvodina and North Backa are lagging behind the Serbian average concerning the number of specialists, pharmacists and dentists. The number of specialists is the lowest in Kanjiza: 0.81 physicians on 1,000 inhabitants (2.09 in Serbia, 1.63 in Vojvodina). For adequate human resources management it is necessary to provide active local planning, scholarship policy and participation of local government. After summarising situation analyses and empirical researches follows the SWOT analysis, in the final phase of strategic planning. We can formulate some characteristics: Strenghts: renovated buildings, trust, experience, natural resources (thermal water, mud), Weaknesses: human resources, hardly motivated workforce working in rural environment, high territorial fragmentation, Opportunities: competitive and well found specialists services, dental health services, health tourism, Threats: reforms, negative demographic trends, unemployment, emigration. Then comes the formulation of vision and mission statement. Vision: Providing good quality and developed health care for every inhabitant of the municipality of Kanjiza. Mission: good technological preparedness (medical, information technology), international standards, well-educated medical personnel, nice and pleasant atmosphere (energy efficiency, environmental protection), providing health services utilising natural resources (thermal water, mud), with special attention to social health position, needs and health awareness of the inhabitants and developing partnership between institutions. Strategic goal: developing integrated health care in the municipality of Kanjiza. The strategic goal contributes to improved health conditions of the population, cost efficiency, utilisation of complementary sources (EU, Vojvodina stc.), consumer satisfaction. Five programs dedicated to the realisation of the strategic goal are: infrastructural development of health care (1), improving energy efficiency (2), primary health care and prevention, partnership for health (3), continuous development and further training of medical personnel (4), implementation of integrated information system (5).

This paper analyses whether the implementation of manufacturing flexibility, as solution to the continuous changes of the environment, will encourage exploration of new knowledge and exploitation of a company's abilities. This relationship was measured in 231 production firms. The results obtained show that the firms develop exploration of new knowledge at the same time as they exploit their abilities. The results also show that some of the dimensions of manufacturing flexibility encourage the development of both exploration and exploitation. Finally, we find a moderator effect in these relationships if we take into account environmental dynamics.

J	Tarzijan, J				Tarzijan, Jorge			Limit pricing with complementary goods	JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Complements; Limit price; Signaling; Entry deterrence; Pricing; Markets		Purpose - This paper aims to examine the equilibrium limit price charged by a producer trying to deter the entry of a firm that can choose one of the two markets of complementary goods. Design/methodology/approach - The authors model a dynamic game of incomplete information solved using a "perfect Bayesian equilibrium" approach. Findings - It is shown that an incumbent will be willing to spend more resources - i.e. charge a lower limit price - to deter entry into its market as products become more complementary. This is because additional benefits are gained from entry deterrence by facing a more competitive market in the complementary product. The additional benefits of entry deterrence are shown to be a function of the degree of complementarity between goods. Practical implications - A managerial implication of this article is that firms are willing to compete more fiercely to send an entrant to the other's incumbent market as the degree of complementarity between goods increases. An interesting conclusion that is derived from the above analysis is that managers should invest to understand the interdependences (e.g. complementarities) of the goods they sell, since the strategic variables chosen to compete may be affected by them, in some cases in a non-trivial way. Social implications - From a public policy perspective, the main contribution of this paper is to point out that regulators who analyze predatory pricing, or other (probably) illegal "low-price strategies", should consider the degree of complementarity between goods and its effect on pricing. Originality/value - As far as the authors' knowledge goes, there are no other papers that analyze entry decisions involving multiple markets of complementary goods.

One cost and six quality goals, namely moisture and ash contents and thermal values of each of two biomass types, were selected. Four model scenarios were investigated: i) benchmark total cost and upper bounds of the mean values of the six biomass properties (Initial Goals), ii) relaxing the quality goals by 10% from the Initial Goals scenario, iii) relaxing the quality goals by 20% from the Initial Goals scenario, and iv) all goals as in Initial Goals except that the Atikokan Generating Station (AGS) is supplied with only unutilized or underutilized biomass. Varying degrees of increase in total costs as well as costs for each power plant compared to the benchmark costs were observed for the other scenarios. The highest increase in total cost (7.54%) was observed for the scenario in which the AGS plant uses only unutilized or underutilized biomass.

Determining Solution Space Characteristics for Real-Time Strategy Games and Characterizing Winning Strategies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER GAMES TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SELECTION; EXAMPLES	The underlying goal of a competing agent in a discrete real-time strategy (RTS) game is to defeat an adversary. Strategic agents or participants must define an a priori plan to maneuver their resources in order to destroy the adversary and the adversary's resources as well as secure physical regions of the environment. This a priori plan can be generated by leveraging collected historical knowledge about the environment. This knowledge is then employed in the generation of a classification model for real-time decision-making in the RTS domain. The best way to generate a classification model for a complex problem domain depends on the characteristics of the solution space. An experimental method to determine solution space (search landscape) characteristics is through analysis of historical algorithm performance for solving the specific problem. We select a deterministic search technique and a stochastic search method for a priori classification model generation. These approaches are designed, implemented, and tested for a specific complex RTS game, Bos Wars. Their performance allows us to draw various conclusions about applying a competing agent in complex search landscapes associated with RTS games.

J	Xodo, A				Xodo, Alberto			Gaining competitive advantage through a low carbon economy: China vs Europe	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Europe; China; Energy industry; Renewable energy; Forecasting; Competitive strategy; Carbon emissions; Energy sector		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the possible developments of the energy sector in 2050. Special consideration is given to the evolution of the relationship between Europe and China. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on the analysis of current trends and news to develop a hypothetical scenario for the energy sector in 2050. A new hypothetical scenario is proposed in which China's role is dramatically shifted from world's largest polluter to that of leader of the green revolution. Findings - The paper suggests that the countries with the highest standards could gain a competitive advantage by imposing their standards on the other countries. In the specific scenario analyzed in the paper, China is the country that will gain such an advantage by 2050. Research limitations/implications - The paper's main limitation is the lack of estimations on the likelihood of such a hypothetical scenario. Practical implications - Practical implications of the paper are the recommendations to European Governments and agencies to take their energy policies one step forward towards low carbon solutions. Originality/value - The new perspective taken by the paper puts China under a new light and uncovers long-term strategic implications of recent trends in the energy sector.

J	Gogan, JL; Rao, A				Gogan, Janis L.; Rao, Ashok			Barcodes, RFIDS, lemonade and conversation	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						RFID; innovation; new product development; entrepreneurship		Atul Mahajan nicknamed 'AM,' a wealthy Indian, sits on the board of Kisan Group, his family's chemical company (family and company names disguised). Charged with managing the Mahajan family wealth, he has formed a private equity group that helps build mid-market companies. He has also launched a few technology-enabled ventures of his own, including a company that failed in its attempts to sell a service that used encrypted and masked barcodes for document authentication and a successful company that provided administrative and data management support for pharmaceutical clinical trials. Now, apparently with sufficient resources to contemplate another entrepreneurial venture, AM wonders whether to revive the document authentication business, with a turnkey solution or one or more services that would use encrypted RFID tags instead of the older barcode technology. This teaching case was developed based on interviews with Mr. 'Mahajan' and two other employees. The case provides an opportunity for students to investigate technical, strategic and operational uncertainties and challenges associated with building a business around a new technology. For business schools that are attempting to 'globalize' their curriculum, the case offers the benefit of presenting the point of view of a well-connected Indian entrepreneur.

Technology management and strategy composition: innovation of IC foundry	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						IC foundry; IC designers; Evaluation criteria; MCDM; AHP; IC process strategy model	PRODUCT LIFE-CYCLE; DECISION-MAKING	The goals of this research are two-tiered: The first goal is to analyze the evaluation criteria used by integrated circuit (IC) designers when selecting foundry service providers. The second goal is to use an in-depth case study on the global IC foundry leader, TSMC, to explore the strategic compositions of IC foundry's process development, since the process technology has been found, through our survey at the prior stage, to be the most significant evaluation criterion in view of competitiveness in the customer market. As a result, for the foundry industry, technology no longer counts for everything, although it is a priority; coordinated strategies, in contrast, should assure more business merits for all concerned. This study has drawn the strategy matrix with eight categories of IC foundry process strategies.	[Lin, Grace T. R.; Yu, Hsiao Chen; Hsieh, Aaron Y.

J	Liu, HF; Ke, WL; Wei, KK; Gu, JB; Chen, HP				Liu, Hefu; Ke, Weiling; Wei, Kwok Kee; Gu, Jibao; Chen, Huaping			Adoption of Internet-enabled Supply Chain Integration: Institutional and Cultural Perspectives	PACIFIC ASIA JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Internet-enabled supply chain integration; Institutional pressures; Organizational culture; Upper echelons	ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; COMPETING VALUES; IMPACT; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; ANTECEDENTS; ORIENTATION; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK	Fostering supply chain integration (SCI) via Internet technologies has been widely regarded as a critical factor for firm success. Internet-enabled SCI may help enhance firms' capabilities in technology, product and market development, and thus allows firms to initiate or adapt to competitive changes in the market. Yet, the decision on Internet-enabled SCI is challenging due to the high uncertainties involved. Research on the antecedents of Internet-enabled SCI is of interest to both researchers and practitioners. Based on the view of upper echelons theory (UET), this research derives a syncretic model for firms' adoption of Internet-enabled SCI by presenting senior executives' cognitions as firms' perceived institutional pressures, and senior executives' values as firms' organizational culture. Results from a survey show that institutional pressures and a culture that values organic process have a strong impact on firms' inclination toward Internet-enabled SCI. In addition, we find that institutional pressures and organizational culture have interaction effects on Internet-enabled SCI.

J	Bernardo, JRRF; Campos, LAN				Ramos Ferreira Bernardo, Jose Raphael; Nascimento Campos Filho, Luiz Alberto			Mapping the academic research on mergers and acquisition	SISTEMAS & GESTAO			Portuguese	Article						Mapping; Academic Production; Mergers and Acquisitions		This paper examines the scientific production in the area of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) published in Brazil and abroad. The study period goes from 1984 to 2006, using eight international and six Brazilian periodicals, containing a total of 16,640 articles, 366 of them on mergers and acquisitions, of which 101 deal with the themes of synergy or financial performance of acquisitions. Following a similar methodology for national and international articles, we grouped the articles chosen by periodical, authors and number of authors per article. The findings show that the number of published articles on the theme increased over the study period, although with some fluctuations. Also, Lubatkin, Luo and Sing were the researchers with the largest number of articles published.

Leader tenure and the relationship between market growth strategy and church performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NONPROFIT AND VOLUNTARY SECTOR MARKETING			English	Article								Taking a strategic choice perspective, the current study examines leader tenure and the growth implications of pursuing a market penetration versus market development strategy in a church setting. Using cross-sectional time series regression analyses of 1415 church organizations over a period of 6 years, study findings demonstrate the influence of leader tenure on both financial and non-financial church performance, but provide minimal evidence supporting the argument that the selected market strategy matters to organizational performance outcomes in churches.

J	Juhary, J				Juhary, J.			The Challenges in Developing E-Content	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING			English	Article						content development; e-content; e-learning		Malaysia is considered an active key player in information communication technologies (ICTs) especially in education. In fact, in the National Higher Education Strategic Plan, one of the Critical Agenda Projects (CAPs) of the Minister of Higher Education is e-learning. It goes without saying that all higher learning providers in Malaysia must be prepared to provide state-of-the-art facilities for the students. One critical aspect of e-learning is the quality and quantity of the content, or what will be referred by many scholars as e-content. This paper attempts to identify the challenges of content development for e-learning practice at the National Defence University of Malaysia (NDUM). It is crucial to investigate this issue since the university just purchased its Learning Management System (LMS). It is expected that resistance will be present as the academics at the defence university is a mixture of junior and senior lecturers, as well as civilian and military lecturers; and some of these academics have been teaching without the assistance of e-learning. In so doing, the methodology of this paper will mainly be content analysis of various reports, governmental documents, as well as semi-structured interviews with lecturers at the NDUM. As this paper acts as a preliminary investigation into the issue of e-content at the university, only seven lecturers were interviewed. Initial findings suggest that there are basically five challenges of developing e-content at the NDUM. These include the lack of ICT and e-learning policy that can provide guidelines to academics; the uncertainty of ownership for e-learning initiatives; the lack of understanding of the roles of e-learning; the lack of awareness on e-learning; and the difficulties to develop military based content due to confidentiality issues. Two possible solutions for these challenges are also examined which take into consideration the urgent need to set up an e-Learning Unit and to provide series of workshops and seminars of teaching with technology, or relevant courses. It is found that in the effort to give students the exposure to and experience of e-learning, the first step in the implementation phase, which is to develop e-content, has alerted the university of the various fundamental challenges that need to be addressed accordingly.

NON-TAX PROFITS AS A MAIN SOURCE OF MUNICIPALITIES' DEVELOPMENT BUDGET	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						non-tax profits; development budget; strategic planning; strategic management; current expenses; co-financing		One of the ways out of the current economic recession is understanding the need for deliberate influence on the development of municipalities; searching methods to implement the mechanisms of strategic planning including the current situation; and setting aims and tasks that realize them. The author suggests using non-tax profits as a guaranteed source of a municipality's development budget. Changes to current budgetary laws are offered to spend non-tax profits on financing capital expenses. Thus, according to the current budgetary law municipalities will have a source of co-financing of territory development costs.										0	0	0	0	0	TOMSK STATE UNIV	TOMSK	LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA	1561-7793	1561-803X		TOMSK STATE UNIV J	Tomsk State Univ.

Strategy and organization are closely interlinked. If a firm's strategies can greatly influence the organizational structure, the organizational environment can also make certain business unit strategies very unlikely or sometimes totally impractical for the managers. Establishing close links between a firm's human resource, organizational design and strategy is therefore very crucial for a strategy to become successful. Managers in Islamic firms, on the other hand often fail to create excellent coordination between a firm's strategy and its functional departments, processes, systems and people. Where Islamic firms need to learn the art of converting their strategy into strategic action efficiently, it is also equally important to align their organizations with their strategies. This article is specifically aimed at providing some clear cut guidelines to the mangers of the firms operating in an Islamic environment as to how they can create an excellent coordination between different organizational units and once created, how they can use such a coordination for mobilizing each and every ounce of intelligence available to a firm and putting together all the intellectual resources of their employees for achievement of their strategic goals.

J	Buyuk, K				Buyuk, Koksal			A Study on Measurement of Organizational Culture as an Element of Strategic Performance Management	ESKISEHIR OSMANGAZI UNIVERSITESI IIBF DERGISI-ESKISEHIR OSMANGAZI UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES			Turkish	Article						Strategic performance management; organizational culture; strategy; balanced score-card; organizational commitment		Determining correct strategy for an organization and applying it with the help of organizational culture is a necessary and compulsory step to be taken in order to achieve long term success. It is necessary to develop organizational commitment in order to motivate current human resources for the sake of organizational aims in long term. It is vital to observe the development of organizational culture and manage that process in order to interpret contributions of employees to long term strategic aims. As a result of that kind of a situation, what kind of an organization culture is desired for achieving strategic aims can be explained to employees. Managing that process consciously will also add contributions for repairing gaps at organizational culture in accordance with the strategic aims. In this study, measuring organizational culture via Balanced Scorecard, which is one of the widely used tools of strategic performance management, is proposed. Because of the fact that organizational culture affects efficiency of internal processes directly, it is argued that it is more appropriate to evaluate under learning and growth dimensions of Balanced Scorecard.

In this situation, Customer Satisfaction Management(CSM) is emerging as a core business factor to create continuous growth without competitive exclusion because it is possible to churn management and draw an advocate customer. In this pa- per, with Suhyup mutuality bank as a sample for research, I have looked for necessary Customer Satisfaction(CS) factors and deduced a Customer Satisfaction Index(CSI), Customer Loyalty and Net Promoter Score(NPS) of detail factors in CS through a survey. Based on these result, the strategic factors required to improve CS were found and strategic directions for CS were proposed through a CS portfolio analysis.

This case describes how a CIO in such an organization met that challenge by focusing on actions rather than plans, and on bottom-up processes rather than top-down decisions. The CIO keyed on benefitting from employees' competencies. The organization, here called "NorConstruct," has few long-term IS strategic plans. Instead, it has developed five different IS strategic themes on a general level. It's actual IS strategy takes place through different IS projects. The case is told through the CIO and provides rich descriptions of IS strategic processes in NorConstruct, as well as the CIO's thoughts on the pros and cons. Throughout the case, several relevant reflections are described.

J	Kristianto, Y				Kristianto, Yohanes			Dynamic Price and Quantity Postponement Strategies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Game Theory; Managerial Flexibility; Market Share; Strategic Planning; Supply Chain Management	COMPETITION; CAPACITY; INVESTMENT	This paper studies duopolistic competition under dynamic price and production quantity postponement for two differentiable products, which share common components from one supplier at a certain degree of substitution. Both price and quantity postponement is benchmarked according to the Bertrand and Cournot Stackelberg game. In addition, system dynamic is applied to show the long term effect of both strategic decisions (price and production quantity) on profit and against demand uncertainty. The results show that price postponement is appropriate for high modular products (make-to-stock) and production quantity postponement for special orders (make-to-order). The final part of the paper concludes with results and outlines future research directions.

J	Zhao, F				Zhao, Fang			Taking a Strategic Alliance Approach to Enhance M-Commerce Development: Challenges and Strategies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						M-Commerce; Network Management; Strategic Alliances; Strategy; Wireless Technologies		Current m-commerce business models show that m-commerce depends on complex networks of business relationships, which often comprise telecommunications service providers, mobile device makers, banking industry, Internet search engine providers, and various third-party value-adding companies. Due to the nature of m-commerce, the key to success in m-commerce lies predominantly in managing a network of alliances. This paper answers research questions, such as why do companies team up for m-commerce? What are the key challenges facing the alliances? How can companies address the challenges? What does the future hold for the study of strategic alliances including m-commerce alliances? This paper extends strategic alliance theories to the study of m-commerce alliances that are formulated in various cultural and national backgrounds. The authors examine both strategic and operational strategies for m-commerce alliances and discuss a wide range of issues in the formulation and implementation of m-commerce alliance strategy	[Zhao, Fang] Amer Univ Sharjah, Management, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates		Zhao, F (corresponding author), Amer Univ Sharjah, Management, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.

However, the process of on-line optimization takes too much time and cost because it needs the significant contribution of process optimization specialists. To solve this problem, a web-based support system for on-line optimization is designed. The design specifications of the target product are identified using product design tools such as house of quality and roof correlation matrix. The design specifications are implemented into three product modules: communication module, project management module, and information interaction module. The final prototype system is evaluated based on a real application to the on-line optimization of a PTA process. The system shows both the time and the cost could be reduced by 43.5% and 43.3%.

J	Jankensgard, H				Jankensgard, Hakan			Measuring Corporate Liquidity Risk	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CORPORATE FINANCE			English	Article							DETERMINANTS; MANAGEMENT	This article presents the outline of a framework for evaluating liquidity risk (at the corporate level) with risk measures that are intuitive and economically relevant. In particular, the risk measures are designed explicitly to show the effectiveness of a company's risk management program in helping the firm to (1) avoid financial distress or default and (2) ensure its ability to undertake all strategic investments. For managers attempting to quantify liquidity risks, this paper proposes that the risk measures have two important features: One is to make the liquidity risk estimate depend on some measure of the firm's balance sheet strength, one that reflects the role of the balance sheet as a risk buffer. The second is to provide a useful estimate of the opportunity costs associated with a given liquidity shortage-one that reflects the value of the investment opportunities that liquidity problems could jeopardize. The author illustrates the application of the proposed risk measures with an example of a company evaluating a hedging strategy designed to accompany a substantial increase in its investment budget. Using the risk measures discussed in this paper, the author shows how to assess the effectiveness of a proposed hedge in terms of its expected ability to reduce costly cash shortfalls in scenarios in which the firm's debt capacity is also expected to be depleted.

As at 2009, we have a cumulative figure of 87,701 HIV cases and 15,317 AIDS cases. HIV/AIDS related death totalled 13,394 cases. The majority of cases have remained among the drug-using sub-population but, twenty years into its progression, the epidemic has now begun to reveal a diversion in its course that of increasing heterosexual transmission and, what is termed an increasing feminisation of the epidemic. That is, more people are becoming infected through heterosexual transmission and, increasingly, more women are now living with. HIV. The National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS for 2006-2010, focus on 6 strategies: strengthening leadership and advocacy, training and capacity enhancement, reducing HIV vulnerability injecting drug users and their partners, reducing HIV vulnerability of young people and children, reducing HIV vulnerability of marginalized and vulnerable populations and improving access to treatment, care and support. Activities include the co-ordination of outreach services provided by non-governmental organisations by providing technical and financial assistance in HIV/AIDS programs. Intensified HIV/AIDS and health education, promotion and media campaigns are continuously carried out in the country. HIV prevention program at drug rehabilitation centres and prisons was also initiated in 1988. Sex education and harm reduction program aims to reduce the high risk behavior between intravenous drug users, e.g., sharing contaminated needles, unprotected sex. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission program was launched in 1998 at all government antenatal clinics. HIV and STI management at primary health care level was started in 2000 in health clinics throughout the country. Anonymous voluntary HIV testing was implemented, and in certain states in the country, pre-marital HIV screening was carried out. The anti-retroviral treatment program was also scaled up. Due to all these education, prevention, treatment and rehabilitative programs, incidence of HIV has decreased over the past years but more efforts are needed to halt HIV, malaria and other infectious diseases by year 2015 in the country.

LTD	ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT CASES			English	Article						Critical management studies; bureaucracy; power; Human Resource Management; symbolic interactionalism; scientific management		Affluent Advertising establishes a Human Resource (HR) department in response to increasing external competition and internal turnover. The department's prerogative, however, is primarily limited to the espousal of administrative discipline and communication of top managements' decisions to employees, after anchoring them in rhetoric of management knowledge and organizational efficiency. An early and unexpected failure of this department raises several questions regarding its need and significance as well as its future in the organization. At a more broad level, the case highlights the use or abuse of HR department as a tool for reinforcing systems of dominance and legitimizing the self-interested decisions of top management and firm owners. In doing so, it not only challenges the unitarist theories of management that treat workplace as an integrated and harmonious entity, wherein employees and employers share common interests, but also contests the self-alleged neutrality, objectivity and impartiality of mainstream management practices by bringing to light its dark, biased and (value and) power-laden aspects. It thus sheds light on the real agenda behind the HRM development, and elucidates how the recommendations (structural, strategic, cultural and procedural) forwarded by so-called impartial HR departments are actually embedded with patterns of organizational power distribution. Lastly, the case also elaborates how various structural arrangements, traditionally known for their effectiveness (that is, Matrix and Product Team configurations), can adversely impact work environment, if employed without need, for bureaucratic purposes solely.										0	0	0	0	0	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INDIA  PVT LTD	NEW DELHI	B-1-I-1 MOHAN CO-OPERATIVE INDUSTRIAL AREA, MATHURA RD, POST BAG NO 7, NEW DELHI 110 044, INDIA	0972-8201	0973-0621		ASIAN J MANAG CASES	Asian J.

J	Tazhimamat, TS				Tazhimamat, Shabolotov T.			THE IMPACT OF MIGRATION ON DEMOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE OF THE POPULATION AND SITUATION IN RUSSIA AND KYRGYZSTAN	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						migration; labour markets; labour force; demographics; Russia; Kyrgyzstan		For Russia, the current labour migration has become of strategic importance. In addition to factors such as poverty and unemployment in their countries of origin, the magnitude of labour migration in Russia is linked with the state of its workforce. For example, in 2005 from 35-40 millions of working-age women in Russia only 10-15 millions were formally employed to work outside home; remaining women are the mothers who are on leave for child care, officially registered as unemployed or not engaged in formal employment activities for other reasons. If we talk about the male population, from 25-30 million of able-bodied men of about 0,8-1,0 million were in prison, about 5 millions were alcoholics and drug addicts, approximately 3-4 million people are currently serving in the military, law enforcement, security. There are only about 8-10 million men employed in manufacturing, management, finance, health, education and culture. Over the past 15 years, Russia has lost each year in work force due to 1 million excess of deaths over births. Thus, the country while picking up the pace of economic development is facing a serious shortage of manpower. Annual growth of labor productivity in Russia's economy by 5% GDP growth may provide only 40% by 2010. In this case, the number of employees should be increased by 60% up to 103, 5 million people. This figure exceeds even the most favourable variant of the potential population of working age, which is about 24,3 million. UN projections indicate that in 2010, it seems to be justified to receive 2 million migrants a year. If we talk about the impact of migration on the demographic situation in Kyrgyzstan, it may be noted that there is a complex demographic situation in the country as a result of migration processes, characterized by slowing down the population increase rate, which is currently provided only through a higher birth rate among the rural population. In general, relatively high levels of reproduction characterize the population of the republic. These basic demographic indicators differ for urban and rural populations and vary depending on the region. The country itself, especially the southern regions, is characterized by agrarian overpopulation with simultaneous increase in the number of unemployed.

THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF A KNOWLEDGE-BASED PERFORMANCE MANAGEMET SYSTEM	GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS			English	Article						analytical hierarchy process (AHP); expert system; GAP analysis; knowledge-based (KB); performance management system (PMS)		Designing a Performance Management System (PMS) is an integral part of management control systems. This paper presents a hybrid framework for the design of a PMS for the Indonesian context, and the tailor-made design is expected to overcome the shortcomings of earlier models. The present hybrid PMS model seeks to improve the earlier research models using the following novel approaches: (1) implementation of a Knowledge-Based (KB) expert system, (2) Gauging Absences of Prerequisite (GAP) analysis, and (3) Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology in an integrated KBPMS. The paper shows that the present hybrid (KBAHP-GAP) approach to developing a PMS model is a realistic methodology. The combination of the KB-AHP-GAP approach allows detailed benchmarking of the PMS existing in an Indonesian company. Furthermore, this approach can assist in identifying and prioritising the key decisions that need to be executed to overcome the existing PMS shortcomings. symbiotic strategic alliances. Conversely, affiliate firms prefer competitive strategic alliances with competitors when they are not dependent on the parent firm.

Based on a company's position, mission, values and vision, strategic planning defines a trajectory, as well as the requirements for the company's organizational and management processes. Often, there is a gap between the highest hierarchical level and the operational levels with respect to the implementation of strategies. Based upon a literature review, this paper proposes a model that integrates the production processes to the strategic management levels. This model is implemented as a Strategic Manufacturing Management System (SMMS), which establishes a coherent set of strategic management processes for the manufacture function. SMMS is fundamentally structured as a multileveled Balanced Scorecard (BSC) that creates rationalities to plan, implement and control strategies. The decision-making, communication and learning processes are carried out by means of the strategic management system. The management system is monitored and evolves according to a selected set of measurements that gives the final form to the strategic management system. The SMMS was tested in an electro-electronic appliances company and the results from the first year since its implementation are presented. The proposed model is guided by the BSC architecture, but it also uses specific techniques, procedures and tools that were customized for the company at issue. The final result is a guiding framework for the integration, design, implementation and management of a manufacturing strategy.	[Borges de Menezes, Oswaldo A.

The innovation process utilises market innovations to establish a competitive advantage, gathers intellectual assets, attains proprietary rights and fosters the ability to implement appropriate strategies and sustain a competitive advantage, thus generating premium value. The entrepreneur's commitment uncovers market opportunities and exploits the inventiveness of value-system technologies to result in market innovation. The integration of the above-mentioned four forces with changing market needs transforms the capabilities of the value system to allow it to sustain business value regeneration and thus generate premium value. The failure of either one or all four forces of entrepreneurs' innovative strategies will lead to a reduction in the market value of the products and disintegrate the industry value system. This phenomena was observed in the gem and jewellery industry in Sri Lanka, where the industry has been capable enough to develop a competitive product base but has been positioned to experience a reduction in market value. This reduction has resulted in the disintegration of the industry value system, forcing firms to work in isolation	[Ekanayake, Shyamalie; Abeysinghe, Dhammika] Univ Kelaniya, Dept Ind Management, Kelaniya, Sri Lanka		Ekanayake, S (corresponding author), Univ Kelaniya, Dept Ind Management, Kelaniya, Sri Lanka.	sekanayake@dialogsl.net					[Anonymous], 2005, GEM EXP AN; [Anonymous], 2009, MAGNIFICENT JEWELS N; [Anonymous], 2007, EXP STAT GLANC; Brush CG, 2008, BUS HORIZONS, V51, P21, DOI 10.1016/j.bushor.2007.09.001; Cameron G, 2005, EUR ECON REV, V49, P775, DOI 10.1016/S0014-2921(03)00070-9; Central Bank of Sri Lamka, 2007, 2007 ANN REP; Central Bank of Sri Lanka, 2006, 2006 ANN REP; Dharmaratne P.

Different contexts of Intranet, as well as introduction, development stages, performance and Intranet content are presented. Three approaches are in existence: corporate Intranet, specialized Intranet and HR Intranet. These can be linked to different stages of development: communication, functional support, and knowledge management. The HR Function will be successful if it integrates Intranet in its management process, if the players are aware of the stakes and they behave as "real change agents". Research shows the importance of strategic alignment between human resource management (HRM) and Intranet as well as the relevance of technological infusion, therefore, this paper's result in showing a configurative approach that allows the integration of more variables and in turn leads to a systemic model contains great significance.

J	Koch, BJ				Koch, Bradley J.			No Strategy is an Island to Itself: China First-Mover and Other FDI Strategies' Interaction Effects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASIAN BUSINESS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						China; First-Mover Advantage; Foreign Investment; Joint-Ventures; Strategic Decisions	INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES; EARLY-MOVER ADVANTAGES; PERFORMANCE; ENTRY; MARKET; GUANXI; ORDER; FIRMS; EXPANSION; NETWORKS	The first-mover strategy for foreign investment is examined to determine under what conditions a significant effect exists when it is combined with other foreign investment strategies like partner selection, geographical market focus, joint-venture control, and resource commitment strategies. Using official audited data and survey data from Sichuan, the results reveal that there are significant interaction effects. The interaction effects can eliminate first-mover advantage, create a first-mover effect that previously didn't exist, or change the direction of the effect. Consequently, the author argues that it is better to analyze strategies as a set that is formed by a series of strategic decisions made by managers as they establish foreign joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries.

The referral-marketing practices of travel agencies: an exploratory study of word-of-mouth communication in the travel-agency industry in the Western Cape	COMMUNICARE-JOURNAL FOR COMMUNICATION SCIENCES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article								Organisations can make use of high levels of customer-service delivery to stimulate positive word-of-mouth referrals. Referral marketing is primarily applied by organisations when the budget is the marketers' largest limitation. The purpose of the article is to indicate the current status of the relationships that travel agencies in the Western Cape Province have with their referral market, and to provide recommendations to the management of travel agencies in said province regarding the improved application of the principles of relationship marketing to this market. The target population for this study comprised 118 travel agencies of which 61 managers and/or owners participated through personal interviews in the completion of questionnaires. Data analysis was done by calculating averages and standard deviations, explorative factor analysis, Cronbach Alpha-values and practical significance by means of effect sizes. The findings stipulate that the owners and managers of travel agencies must create and establish more closely integrated relationships with strategic suppliers to increase the value offering of their products and services to customers, whereby the travel agencies can ensure that the needs and wants of customers can be satisfied more successfully, which, in the long run, could lead to positive word-of-mouth referrals.

The history of its exploitation in the sharply competitive Brazilian market has been marked by various crises which made the exploitation of LPG an activity that has been subject to a number of uncertainties. The product is in the production chain of different market segments and is an important component in the national energy matrix. As a result of this, the process of classifying consumers by LPG distributors is a strategic task and subject to a set of criteria that need to be observed. In this context, this article concentrates on multi-criteria modeling in order to resolve the problematic of classifying clients in a LPG distribution company. A model is proposed based on the ELECTRE TRI method and the aim is to allocate the portfolio of clients to a set of ranked classes.

Richard			Strategic positioning analysis of Ghana's national wood export sector	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Export; Ghana; wood products; international market		Export-led strategies are very crucial to achieving growth and goals of developing and transition economies such as Ghana. As a result, export strategies are being adopted in many developing countries. Although such export strategies might be in place, the deployment of public resources and funds warrant periodic programmatic evaluation. The objective of the study was to assess Ghana's wood products export sector strategies and performance. Using a combined National Export Strategy Template (NEST) and Balanced Scorecard (BCS) framework, we surveyed the 250 largest wood products manufacturers in Ghana. Overall, respondents indicated there was no comprehensive and well documented export strategy in place. We suggest that public and private sector institutions in the wood export sector coordinate activities to create an enabling environment for Ghana wood products exporters to compete favorably in the international market. The application of a combined National Export Strategy Template (NEST) and Balanced Scorecard (BCS) framework can be used to evaluate wood product export strategies in any geographical or national setting. This approach is a valuable tool that pinpoints strategic strengths and weaknesses.	[Domson, M. S. Odoom] Forestry Commiss Pavil, Trade Fair Ctr, Accra, Ghana; [Vlosky, P.

J	Ilshat, AT				Ilshat, Tazhitdinov A.			LOCAL GOVERNMENT REFORM: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						local government; municipal formation; level of authority; budgetary security; local budget; efficiency estimation; development strategy		In the article the basic problems and ways of further development of local government in the Russian Federation are considered: optimisation of volume of powers at the municipal level and their financial and economic maintenance; planning, management and realisation of achievement of strategic targets of developing the municipalities; estimations of productivity and monitoring of efficiency of activity of local governments. The changes are considered in structure and maintenance of questions of local importance executed within the limits of local powers and problems, connected with execution of the transferred state powers. The attention is paid to the problem of mutual delegation of power between a municipal area and settlements from the position of the two-level model of local government. Specific proposals on optimisation of distribution of powers in granting municipal services are made. The dynamics of change of the mechanism of financial maintenance of local powers when solving questions of local importance during the local government reform (2003-2010) is presented. The most important measures in the areas of budgetary process perfection, profitable base strengthening, and expenses optimisation are offered. As a complex tool uniting all the actions to increase the social and economic development of municipal union, approaches to solve the problems are offered: 1) Strategic planning defining prospects of municipal development, equation of priorities and rates of development with financial resources of municipal formations; 2) Strategic management forming the mechanism of strategy realisation - a control system of actions of the power, business and population to solve the strategic and tactical problems of municipality; 3) Monitoring allowing to operatively provide bodies of municipal authority with full and adequate information to control strategy realisation and to make effective administrative decisions at each level of management. The problem of estimation of local governments activity efficiency is considered from the positions of the legal acts regulating the given process; definitions of the diagnostic indicators characterising the activity of local governments; techniques of estimation and automating the process of estimation of local governments activity efficiency.

An analysis of the existing transaction data provides the information on students that will allow the definition of the key processes that have to be adapted in order to enhance the efficiency of studying. To understand better the problem of dropouts, the data are processed by the application of data mining methods: logistic regression, decision trees and neural networks. The models are built according to the SEMMA methodology and then compared to select the one which best predicts the student dropout. This paper concentrates primarily to the application of the data mining method in area of higher education, in which such methods have not been applied yet. In addition, a model, useful for strategic planning of additional mechanisms to improve the efficiency of studying, is also suggested.

Supplier network optimization not only plays a key role to find cooperative network, but also increases more competencies across supply network. However, traditional supplier optimization for choosing direct suppliers no longer meet the requirements of strategic supplier network. There exists a link between supplier network and supplier selection. Thus, in order to satisfy the requirements of different evaluation criteria and business decision, this study proposes strategic supplier network for supplier selection. In-depth combined pattern mining is considered first to find the first-level or direct strategic suppliers. Then extend the whole supplier network, with the help of value network, graph theory and evaluation criteria, the strategic supplier network satisfied the needs of supply network is generated. After that, by using strategic supplier network, companies can select the most suitable suppliers.

J	Yevgeniya, VK				Yevgeniya, Kudryavtseva, V			REAL ESTATE AS A STRATEGIC RESOURCE OF A COMPANY: INFLUENCE ON THE CORE BUSINESS	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						real estate; life cycle; value; costs; risks		The objective of this article is to identify the role of real estate in the core business of a company by investigating the impact of such parameters as added value, costs, and risks during the object life cycle. Many national and foreign researchers have studied the problem. The main definition of real estate, including the description of the object life cycle framework, are represented in works of A.V. Goremykin, I. I. Mazur et al., A.N. Asaul, O.S. Belokrylova, N.F. Vetcher et al. The problem of real estate risk identification, the specificity of real estate costs, and value added to the firm have been studied by V.V. Ivanov, M.G Viering et al., F. Hoffman, A. Lindholm et al., A. Pfnuer. Real estate costs (onetime, fixed, modernizing) are subject to change during the life cycle. The point is that the volume of expenditures increases with each cycle stage while their optimisation potential significantly falls. Being a company's asset and essential cost dimension, real estate adds value to the firm. It can be measurable (cost optimisation, increase of working efficiency) or intangible (image, competitive advantages). The intangible value is difficult to quantify, so, in practice, real estate is rarely regarded as a strategic company's resource. During the object life cycle the company has to face various real property asset risks, which consequently impact on expenditure volume and added value. So, such specific real estate risks affecting the firm require their proper identification and management. Presented indicators (added value, costs, and risks) and their impact during the real estate life cycle provide insight into the role of real property assets in the core business of a company.

Taking over to a proactive role in the innovation management is a fundamental step to achieve the strategic goals and it must be faced as a necessary condition for the formation of a favorable environment to disseminate knowledge to the Brazilian industrial sector. This work is based on two approaches: the technological innovation is a cumulative process - which is established by means of the interaction among government, enterprises and R&D institutions, besides the market and the technological foresight approach, in which the strategic management of the technological innovation implies negotiating demands and promising investigation fields, besides influencing on conditions of the environment in which the actors are inserted, promoting a macro-coordination. This paper presents considerations about the Brazilian aerospace industry and about the technological innovation context at the Defense Ministry and at the Aeronautic Command, specifically at DCTA.

J	Grotenhuis, FDJ				Grotenhuis, Frits D. J.			Successful Partnerships: A Matter of Experience?	SOUTH EAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						experience; integration; learning; mergers; partnerships; success		Statistics indicate that most mergers and acquisitions are not very successful. At the same time, similar reasons for success and failure have been reported over the past decades by different scholars. Frequent mentioned reasons are related to financial or legal issues during the pre-merger phase and cultural or integration issues during the post-merger phase. This far, hardly any study examined the learning effect of previous mergers and acquisitions experiences. This paper focuses on the post-merger integration phase of mergers and acquisitions, and the learning elements. First results indicate that managers can learn from previous experiences and thus increase changes for success of partnerships. Future studies could further explore 'best practices' of how to organize and facilitate the learning process of mergers and acquisitions. Further, concerning managerial experiences, it would be interesting to discern between more general lessons, and context-specific lessons of mergers as well as of other kinds of strategic partnerships.

A model for presenting strategies for the urban environmental management: A case study of Tabriz	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Pollution; strategy; city; environment; model; management; QSPM	HIERARCHY PROCESS; CITIES; EFFICIENT	Population growth, the destruction and pollution of the environment and lack of an effective management system are the grave problems that the major cities of our country are facing in present. The present situation, if continued, will cause irreparable damage and create serious disorder in the major cities, including Tabriz. The aim of this paper was to present strategies to improve the present state of the urban environment of the cities in Iran. To do this, the mission statement, the prospect and long-term objectives of environment management of Tabriz as the area under study are explained in details. In order to identify the main external and internal factors influencing the quality of environment management of the city, matrices for the External Factor Evaluation (EFE) and Internal Factor Evaluation (IFE) are devised. The strategy for the promotion of the present state of environmental management is obtained with completion of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SOWT). Matrices to determine the degree of attractiveness of these strategies, their respective Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrices (QSPM) are devised. To devise the matrices and determine the mission statement, prospect and long-term objectives of the Tabriz environmental management the Delphi method, questionnaires and interview are used. The Kolmogorov-Smimov test was used to determine the normal distribution of the data. The variance analysis and the comparison of the degree of attractiveness of the strategies showed that the higher quantity of the degree of attractiveness of a strategy does not imply its significance and priority over the others. To reach an answer for this need, a model has been proposed to determine and introduce the high priority strategies (QSPM). Using this model, high priority strategies to promote the present state of the environment of Tabriz were determined. The model for the development and prioritization of the urban environmental strategies proposed in this paper can serve as good example to determining the priority of the strategies for the urban environmental management, and the authorities and managers of other cities and organizations with wide range of activities can follow this model to evaluate and prioritize the strategies of their organization.

J	Rozhanovskaya, NK				Rozhanovskaya, Nina K.			NUCLEAR POLICIES OF THE USA AND THE USSR IN 1945-1954	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						nuclear policy; atomic monopoly; cold war; USA; USSR		The period from 1945 till 1954 is a key stage in the U.S. and Soviet nuclear policy formation process during the Cold War. Scientific aspects of the two superpowers' atomic projects are relatively well studied. However, it is also necessary to link the issue of scientific breakthrough with those of foreign policy and military strategy in order to fill the gaps in the existing research. Similar nuclear-policy issues were at the heart of U. S. and Soviet decision-making process in 1945-1954, namely: the use of atomic weapons as a diplomatic instrument; the role of atomic weapons in new military strategies; presentation of one's own and adversary's nuclear achievements to the public; establishment of an atomic industry management system. It is often assumed that the influence of scientists upon policy-making was more significant in the USA than in the USSR. However, it remains an open question. Another question is when new military strategies were formed taking into account nuclear weapons existence. It seems that such strategic review did not take place in the Soviet Union until 1960s. Minimizing the significance of the new technology in official rhetoric, the Soviet leadership did its best to catch up with the USA in the race for atomic weapons, while the USA struggled to benefit from its atomic monopoly, which it considered a "wasting asset". If the Rational Actor model is applied to the USA-USSR interaction, then differences in political regimes do not matter much. What matters is the set of actions and reactions within the limits provided by the international environment. If political regimes and internal state dynamics are also taken into account, then personal characteristics of major decision-makers ought to be given special attention to. The best way to link domestic and foreign policy processes is to rely upon Robert Putnam's two-level game model, which underlines the need of decision-makers to take into account the domestic feedback when making a foreign-policy move. Though many American and Soviet researchers have already studied U. S.-Soviet interaction in 1945-1954, including its atomic component, there are still gaps to be filled. Those gaps are, for instance, due to the lack of open sources on Soviet foreign policy. It is necessary to study the problem from a different angle, trying to link together the issues of scientific development, foreign policy, and military strategy. This research would benefit from new opportunities, such as declassified documents of the Soviet atomic project and U. S. foreign policy archives published online. The need to study the period of 1945-1954 is justified by the fact that all major stereotypes and perceptions of adversary's intentions were formed then, as well as decision-making mechanisms in the nuclear area. Besides, current U. S.-Russian strategic dialogue should be studied in the context, which includes the evolution of both states' nuclear strategies since the earliest years of bipolar confrontation.

PERFECTION OF MUNICIPAL FINANCES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						local self-management; the budget; financial independence		Local government based on the consideration of the population vital interests and active citizens' participation in the management process should become the basis of Russian statehood. The basic document of the recent reform is Federal Law. 131, accepted in October 2003 "On the principles of organization of local government in the Russian Federation". According to the Constitution of the Russian Federation it has established the general legal, territorial and economic principles of the local government organisation, defined the state guarantees of its realisation. But the main problem of local government's activity support - its financial base - is still unsolved. In the article the authors offer to change the present system of taxes splitting to the system, where each tax is rigidly attributed to the levels of the budgetary system, thus to aspire full autonomy of the authorities of different levels in establishing the size, structure and financing of certain kinds of expenses (according to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, Article 72). In our opinion, local budgets should be formed by the following taxes: the personal income tax, the tax to the maintenance of housing and objects of welfare sphere (the previously cancelled tax), the sales tax (the previously cancelled tax), the cumulative income tax, the real estate tax (combined land and property taxes). The suggested model of interbudgetary relations is reconstructed to self-support municipal formations. The attraction of finances of higher budgets is required only in case of tax potential insufficiency in subordinated territories for the objective reasons. It is impossible to provide the development of a territory and its economy without creating a stable and powerful tax base for the municipality. We offer to apply the Basic Score Card system in order to improve making administrative decisions both of strategic and operative character. The application of the mentioned recommendations will provide the equation of the financial resources generated with the help of taxes with the expanses, thus creating conditions for satisfaction of municipal formations needs, and, hence, to full realisation of their economic interests.

SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article								A bank, acting as a central planner under aggregate full certainty, optimizes liquidity allocation by sharing risk between discrete number of depositors. This paper demonstrates the following. (a) It is sufficient to rule out a bank run if all depositors inform the bank their types, patient or impatient, in advance, in a noncommittal manner. There cannot be a bank run because depositors' strategic behaviour induces the bank to act as a central planner under aggregate full certainty. (b) The impossibility of a bank run is consistent with the price mechanism in partial equilibrium; but it may be inconsistent with the price mechanism in general disequilibrium. (c) The paper concludes that the management of risk sharing by banks is not a cause for bank runs.

INVESTING IN EUROPEAN MARKET REAL PROPERTY THROUGH REITs	SLOVAK JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Real Estate Funds; Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs); Legislation; Pan-European REITs; Slovak Real Estate Fund (SREF)		For institutional and private investors, investing in real estate represents an attractive form of the consignment of their money. Real estate provides a regular source of income in the form of the rent from or interest on the credit provided. At the same time, real estate is a good investment instrument, because it provides diversified contributions and security against inflation for investors. In their efforts to diversify risk, investors are expressing growing interest in investing in the whole European Union. The success of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the U.S. also opened the door for investing in this market for small investors, which is the reason for the development of this type of investment company in the European arena. One problem concerning the development of European real estate investment funds is the unsolved issue of the harmonization of the legislation and regulatory safety measures, which would enable the creation of a common market for new investment products in Europe.

J	Delponte, I; Tomasoni, L				Delponte, Ilaria; Tomasoni, Lorenza			Transports and Energy: Urban Strategies for Planning	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			Italian	Article								The fight against climate changing pushed the States of the European Union to adopt new, strong and efficient objectives to protect the environment and improve life condition in urban centers. Particular attention is paid to the reduction of CO 2 emissions in order to promote a more livable environment and sustainable urban development. This growing communitarian policy and vision represents a suitable context for the introduction of innovative urban planning and managing practices allowing an attentive exploitation of natural resources. The principle of sustainable and durable development and the new concept of "energy planning" take to a revision of existent tools (PRG-Piano Regolatore Generale, PUM-Piano Urbano della Mobilita, etc.) used by Italian Public Administrations to plan and manage urban spaces and to the introduction of new ones (PEC-Piano Energetico Comunale, etc.). From this modern point of view, the field of transport and mobility covers a strategic role for two main reasons. The first is the relevant contribution of transports to the production of CO2 emissions (transports are responsible of the 30 - 40% of CO2 emissions in urban centers) and other toxic matters (PM10, NOx etc.); the second one is the strong impact that the effectiveness of public transports can have on citizens' quality of life and the reduction of private cars' use. Taking into account the wide range of fields, activities and services whose efficiency and sustainability depends on that one of the urban mobility system, a great number of actions can be proposed. The effective problem is the complexity of their mutual interaction in order to satisfy urban exigencies and respect existing regulatory indications. The analysis of alternative actions, technologies and scenarios that Local Administration can suppose to apply and/ or realize might result very interesting taking into consideration also the recent communitarian policy of "20-20-20" aiming to reach a reduction of 20% in greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption to come from renewable resources and primary energy use. It turns out to be necessary a revision of existing management and planning tools in the field of mobility and the engagement of new methodologies (monitoring indicators, campaign for citizens' involvement, dynamic and temporal use of infrastructures, etc.) and technologies (biofuels, electric vehicles, etc.) to support Local Administration during a transitional moment in which long and short-term development plans are strongly questioned. The more interesting strategic tool recently introduced into LA land planning practices is the "Action Plan". Starting from the identification of environmental, social and economical weaknesses and treats of the urban system the "Action Plan" tries to individuate critical situations and propose, as a kind of agenda, times and modalities of LA actions. Being strongly involved in these items, the city of Genoa turns to be a meaningful case study.

JOURNAL OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE			English	Article								What kinds of companies have successful cost and profitability systems? The authors surveyed companies from all over the world to find out. The results show that significant investments in time and money are required, but companies that succeed see significant benefits from their cost systems and share some common traits. They have a culture that encourages employees not only to understand their costs and profits, but also to act on the information. These companies often use activity-based costing and use their systems for operational, financial, and strategic decision support. They can also determine cost and profitability at all appropriate levels-for activities, products, customers, and departments. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

MECHANISM OF TOURIST RESOURCES INVENTORY DEVELOPMENT: ORGANISATIONAL SPECIFICITY	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						tourist resources; inventory of tourist resources; organisational mechanism		International experience shows that successful development of the tourist complex of the country and the expansion of tourist services export demand realisation of an active policy in the field of tourist resources systematisation. The organisation of this process is a difficult theoretical and practical problem, which has not been solved yet in Russian conditions. As the organisational mechanism of tourist resources inventory development does not have a universal character, there is a necessity of revealing its features with reference to Russia. The main requirements for the implementation of these relationships between the participants of organisational mechanism are: 1. Exclusion of duplication of certain actions by individual actors in the development of tourist resources inventory. 2. Free exchange of information that will enhance the speed of tourist resources inventory development and provide an independent crosscheck of the actions of all participants. 3. Involvement of the widest possible range of people in the process of inventory development, helping to identify the potential of individual tourist resources and to create a unique offer of tourist resources. 4. An interdisciplinary approach to the development of tourist resources inventories using the experience and knowledge in such areas as geography, economics, cultural studies, marketing and PR, history, land management, etc. The organisational mechanism of tourist resources inventory development should be considered as a management tool providing regulations of relations between the basic participants of the economic process. One of the major roles in this process belongs to the state customer, whose basic function consists in specification and coordination of the work results with enforcement authorities of the Russian Federation subjects and other interested persons. The organisational mechanism of tourist resources inventory development integrates all persons interested in the development of the tourist industry, and also provides their effective interaction at various stages of the process of inventory development. Mechanism realisation is expedient for carrying it out within the target programmes, and also during realisation of territorial strategic development.

A model for dynamic strategic planning based on a pragmatic utilization of the multitude of strategy models was used in a small university-affiliated research unit. Working with the strategic planning was well received by the staff, and the research managers gained a good basis for decisions about the future. Key inferences can be drawn from the involvement of staff in strategic planning in a professional organization: 1) the strategic concepts used must be adapted to the specific situation and the specific institution on a continuous basis so the staff accepts the necessity and meaningfulness of strategic planning; 2) the creativity of academic staff members is best expressed throughout the process by repeated written re-formulations of the vision, strategy and action plan of the institution; 3) strategic planning is most meaningful for those who are involved in it, but only the most interested staff members should be involved in the most time-consuming part of the process; and 4) the lemniscatic development method used can help to engage the staff in strategic planning, increasing the legitimacy of the strategy determined for the organization.

J	Adhikari, DR; Hirasawa, K				Adhikari, Dev Raj; Hirasawa, Katsuhiko			Emerging scenarios of Japanese corporate management	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						Corporate strategy; Strategic management; Japan		Purpose - The paper aims to: examine the evolution of Japanese corporate management (JCM); review the Japanese vs American corporate management model; discuss typical corporate strategy of Japanese companies; and evaluate emerging scenarios of JCM. Design/methodology/approach - The paper mainly reviews past and current literature to discuss emerging scenarios of JCM. Findings - Driven by persistent pressures from environmental forces in the postwar period, there have been changes in the way of managing ideas, things and people in Japanese corporations in order to cope in the world of competition. Research limitations/implications - The paper is mainly theoretical and no empirical evidences are presented to explore the situation of JCM in practice. Practical implications - With growing competition in the domestic and international markets in the recent past, Japanese firms have tried to achieve a new level of industrialization and a rapid technological advancement; they have faced an erosion of traditional values, a growing labor shortage and an ever-increasing complexity in size and operation. Therefore, this paper is mainly useful to academicians and professional to know about how JCM practices have been changing. Originality/value - Very few Japanese researchers attempted to write about emerging Japanese management scenario of the prewar period. The paper contributes by exploring different facts about prewar and emerging scenarios of JCM and adds value in this perspective.

Through a historical etymology we realize that the main generator of globalization process has been the scientific and cultural movement of renaissance and enlightenment times and In the present paper using the qualitative study approach, a historical-analytical investigation, through literature review method along with a survey of experts and specialists by using Focus Group Discussion (FGD) tool, we have tried to track the formation process of the World Trade Organization (WTO) as an economic pseudo-paradigm in the heart of universal paradigm of globalization. Based on this analysis, WTO is the natural and inevitable product of the universal globalization consequently, the industrial revolution and the advent of machine time which have laid the ground for the development of communication and information technologies. Finally, mentioned process provided appropriate context for globalization paradigm initiation. The heavily competitive atmosphere which under the shadow of universal globalization paradigm ruled social, political and economic realms of the world has been a reason for world wars and structural alterations which, in economics field, have necessitated the emergence of such international organizations as WTO. The economic, social and political changes of a period from 1920s until 1990s, which in turn are made due to the globalization paradigm, in general have laid grounds for the emergence of the World Trade Organization. Thus, as far as the globalization paradigm continues its existence, so does WTO as a natural obligation and consequence for the management of market economy system. The former GAT and WTO during their lifetime have had important influences on the development of trade and the process of resources distribution among countries of the world and simultaneously in order to realize its developmental goals in economics and people's life quality have been effective to and acceptable extent. In any case, private entities and organizations as well as governments and nations (especially underdeveloped and developing countries) must recognize the dominance of the new situations even for the sake of their own existence and survival and organize their internal solution whether in terms of legislation and law or of economic and strategies in such way as to take advantage of the new situations as an opportunity. In case of non-intelligent non-strategic treatment, these situations may turn into a devastating threat which brings eventual mortality to the productive and commercial infrastructures of Countries and organizations.

The role of the Atlantic corridor project as a form of strategic community of practice in facilitating business transformations in Latin America	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Globalization; Knowledge management; Leadership; Trust; Organizational change; South America		Purpose - This paper aims to summarise the scope, methodology and main findings of a doctoral thesis about business transformation in Latin America taken from a project management (PM) and communities of practice (CoP) perspective. Design/methodology/approach - The project adopted a case study approach in which the candidate was a consultant, embedded as a member of the business transformation entity. Data were gathered using public and private documentation, unstructured interview data, and observation and were validated through review of evidence with participants. Findings - The concept of the strategic CoP is supported as a useful means to help facilitate trust and commitment as well as knowledge sharing and how this facilitated greater understanding trust and commitment building mechanisms through effective leadership. The trigger to allow willingness of former rivals to cooperate through this entity is acknowledged as being a set of external pressures in the Latin American region coupled with deregulation at the regional level. This provided the necessary stimulus and the mechanism for effective business transformation is the strategic CoP. Practical implications - This model could be more broadly useful and suggest that it could be adapted to other geopolitical contexts. The research project also has implications as opening up a program and PM perspective on business transformation. Originality/value - There has been little focus on business transformation from a joint PM and CoP perspective so this thesis provides a useful vanguard research project.

This text addresses the topic of performance management, a continuous process of identifying, measuring and developing the performance of individuals and teams and aligning performance with the strategic goals of Romanian Federation Sport for all It is no longer a secret for anyone that one of the most difficult challenges managers face in contemporary organizations is performance management. Within activities specific to sports for all, nowadays, the evaluation of sport instructor-managers is not accomplished on the basis of specific criteria, as the case of trainer - managers involved in performance sport. Our purpose is to elaborate evaluation criteria for sport instructor-managers so that their evaluation is made according to performance management, by commeasuring and comparing results, by the physical-intellectual potential, professional and managerial potential, according to the objectives and requirements of the position held, therefore being eliminated the subjectivism and hazard of evaluation.

J	de Oliveira, CMB; da Rocha, EMP				Batista de Oliveira, Cassia Morato; Pinto da Rocha, Elisa Maria			Strategic Skills in Hospital Organizations Comparative Study in the Environment of Health Care Networks	REVISTA GESTAO & TECNOLOGIA-JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY			Portuguese	Article						Strategic Skills; knowledge management; Networking; Hospital Organizations		The article aims to investigate the presence of activities and management practices generating and diffusing knowledge in the context of hospital organizations, trying to infer whether there is a relationship between network performance and skill development strategies. According to Leonard-Barton (1998), these activities constitute the basis for the development of strategic skills. The work, of an exploratory nature, involved literature, documentary and field survey on two groups of hospitals in the Metropolitan Area of Belo Horizonte. One group acted networked to central regulation, and the other did not deploy a regulatory network. The results indicate the presence of activities generating and diffusing knowledge in both groups. However, the networked group had a higher presence rate of these activities, suggesting, then, that working in networks tends to favor the development of strategic skills in hospitals.

J	Benmoussa, R				Benmoussa, R.			MANAGEMENT OF PERFORMANCE PROCESSES: THE FLEXIBILITY CONCEPT	POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						flexibility; performance; strategy deployment; action plan; performance indicator; process; activity		In this paper, we draw the thinking context for production process piloting according to flexibility approach. We apply a transversal process that defines the strategic purposes and deploys them on business processes and activities to define at the end action levers that permit reaching the fixed strategic targets. Flexibility concept is deployed through this process. We propose in this way concepts as volume, delay and variety flexibility at strategic level and concepts as unavailability, effectiveness, flow, product, process flexibility at business level. The definition of action plan leads us to introduce the concept of flexibility-type and determine correspondent performance indicators. Our work focuses mainly on delay flexibility.

J	Botha, E				Botha, Elsamari			Perceptions of South African practitioners on the structuring and tasks of marketing and communication managers within organisations	COMMUNICATIO-SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL FOR COMMUNICATION THEORY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						Communication management; marketing management; organisational structure; South Africa; strategic communication; strategic marketing		The structuring of marketing and communication management within key organisations in South Africa is changing. These changes are affecting the relationship between marketing and communication practitioners, as well as the key tasks they are responsible for within the organisation. Globally, companies are downsizing, restructuring and eliminating hierarchy. This article investigates how key South African companies have responded to these changes, by looking at how the marketing and communication functions are structured within the organisation. Marketing and communication managers from top South African companies were interviewed telephonically. Findings from the study indicate that the two functions are progressively moving towards an integrated approach. However, a commonly agreed organisational structure is still not pervasive. Each organisation structured the marketing and communication functions differently, and various perspectives existed on the key tasks of both marketing and communication managers. From these findings, it is evident that the relationship between marketing and communication, as well as the role and tasks of marketing and communication managers, is still very diverse in the South African context.

The main challenge facing the international community at present is laconically described in the Report as "managing diversity". The term "investing" reflects the economic and administrative focus of the paper on governmental and public agencies' active interference into the development of sociocultural processes; while intercultural interaction is announced to be the essential and indispensable component of the contemporary social management. In terms of the proposals involved the management of cultural diversity amid the global crisis is actually set equal to anti-crisis strategies.	[Bunina, V.

Towards systemic sustainable performance of TBI care systems: emergency leadership frontiers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE			English	Article						Collaborative networks; Emergency medical leadership; Traumatic brain injuries; Performance; Systemic sustainability		Background Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) continue as a twenty-first century subterranean and almost invisible scourge internationally. TBI care systems provide a safety net for survival, recovery, and reintegration into social communities from this scourge, particularly in Canada, the European Union, and the USA. Aims This paper examines the underlying issues of systemic performance and sustainability of TBI care systems, in the light of decreasing care resources and increasing demands for services. Methods This paper reviews the extant literature on TBI care systems, systems reengineering, and emergency leadership literature. Results This paper presents a seven care layer paradigm, which forms the essence of systemic performance in the care of patients with TBIs. It also identifies five key strategic drivers that hold promise for the future systemic sustainability of TBI care systems. Conclusions Transformational leadership and engagement from the international emergency medical community is the key to generating positive change. The sustainability/performance care framework is relevant and pertinent for consideration internationally and in the context of other emergency medical populations.	[Caro, Denis H.

J	Chan, HK				Chan, Hing Kai			A Process Re-engineering Framework for Reverse Logistics based on a Case Study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Process reengineering; Reverse logistics; Learner-centred; Framework		Reverse logistics has gained increasing attention in recent years as a channel for companies to achieve operational excellence. The process involves manipulation of returned materials, or even products, which forms a pivotal role in sustainable development throughout the whole supply chains. To make reverse logistics possible, process re-engineering may need to be carried out. However, the processes involved in reengineering are practically complicated. Objectives, benefits, and applicability of any process re-engineering require a careful and detailed strategic planning. This paper aims to propose an easy-to-follow step-by-step framework for practitioners to perform process re-engineering, to learn and identify the critical issues in each step, and to be successful in applying process re-engineering in order to enhance reverse logistics performance. A learner-centred approach is adopted based on a case study of process re-engineering, which is demonstrated in the paper for explanation.

This paper focuses on the franchise network formation process and highlights social capital activation in a large multi-unit organisation. The success story of the rapid franchising network formation by a retail bank contributes to our understanding of rent generation and appropriation from social capital. The study describes how to leverage intangible assets to achieve strategic goals.

J	Dawson, P; Spedding, T				Dawson, Patrick; Spedding, Trevor			SIMULATION MODELLING AND STRATEGIC CHANGE: CREATING THE SUSTAINABLE ENTERPRISE	AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								This paper highlights the benefits of using discrete event simulation models for developing change management frameworks which facilitate productivity and environmental improvements in order to create a sustainable enterprise. There is an increasing need for organisations to be more socially and environmentally responsible, however these objectives cannot be realised in isolation of the strategic, operations and business objectives of the enterprise. Discrete Event Simulation models facilitate a multidimensional approach to enterprise modelling which can integrate operations and strategic considerations with environmental and social issues. Moreover these models can provide a dynamic roadmap for implementing a change strategy for realising the optimal conditions for operational and environmental performance. It is important to note that the nature of change is itself dynamic and that simulation models are capable of characterising the dynamics of the change process. The paper argues that incorporating social and environmental challenges into a strategic business model for an enterprise can result in improved profits and long term viability and that a multidimensional simulation approach can support decision making throughout the change process to more effectively achieve these goals.

REVISTA GESTAO & TECNOLOGIA-JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY			Portuguese	Article						Knowledge Management; Information Management; Knowledge Protection; Information Protection; Technological Base Companies		The main objective of this article is to analyze how technology-based companies manage and protect their information and their strategic knowledge. To achieve that goal, essential concepts were used such as data, information, knowledge, management and protection of information and knowledge. A case study was carried out with three technology-based companies. A questionnaire was elaborated which was answered by people directly linked to the information and organizational knowledge processes of the companies researched. The results revealed that the companies did not have any structured process to manage or protect their information and knowledge, though all companies had a clear conscience of the importance of working with such issues. It could be concluded that the investigated companies still have a long way to go in order to structure the processes to manage and protect their information and knowledge.

J	Decker, R; Dagasan, A				Decker, Reinhold; Dagasan, Abdullah			Improving strategic planning processes by means of cross-company collaboration along the value chain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategic planning; value chain; performance management; genetic algorithm; collaboration		The necessity of continuously improving managerial planning processes to support cost reduction ambitions is a constant topic in dynamic business environments. Against this background we explore the importance of collaboration in strategic planning processes. Starting from the relevant literature we develop a quantitative approach which is used to demonstrate the benefits achieved through collaboration by means of computer-based simulation. The results suggest that economic benefits can be realised by softening inter-firm boundaries regarding the strategic planning processes and collaborating along the value chain.

This makes managament of intangibile resources one of the basic challenges in modern managament that ensures optimal use of this valuable strategic resource as well as building success based on knowledge. After consideration and theoretical reflection of competitive advantage from the perspective of non-material resources, and highlighting the organizational knowledge as a fundamental intangible resource for the achievement of business success, its features and problems related to its management, the main purpose of this paper is primarily to present analysis of knowledge management practices in Serbian companies. Analysis of knowledge management practices in Serbian companies pointed out the weak development of knowledge management in the Serbian organizations. This work attemps to answer questions regarding very important issues of knowledge management, such what is the cause of poor development of knowledge management practices in Serbian companies and how to improve it.

J	Hayball, NP				Hayball, N. P.			Climate variability and water-sharing plans: Transferability of Australian approaches to Vietnam	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						climate change; IWRM tools; water-sharing plans		Water reforms in Australia have been comparatively progressive, including the agreement to the National Water Initiative (2004) and the implementation of over 130 water-sharing plans. Most of these plans include processes for dealing with climate variability, but only a few incorporate processes for addressing potential climate change impacts. Approaches include the use of scenario planning to better understand water availability and use; rules for prioritising water use; and setting aside reserve allocations. Vietnam, on the other hand, has had the legislative mandate since 1999 to develop water-sharing plans but has yet to do so. Recent reforms have led to the preparation of the National Target Program for a Sustainable Water Sector (NTPSWS): the national strategic plan for water resource management. The approval of the NTPSWS by the Vietnamese Government may provide the right incentive to gather resources to commence planning. The approaches used in Australia for addressing climate variability and potential climate change impacts would be transferable in the Vietnam context. Success, however, is probably dependent on strengthening institutional arrangements of the Vietnam water sector that includes increasing awareness of the benefits of water-sharing planning for sustainable water resource management at both the agency and community levels.

POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Local Strategic Networks; Small and Midsize Enterprises; Value Continuum; Software Industry; Partial Least Squares-Analysis	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT; SUCCESS FACTORS; INDICATORS; KNOWLEDGE; INDUSTRY; MODEL; CAPABILITIES; COVARIANCE	This paper explores the long-term partnership benefits of local strategic alliances in the software industry. A structural model of the value continuum is formulated and tested on data from small and midsize enterprises in Germany. Partial Least Squares Analysis is used to investigate the effect-casual-relations between foundation values, i.e. efficiency and effectiveness, and the innovation value. The results of our empirical study show that the innovation value of localized inter-firm networks originates from costs savings and quality improvements. On the contrary, alliance-induced 'speed ', measured by an acceleration of the R&D process, improved flexibility and/or shortened delivery time, has no significant impact on the market-based performance. Time-related benefits of alliances stated in literature may be important to maintain competitive parity, but they do support competitive advantage, market development and market penetration. Instead, value is created, among others, via exchange of tacit knowledge and reduction of transaction costs, particularly by a reduction of customer service costs.

J	Kim, YJ				Kim, Young Jun			A design of case-based decision making method by ES in educational business model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Business modeling; case-based reasoning; decision making; education; management information system		A case-based reasoning has emerged as an alternative to rule-based techniques for the expert system design. This paper describes an application of case-based reasoning method to the expert system design for decision making. With user's requirements, the system searches a domain dependent case-base for a similar case. If there is one, the system uses it to strategic decision making with minimum user's interaction. When there is no similar case, the system uses cases in domain independent case-base to make a new strategic decision making. The strategies for retrieving the relevant cases, for building a rough solution, for repairing the rough solution, and for learning cases are also described. It is also shown how the system works by using an example in designing for management applications. The major contribution of this paper is educational business model of an expert system with case-based reasoning approach to decision making. Since many strategic decision making experts use their old experiences in various cases, this study can lead to more realistic solution for such expert system in business applications.

An integrative and strategic approach to developing a graduate programme in Technology Management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTINUING ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND LIFE-LONG LEARNING			English	Article						education; programme development; vision-driven approach; technology management		This paper reports on the development of a graduate programme in Technology Management - a part-time, distant education programme developed for professionals with technical education and expertise. The paper focuses on a vision-driven approach used to develop the programme purpose and objectives. Analysing the core values and competencies of the educational institution ('Marist College') - benchmarked against institutions currently offering such programmes - and defining specific industry needs through direct input from a technology industry advisory board, degree completion students and consultants allowed an integrative, interdisciplinary and strategic approach to develop knowledge, skill and abilities objectives. These objectives were taken as the base for the actual curriculum development. This approach fostered the development of a programme aligned with industry needs and the competitive environment of the educational institution. Hence, it serves as a methodology for programme and curriculum development for graduate Technology Management education appropriate for public and private sector organisations.

J	Mancktelow, M				Mancktelow, M.			Community Health Clinicians Prepare for an E-Health Future	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article						change management; e-health; communication technology; lean thinking; mobile technologies; project management		With an increasing focus on e-Health, mobile technologies play a significant role in enabling information management at the point of care, which was integral to a new health precinct and associated models of care. This health precinct was being built in a northern suburb of Brisbane in Queensland, Australia. In 2006, an Information Management Project was established under the governance of a formal project management methodology. The objective of the Information Management Project was to identify and deliver innovative and sustainable Information Communication Technologies (ICT) solutions, such as introducing mobile technologies, and to pave the way to an e-Health future for community health clinicians. Stakeholder consultation was an integral part of the project involving clinicians, administrative, technical, and management staff. During the planning phase of the project this consultation was essential to embed an implementation approach that was owned by the business. A range of service delivery processes were identified for evaluation. Lean thinking tools were used to compare the end-to-end path for these processes using the traditional models and the mobile technology model. Early results have seen a saving in clinical and administrative time in being able to respond immediately to the clients needs at the time of service. This project focused on a business integrated approach as technology alone would not deliver a sustainable solution. There are still a number of challenges to be addressed before broader implementation, particularly the need to review policies to achieve a more equitable alignment between strategic and operational requirements.

J	Mohammady, P; Bolhari, A; Rajabi, M				Mohammady, Peyman; Bolhari, Alireza; Rajabi, Mohsen			The Application of Fuzzy Analysis on Modeling Behavioral Constructs; Appraisal of Informal Learning and Psychological Empowerment among Employees	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE-JMCS			English	Article						fuzzy expert system; fuzzy hypothesis analysis; individual development; informal learning; psychological empowerment		In the current ever-changing business world, organizations need to emphasize on employees as key element of acquiring competitive advantage. As managerial strategy, psychological empowerment has been less in consideration. In this context, authors investigated effects of informal learning on psychological empowerment. Both mentioned variables have been formed in individual context and led to organizational results in collective context. The contribution of this paper is the application of fuzzy logic on construct of appraisement model in better explaining of employee's behavior. It considers two important aspects of dynamic environment of organizations; first, uncertain environment of organizations and second, complexity of human behaviors which are ill-defined. The proposed model can be led to a better strategic planning of organization's social capital and can be applied to other contexts and would guide organizations to realistic appraisement of environmental factors. Authors have applied the proposed fuzzy-model in "Agricultural Jahad" organization and results are discussed.

J	Munro, CR				Munro, Carolin Rekar			Charting Workplace Transitioning Pathways of Generation - Y Human Resources Practitioners	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CAREER DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								The purpose of this paper is to present results from a study exploring experiences of Generation-Y Human Resources practitioners as they transition from academia to the workplace. Research findings are from on-line surveys, and individual and focus group interviews with 221 college graduates, 170 supervisors of these workforce entrants, and 42 educators. Emergent from data analysis is a prevailing disconnect between new recruit expectations and organizational realities. Revealed is a need for a more streamlined transition to move new recruits into the workforce in the following areas: assigned workload, strategic accountabilities, establishing internal networks, office politics, mentoring, and conflict management. Proposed is a template for fostering academic-business partnerships that capitalize on learning for and from the workplace to ensure premier experiences are delivered to steer new recruits into the HR profession. This enables new recruits to excel in their career aspirations; and gives business leaders the edge in creating work environments that appeal to the new wave of HR practitioners, hence improving ability to recruit and retain them in a shrinking labour market. With a high premium placed on transition management new recruits enter the workforce with a full complement of competencies to advance and perpetuate organizational prosperity. Ultimately, due diligence is exercised in preparing the next generation of knowledge workers under whose leadership global communities will thrive.

J	Nielsen, AP				Nielsen, Anders Paarup			Developing an organisational capability: dimensions, situations and managerial challenges	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						RBV; resource-based view; organisational capabilities; capability analysis; capability development; knowledge-based view of the firm	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; KNOWLEDGE ASSETS; INNOVATION; TECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTS; EXTENSION	Within the Resource-Based View (RBV) there is a lack of concrete methods by which the resources of the firm can be described, analysed and managed. This paper will present a number of simple tools that can assist the firm in analysing its stock of resources and capabilities. An organisational capability is modelled as composed of three different types of knowledge-based resources. The paper then describes a method by which an organisational capability can be described and modelled. Finally, the paper addresses managerial challenges for the development of an organisational capability based on the need for changes in the knowledge-based resources.

J	O'Regan, N; Ghobadian, A				O'Regan, Nicholas; Ghobadian, Abby			Creating a world class business through a merger of two equals An interview with Paul Walsh, Chief Executive Officer of Diageo plc	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Acquisitions and mergers; Strategic alliances; Corporate social responsibility; Strategic management		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore, from a practical point-of-view, a number of key strategic issues that critically influence organisations' competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a semi-structured interview with Mr Paul Walsh, CEO of Diageo. Diageo is a highly successful company and Mr Walsh has played a central role in making Diageo the number one branded drink company in the world. Findings - The paper discusses the key attributes of successful merger, lessons from a complex cross boarder acquisition, rationale for strategic alliance with competitors, distinctive resources, and the role of corporate social responsibility. Research limitations/implications - It is not too often that management scholars have the opportunity to discuss with the CEOs of large multinationals the rational of key strategic decisions. In this paper these issues are explored from the perspective of a CEO of a large and successful company. The lessons, while not generalisable, offer unique insights to students of management and management researchers. Originality/value - The paper offers a bridge between theory and practice. It demonstrates that from Diageo's perspective the distinctive capabilities are intangible. It also offers insight into how to successfully execute strategic decision. In terms of originality it offers a view from the top, which is often missing from strategy research.

Prospects for Bandit Solutions in Sensor Management	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						multi-armed bandits with covariates; sensor management; action-selection; dynamic environment	MULTIARMED BANDIT; ALLOCATION	Sensor management in information-rich and dynamic environments can be posed as a sequential action selection problem with side information. To study such problems we employ the dynamic multi-armed bandit with covariates framework. In this generalization of the multi-armed bandit, the expected rewards are time-varying linear functions of the covariate vector. The learning goal is to associate the covariate with the optimal action at each instance, essentially learning to partition the covariate space adaptively. Applications of sensor management are frequently in environments in which the precise nature of the dynamics is unknown. In such settings, the sensor manager tracks the evolving environment by observing only the covariates and the consequences of the selected actions. This creates difficulties not encountered in static problems, and changes the exploitation-exploration dilemma. We study the relationship between the different factors of the problem and provide interesting insights. The impact of the environment dynamics on the action selection problem is influenced by the covariate dimensionality. We present the surprising result that strategies that perform very little or no exploration perform surprisingly well in dynamic environments.

Growth among technology service firms: insights from the balanced scorecard	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICES TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						balanced scorecard; technology service		This research explores the relationship between the balanced scorecard framework and revenue growth among small, technology service firms. Consulting engineers alone are an important part of any economy, generating about 250 billion US dollars annually in worldwide GDP. Moreover, they represent about 17% of the total workforce. They fight for survival in a dynamic and turbulent environment where the critical strategic resource is an individual's ability to manage the convergence of rapidly evolving technologies. Two separate surveys of enterprises ranked by the Zweig Letter Hot Firm List, emphasising growth among US architecture, engineering and environmental consulting firms were conducted. The focus was on those smaller firms that changed classification upward based on gross revenue. Results highlight not only the advantages of pursuing a balanced approach to growth but also the importance of client intimacy as a key to generating wealth in knowledge-driven, innovative societies.

This paper proposes an analytical framework for the air traffic control system based on a system-of-systems paradigm, with a hierarchy of nested and cascaded feedback control loops-one or more for each type of control service. The framework is then used to assess the stability and response to random variables, such as poor weather and equipment failures. The performance of each control loop is then described qualitatively and validates the framework for investigating the benefit of new policies and technologies.

The urgency of the given direction is motivated, which comes from ideas of the competence approach requiring essential changes in educational activity, as well as from the analysis of innovations experience of modern educational institutions. The need of new strategic control of knowledge of people in educational sphere is shown, including development of new educational programs and their control The construction of the hypothesis of the scientific research on the topic is presented, the tasks and methodology of the research are given. In the article the approach appears within the methodology of humanitarian control and educational innovations studies to the notion of an educational program as a way to organize the activity of its participants. The research is based on the material of the program 'Institute of Innovations in Education' of Tomsk State University (the material was based on the reconstructions of innovation experience). The hypothesis is formulated about the condition of efficiency of the development and realization of educational programs. The control of development and realization of an educational program is efficient if participants of the program can influence the specification of the purpose, the content, the estimation of the program; possess various ways of technological enhancement of educational activity, including reconstruction of educational situations, teaching classes, making projects of educational activity organisation with the use of technology; use technological enhancement in educational activity for the development of modules for the PC programs.

Using the US Environmental Protection Agency's capacity, management, operations, and maintenance program (CMOM) as a guide, the water division of the Orange County Utilities Department in Orlando, Fla., developed a performance management plan to address the challenges of a rapidly growing Population and stretched water resources. Originally developed for wastewater utilities, CMOM addresses all aspects of the Orange County Utilities organization, with specific focuses on water utility management and operations, financial considerations, water treatment maintenance issues, public health protection, regulatory compliance, and safety. The Water CMOM program showed the gaps in the utility's organization, provided a method to prioritize and implement gap closure projects, and aligned the final recommendations of the assessment with the utility's goals and mission statement. The program created a repeatable process that can measure how the utility is performing, re-analyze the utility periodically, show gaps in performance, develop plans to close those gaps, and remeasure the utility using performance indicators and industry-accepted metrics-ML	[Walch, Marc P.; Immanni, Rishi] PBS&J, Orlando, FL 32810 USA; [Garrison, Seth W.] CDM Firms Cambridge, Cambridge, MA USA; [Torbert, Jacqueline] Orange Cty Util Dept, Orlando, FL USA		Walch, MP (corresponding author), PBS&J, 482 S Keller Rd, Orlando, FL 32810 USA.	walch@pbsj.com						0	0	0	0	9	AMER WATER WORKS ASSOC	DENVER	6666 W QUINCY AVE, DENVER, CO 80235 USA	0003-150X			J AM WATER WORKS ASS	J.

As it stands now, the need to innovate management is highlighted by the current global financial and economic crisis. Its course requires analyzing the causes and redefining the philosophy, content and objectives of management, to meet the needs of globalization and of the 21st century. The present theory of management was established more than a hundred years ago, and its modernization has focused mainly on the automation of processing the data of quantitative development of corporate and social phenomena. New directions and objectives of management should focus more on accountability, ethical decision-making and increasing the working motivation and creative fulfilment of strategic objectives and business activities.

An exploration of South African corporate communication practices and trends	COMMUNICARE-JOURNAL FOR COMMUNICATION SCIENCES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article							PUBLIC-RELATIONS	This study explored the status of corporate communication in selected South African companies. The main purpose of the study was to determine the levels of corporate communication knowledge and practical abilities of top corporate communication professionals. The research design adopted was a mixed method approach utilising a sequential transformatory model. The sample, selected through purposive and convenience sampling, consisted of twenty- six professionals drawn from a wide range of businesses and sectors in South Africa. The study indicates that corporate communication professionals deal with stakeholder-relationship management and perceive their roles as being strategic, then managerial, and lastly technical in nature, which is however often not practically applied. Furthermore, the study alludes to the fact that the corporate communication professionals concerned had a basic understanding of the strategic issues where the strategic implications of issues of publicity, company image and reputation were seemingly grasped by professionals. This highlights the need for continuous training in corporate communication - particularly at the strategic level-although it is apparent that corporate communication professionals need to be schooled continuously in a fundamental understanding and analysis of power relations, ranging from the most basic interpersonal levels to the socio- political contexts. Such training may allude to how these contexts, these relations, affect the way in which practitioners put it into practice. The study forms part of an international benchmarking survey that aims to contribute to a better understanding of corporate communication best practices worldwide.

J	Parikh, M				Parikh, Margie			Arco Limited: Launch and Closure of a Ready Mix Cement Plant	ASIAN CASE RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article						India; ready mix cement; market entry; location		Arco Limited: Launch and Closure of a Ready Mix Cement Plant. Arco Limited was a Projects and Infrastructure-sector conglomerate. Some of its key officials believed that entering the Ready Mix Cement (RMC) could be beneficial for Arco and planned entry into the manufacturing of RMC through its subsidiary, EG Ltd. (EGL). A feasibility report was ordered in 2004 on the basis of preliminary market leads which included detailed survey reports. Kolkata was identified as one of the locations for the business where high growth potential was sensed. Projections were made for demand and cost components. Government-prescribed formalities associated with starting the business were identified. Two alternate locations for Kolkata were identified and one of these two was recommended. Cement was one critical component for the business but the company did not have its own source of cement. One strategic option recommended was to tie up with one of the cement companies on back end. Alternatively, since the conversion of potential demand into orders depended upon construction projects, a tie up with a construction company on the front end could also be possible. There was a delay of a year in commissioning the plant and thereafter a number of factors caused the projections to be revised. The senior General Manager rejected and returned the revisions in the estimates apparently because of the managerial failure to foresee the market realities. After a few months' operations and losses, EGL closed down the RMC operations and rented it out because "it was actually a stupid decision." This case deals with challenges in decision making in uncertain environments.

J	Pinto, F				Pinto, Fulvia			Territory Management and Great Transformations in the City Region of Milan	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			Italian	Article								This study analyses the great transformations under way in the "city region" of Milan, investigating instruments, strategies and policies pursued. The meaning of "city region" is a territory formed of multidirectional relations, without hierarchic relations between center and outskirt, unlike the metropolitan area that is defined by relations of dependency (economic, social and functional) of the suburban built-up area on the main city. The city region of Milan is one of the most active and productive centers at national and European level, even so this territory has a low urban and environmental quality and it is characterized by polarization and social fragmentation raising cases that have negative reverberations on development opportunity of the area. Latest planning instruments of the area aim to territorial cohesion, attempting to design a new shape for the fragmented territory, improving the city region polycentrism, promoting the identification of intermediate city aggregations. Forms of coordinated government becomes fundamental to achieve urban and environmental redevelopment. The processes of transformation in the last years in the "city region" of Milan have confirmed the historical guiding of the territorial development, but the more important participations in existence and in realization, have widened the role and the weight of the aces North - West (Bovisa) and North (Bicocca, Ansaldo, Falck) respect to other city aces. The weight of the northern areas have been strengthened from the widening of the airport of Malpensa and from the "high speed" in the Central Station. During the last years some meaningful signs of resumption have been in the urban field. The transformation, the recovery and the valorization of the city territory project Milan towards a new urban order, typical of modern great city. The study analyzes the withins of participation and the strategies that serve to increase the inhabited offer, to improve the services publics, to define a new system of transports and green areas. Special attention is given to the mobility matter that needs strategies aiming to solve traffic congestion troubles not regarding only the zoning driven effect but also regarding its causes. Management instruments and procedures are needed to reach a dynamic balance between traffic flows attracted by local activities and traffic flows sustainable for existing transportation infrastructures. It's good to point out that traditional urban and land planning instruments are supported by "strategic planning". Both "Provincia di Milano" and municipality aim to improve urban and environmental quality of the city region of Milan. In brief, the study aims to outline a scenery of territorial transformation under way, considering criticality and potentiality and, contextually, it aims to verify the opportunity to convert urban policy objectives in operative actions.

J	Potter, JA; Lipinski, J				Potter, Jodi A.; Lipinski, John			KEY FACTORS FOR HASTENING THE STRATEGIC ISSUE DIAGNOSIS PROCESS: A WITHIN ORGANISATIONAL MODEL	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Strategic issue diagnosis; environmental scanning and decision-making		Previous research on Strategic Issue Diagnosis (SID) had focused on the complexity and novelty associated with the decision-making process in a turbulent environment. What had not been previously addressed in the extant literature is the requirement for speed inherent within the SID process, especially that is related to the gathering of information and facts through an organisation's environmental scanning procedures. Since proactive management techniques, nimble processes, and systems that allow an organisation to be responsive and build rapid decision-making capabilities are important determinants of success in a turbulent environment, the element of speed associated with SID is an important factor. Our paper identifies a series of propositions focusing attention on elements of the environmental scanning processes and management hierarchies that are intended to counteract the recursiveness and redundancy inherent in SID systems and ultimately hasten the strategic decision-making process.

The strategic roles played by Human Resources Management (HRM) have earned workers a critical position since the 1990s. During this period, there have been some important changes in the environment in and around enterprises, as well as in the qualifications of employees. The obligation of being successful in an environment with rapid changes and fierce competition has encouraged enterprises to struggle to hire and retain the best employees. This trend has affected the relationships between employees and their organizations, resulting in an increased mutual dependence. HRM has struggled to balance these relationships with its "border role". This paper attempts to analyze new functions of HRM and, using both quantitative and qualitative data, focuses on the question of where it places itself with respect to its "border role".

J	Lahovnik, M				Lahovnik, Matej			The Transition of Joint Stock Companies in Slovenia: Shareholder-Value Approach versus Stakeholder-Value Approach	SOUTH EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS			English	Article						corporate governance; shareholders; stakeholders; transition		In the shareholder theory of firms, the company's assets are the property of the shareholders, and managers are viewed as agents of the shareholders with all of the enforcement difficulties associated with agency relationships, but without legal obligations to any other stakeholder. An alternative view is the stakeholder theory of firms. The standard principal-agent paradigm can be expanded to the stakeholder agency problem. In this view, managers can be seen as the agents of all stakeholders. From the perspective of social responsibility, enlightened organizations view the internal and external environment as a variety of stakeholders. This paper offers some insightsinto the characteristics of the corporate governance system in Slovenia. Its focus is on the relationship between governance and management. The authors tried to determine in their research the roles of various groups of stakeholders in Slovenian companies. The paper's conclusions are based on a longitudinal research method. The paper is the result of three consecutive research studies on the characteristics of corporate governance in Slovenia over the period from 1998 to 2006. The paper compares the results from studies conducted in 1998 and 2002 with the latest results in 2006. The most important long- term strategic objective of Slovenian companies is growth. The share of Slovenian companies-excluding equity opportunity costs - has decreased significantly in the last six years due to the consolidation of ownership structures. The controlling owners are more active in setting the required rate of return on their equity investments. There is no conflict of interest between internal and external shareholders in most companies. Obviously, Slovenian companies have changed their strategic behaviour to reflect the interests of their stakeholders. It may be argued that some stakeholders, like customers and employees, are even more important for Slovenian managers than the owners.

One main aspect of the quality of supply is the non-availability of supply, which strongly depends on the duration of the restoration process after incidents and therefore on the availability of resources. Focusing on the operational processes after incidents in low-. medium-, and high-voltage grids, this paper presents a detailed grid operation model which allows to quantify the relation between the configuration of resources and the corresponding costs and quality of supply. To assess the "risk" of incidents with no interruption of supply, the power-at-risk is introduced. Depending on legal, regulatory, or strategic requirements, the model allows to evaluate and compare different configurations of resources and the resulting quality of supply. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

For Bangladesh, lead time is fast emerging as a serious bottleneck Backward linkages are playing major part of a garment industry to reduce lead time and offer competitive price in the international market. It is inevitable that one of the major issues of success in readymade garment (RMG) industry in Bangladesh intensely depends on backward linkages status, support, and strategic formulation. This paper will briefly discuss the present condition of backward integration comparison to other countries, impact of lead time, why lead time get priorities, process of short lead time and how central backward linkages and central bonded house influence on price competitiveness and alternative solution of backward linkages in the short-run considered central bonded warehouse (CBW) in the RMG sector Finally this paper will focus on policy implication on backward Linkage sub-sectors, scheme of intensifying central bonded warehouse (CBW) facility, procedure for short lead time in respect of free trade apparel market.

EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF TAXATION IN SUBSOIL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT: FORMATION CRITERIA AND ESTIMATION PARAMETERS	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						effective taxation; oil-production enterprises; criteria; estimation parameters		The existing taxation system of subsurface resources users has the following vital imperfections: - fiscal taxation predomination; - irregularity in rent comings distribution over the budget levels of the Russian Federation; - absence of distinct strategy of rent comings use; - accounting and technical difficulty of privileges use by oil-production enterprises, first of all, MET, as provided for in the legislation; - undeveloped system of tax formation bases under MET depending on geological-geographical characteristics and worked-out deposits; - absence of reproduction taxation aspect in subsoil resources management; - low competition in oil industry due to the tendency of socialisation of oil and gas sector; - absence of tax mechanisms encouraging business development in the long-run perspective. Thus, the existing taxation system does not encourage rational and effective subsurface resources use. It is necessary to develop theoretical justification and to form new effective taxation system for mining operations. The authors offer the following criteria for building an effective taxation system for mining operations: 1. Coordination of competing demands of mining operation subjects based on the principles of justice, ecological imperative, ecological and economic safety of state paying attention to the interests of native minorities and future generations. 2. Distinctiveness and methodical simplicity of taxation and accounting-production possibility of use. 3. Differentiation of taxation depending on natural resources types, their reproduction peculiarities, strategic importance, and geological-geographic characteristics of a deposit. 4. Direction to provide wide reproduction of natural resources. 5. Combination of economic, social and ecological effectiveness in mining operation with the priority of ecology. 6. Encouragement of improvement of ecological-economic effective natural resources use, and their complex, eco-friendly and maximum wasteless extraction. 7. Provision of innovative-investing incentives and possibilities for subsoil resources users. 8. Compliance with the strategic goals of the state development aimed at the socially oriented civil society formation. Thus, the effective taxation system in mining operation is a taxation system organisation providing fair combination of competing demands of all subsoil resources users, basing on ecological and social principles of taxation system under an optimal tax duty depending on natural-geographic and other peculiarities of deposits. The taxation system should encourage rational and effective mining operation aimed at the realisation of strategic goals of society development.

Many authors have stressed the importance of contextual effects on reference price formation (Rajendran and Tellis 1994, Mazumdar et al. 2005). The main objective of the current work is therefore to examine the effect of contextual and temporal influences on consumers' reference price formation during the buying process, using a simulated experiment. We developed a tool called SSPD as a way to measure contextual and temporal influences on reference price formation. The theoretical assumptions proposed here are tested through an ad-hoc computer-simulated experimental context that allows considerable control and new measurement possibilities.

MONO ANDROGEN BLOCKADE AND THE RISK OF RECURRENCE IN MEN WITH LOCALIZED PROSTATE CANCER UNDER GOING BRACHYTHERAPY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS			English	Article						Prostatic neoplasms; Hormonal therapy; Radiation therapy; Brachytherapy	RADIATION-THERAPY; BIOCHEMICAL FAILURE; HORMONAL-THERAPY; DEPRIVATION; RADIOTHERAPY; SUPPRESSION; MANAGEMENT; CAPSURE; TRIAL	Purpose: We examined whether maximum androgen blockade (MAB) is associated with a decreased recurrence risk vs. single-agent androgen suppression (monotherapy) for men undergoing brachytherapy (BT) for localized prostate cancer. Methods and Materials: Data from 223 men in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor database who received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) concurrent with BT for intermediate- or high-risk prostatic adenocarcinoma were included; 159 (71%) received MAB, and 64 (29%) monotherapy (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist or anti-androgen alone). Cox regression analysis was performed to assess whether the choice of ADT was associated with disease recurrence adjusting for known prognostic factors. Results: Men who received MAB had similar Gleason scores, T categories, and pretreatment prostate-specific antigen as those who received monotherapy. After a median follow-up of 49 months, the use of MAB was not associated with a decrease in the risk recurrence (p = 0.72), after adjusting for known prognostic factors. A higher PSA at diagnosis (p = 0.03) and younger age at diagnosis (p < 0.01) were associated with increased recurrence risk. The 3-year recurrence free survival was 76% for patients in both monotherapy and MAB groups. Conclusions: There are varied practice patterns in physicians' choice of the extent of concurrent ADT when used with brachytherapy for men with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer. Given a lack of demonstrated superiority from either ADT choice, both appear to be reasonable options. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The buyer who hopes to fulfill a project has two options. First, she may award the project to the old provider with an efficient quality by bargaining. Second, she may give the project to the firm who submits the lowest bid through a simple procurement second-price sealed-bid auction with a pre-fixed quality. We compare the expected revenue in the auction with the deterministic profit of the bargaining. In different parameters cases, we find the borderline functions between the two options with respect to the buyer's bargaining power and the amount of bidders. We also compare our simple procurement auction (SPA) with the optimal multidimensional bid auction by Che (1993), and find our model protects the buyer's private valuation information by forfeiting some profits. Some properties of the difference between the two auctions are proposed, especially there is no revenue difference when the amount of bidders approaches infinity.

OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						collaborative demand-to-supply management; aggregate planning; strategic map; production scheduler; sustainable company; progressive analysis		In recent years, collaborative demand-to-supply management, which strategically supplies products to the market in order to maximize profit, has played a critical role in establishing a sustainable company. However, the sales function and the production function do not always work together for profit optimization. In most cases, the sales function is responsible for maximizing sales. On the other hand, the production function is responsible for minimizing production cost. In the SCM age, this situation causes production of excess inventory as well as long order fulfillment time. For the collaboration of both functions, a strategic demand-to-supply map has been developed. The strategic map consists of a row and a column indicating the demand speed and the smoothing factor for demand forecasting. This paper presents a theory and a planning tool, called the planner, for collaborative demand-to-supply management based on the strategic map. The planner consists of demand forecasting, aggregate planning, the strategic map, the scheduler, and progressive analysis. The effectiveness of the planner is demonstrated with a numerical example. In addition, this paper shows that the planner is a useful tool for staff in the sales department and the production department for training or understanding collaborative demand-to-supply management. This paper also presents the potential areas of future research and development of collaborative demand-to-supply management and the planner.

J	Blackburn, F				Blackburn, Fiona			Learning on the job: collection management, and aspects of cross-cultural provision	AUSTRALIAN LIBRARY JOURNAL			English	Article								What does a newcomer to the library industry bring, at nearly fifty? What does she find? Reflecting on her experience and a recent study tour, the author describes the barely-skilled-although-nominally-qualified challenge; and discusses current cross-cultural provision. She muses on the interplay between a new librarian's fresh eyes, experience and strong commitments; racism; possible sources of prejudice; organisational focus; and place, in shaping provision. That public libraries have a strategic and comprehensive approach to cross-cultural provision is a particular concern. Where Indigenous knowledge collections have unrestricted access, effort should be put into building non-indigenous engagement with the riches in these collections. This will serve to strengthen the library's position in the community and, in expanding non-indigenous patrons' knowledge of their community, build cross-cultural understanding.				fblackburn@astc.nt.gov.au					*AB COMM STRAT PLA, 2007, KOOR LIB PATHW PROJ; *ATSILIRN, 2005, ATSILIRN PROT ABO TO; Blackburn F, 2008, DREAM 08 AUSTR LIB I; FLAGG S, 2008, FOOTSTEPS JOURNEY LU; Gibson J., 2008, AUSTR INDIGENOUS DIG; *HUM RIGHTS EQ OPP, 1997, BRING THEN HOM REP N; NSLA, 2007, NAT POL FRAM AB TORR; WOODHOUSE L, 2008, DREAM 08 AUSTR LIB I	8	0	0	0	4	AUSTRALIAN LIBRARY & INFORMATION ASSOC LTD	KINGSTON	PO BOX 6335, KINGSTON, ACT 2604, AUSTRALIA	0004-9670			AUST LIBR J	Aust.

In consonance with the evolutionary perspective, the concept of value chain was introduced as an analytical framework with potential to analyze the competitive dynamic of the clusters. It shows the elements that seem to be appropriate to the study of the furniture production chain, based on the proposed structure. The main contribution of this research consists in the proposal of an analytical framework of easy application that permits classifying the organizations from an APL cluster according to the strategic and competitive standards, and also identify the characteristics that deserve to be highlighted and maybe validate a special attention from the entrepreneurs and the policy makers.

We realized a case study of this agency, which promotes and support several leading companies within highly competitive economic sectors like retail of electronic devices, sporting goods, and watchmaker industry, among others. The case shows that BtoB thriving forces, in a co-evolution combination, enhance and accelerate the learning curve of its partners, building up dynamic capacities aiming to create competitive advantages. It showed a permanent search of differentiation to deliver real value for the clients and better participation in their market share, through complete management commitments in the relationship between the BtoB and its partners. This study demonstrates also that the three different stakeholders: clients, employees and agency management, are strongly integrated in the innovation process, promoting the common growth for both clients and advertising agency.

Therefore, a bibliographical research was realized, identifying the main concepts of professional sustainability and competencies, fundamental marks for the creation of a career based on delivery behavior and on the protean myth. Between the various related factors, we may highlight that the protean career is centered on the competencies of a flexible, adaptive and strategic-minded professional, with insight of future, compatible with the market needs and planning a sustainable career. It was also stated that the concepts of delivery behavior are meant as important and relevant by professionals, notwithstanding the variations in the rate and complexity of the enterprise competencies development. At last, it is possible to conclude that the professionals are strongly committed to act along a logical transformation pattern, so as to create a more competitive and sustainable professional career.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS APPROACH			English	Article						Computerization of Society; Digital Government; Human Rights; Information Technology Adoption; Personal Privacy; Privacy Rights; Security Management		The objective of this article reflects upon the isomorphic relationship between ideas across disciplines. In this instance we are considering the value of a well established methodology, cross methodology, adopted from macroeconomics and ideas from political science. The cross methodology is used as a means of considering if the relationship between data collected for security proposes and individual privacy. We argue that this relationship is moving towards a symbiotic relationship and away from a synergistic one. In the article we present a model which we transform using system thinking and applying it within the context of security and privacy at the strategic level. The article is about the relationship between security, information and control and the effect that increased surveillance has upon individual privacy and freedom.

Next-Generation Strategic Business Model for the U.S. Internet Service Providers: Rate-Based Internet Subscription	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Business Model; Consumer Behavior; Digital Contents; Digital Data Packet; Information Network Bandwidth; Internet Service Provider; Price Elasticity; Price Discrimination; Statistical Input Analysis; Variable Rate Subscription		The (information digital) network bandwidth and its usage through Internet subscription, by far, is perhaps the only uni-modal commodity provided to today's consumers at a flat rate. Regardless of his/her actual bandwidth usage, a consumer is charged a uniform subscription fee by the Internet Service Providers (ISP). Meanwhile, the ISPs have a considerable stake in the overall infrastructure which supports the local perimeters of the Internet. This article presents a rigorous statistical analysis with the objective of determining the optimal billing or pricing policy for the ISPs of the U.S. on the basis of the proposed 'variable subscription-rate' business model. Two leading global consumer profiles were selected for data comparison on a cardinal scale; NYC, NY, U.S.A. and Seoul, South Korea.

J	Galderisi, A; Ceudech, A				Galderisi, Adriana; Ceudech, Andrea			Mobility Network and Safety	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			Italian	Article								A key point to explore the relationship between mobility and security is the role of mobility networks for ensuring territorial safety with respect to natural and man-made hazards. For many years, increasing the security of settled communities against hazards has represented one of the main target of the strategies meant to address a sustainable urban and territorial development. Mobility networks play a crucial role in that context. They represent a basic support for the community's everyday life, on which health, comfort and a large part of economic activities depend; moreover, they represent exposed elements often characterized by high vulnerability to different hazards and, in the meanwhile, strategic equipments for the emergency management. The damage or the reduced functionality of those networks can increase the loss of human lives caused by an hazardous event as well as produce relevant economic damages at medium and long term. Besides, by extending the investigation field from the networks meant as physical supports to the flows of goods along them, the impacts of an hazardous event on such elements can provoke relevant secondary events (toxic releases, explosions and so on). Although the relevance of the mobility networks in assuring territorial safety is at present largely recognized, risk analyses have been long focused on buildings' vulnerability or, even where they have paid attention to the mobility networks, they mainly stressed the physical damages that a given event could produce to the single elements of such networks. It is still recent the awareness that mobility networks represent a system, characterized by relevant interdependences: either because each element of the network is linked to all the others, or because there are several interdependences not only among the different typologies of network infrastructure, but also among network infrastructure and urban systems. Starting from the above assumptions, this paper points out the several aspects of the vulnerability of mobility networks and their relevance in determining the vulnerability of a territorial or urban system to hazardous events. Therefore, it is suggested an indepth investigation of the concept of vulnerability of the mobility networks, in order to highlight the aspects mostly analyzed until now. Finally, a case study in the Campania Region has been provided in order to point out how the traditional risk analyses, usually based on single hazardous events, can sometimes led to invest in the improvement and adjustment of mobility networks which, targeted to increase the security of a territory, on the contrary, produce an increase of the territorial vulnerability. The case study is part of a wider study developed by the authors within the Italian Research Project (PRIN) 2006-2008 entitled "Early warning Systems: technical, urban planning and communication aspects".

Structural modeling approach to the strategic learning process in acquisition context	KUWAIT JOURNAL OF SCIENCE & ENGINEERING			English	Article						Strategic management; learning; acquisition; knowledge management; sense making; structural equation modelling		To have a good response from environmental changes and a long-term guide to move from present to future, organizations need to focus on feedback from their actions and use them effectively in modifying their strategies. The process of strategic learning can help organizations to continue expanding their capacity and have a flexible strategy to create the truly desired results. This study aims to explore the phenomenon of strategic learning for a better understanding of the concept of the acquisition learning process. A structural modeling approach has been developed to examine the relationship between the key constructs of strategic learning in the acquisition context. A questionnaire was sent electronically to 212 companies in the UK that have experience in acquisition. The collected data were analyzed using LISREL as a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) software. The results of this study show that lessons learned from past acquisitions, and the media for transferring these lessons, are the main factors that have effects on strategic learning in all acquisition context.

J	Ismail, NA				Ismail, Noor Azizi			INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SOPHISTICATION, MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING INFORMATION PROVISION AND COMPUTER-BASED INFORMATION SYSTEMS SUCCESS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Information technology; information systems; management accounting system; accounting information systems; small and medium enterprises		The emergence of a knowledge-based economy, consequent to the advancement in information technology (IT), puts more pressure on businesses to generate information to quickly create technologically advanced and customised products at relatively low costs. Firms, particularly small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), need to understand and rely more on strategic accounting information and recognise the potential that IT has in generating these information. This paper reports the results of a study which off ers an explanation for the relationship between IT sophistication and computer-based information systems (CBIS) success of SMEs, by incorporating into the model the provision of management accounting information (MAI provision). Data were collected from 214 SMEs in Malaysia by way of a questionnaire-based survey. The results showed that IT sophistication is a determinant of MAI provision, which in turn, is a determinant of CBIS success. Overall, the results suggested that MAI provision plays a mediating role in the relationship between IT sophistication and CBIS success of SMEs. An interpretation of these results is that those SMES which employ sophisticated IT can generate suffi cient management accounting information and thereby improve their CBIS.

J	Daly, K				Daly, Kara			Generic Versus Branded Pharmaceutical Strategic Considerations: An Irish Focus With Global Perspective	DRUG INFORMATION JOURNAL			English	Article						Generic; Generics market; Proprietary medications; Generic substitution; Strategy		This article seeks to explore strategic considerations in the competition between generic and branded pharma drugs in Ireland. In a global environment, with trends in cost-saving substitution models and growing consumer awareness, Ireland has remained a high-price under-genericized market. Irish government initiatives toward control of drug expenses are influenced by factors such as quality, reliability of supply, and public perception and concerns. Other elements affecting market trends are changes in regulatory requirements, number of competitors, and health professionals' preferences. These variables, among others, drive the necessity for strong strategy portfolios to be undertaken by the branded and generics industry alike. Indeed, such strategies may incorporate activities such as lobbying, negotiation, patent protection, brand defense, life cycle management, consolidation, and driving consumer awareness.

A comparative perspective in face-to-face and virtual environments	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY			Spanish	Article						time management; study planning; traditional context; virtual context		Introduction. Time and environment management are considered key aspects and strategic behaviors for learning. Still more in virtual environments where the student has freedom to organize time and to choose study atmospheres. In this line, this paper present comparative data about use that two students groups - virtual and traditional- do of strategies referred to space and time planning. Method. 30 students participated in the investigation who attended a Masters dictated with traditional modality and other 41 students who also attended level of Masters but in an online context. All of them gave answer, towards the end of the attended one, to Study Habits Inventory that, among others aspects, evaluate behaviors referred to learning and study planning. Results: T test with independent samples inform significant differences between both groups with respect to time and atmosphere management. The sense of differences favors virtual students, who informed a more rigorous and strategic time and space management. Discussion. The found results seem to give sustenance to present tendencies; they indicate to the significance of the educative contexts and its impact on learning; it seems that the greater time flexibility and the greater autonomy to choose learning atmospheres that grant the virtual education - added to the personal characteristics of the virtual students-result in a greater emphasis from the student to regulate these aspects.

J	Pawitra, T				Pawitra, Teddy			Experiential Insights from Managing Joint Ventures in Indonesia : Reflection on Past Lessons and Future Challenges	SOUTH EAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						joint venture; foreign direct investments; magnitude of investment Indonesia; wholly owned subsidiaries		Joint ventures as one of the many forms of strategic alliance are now ubiquitous phenomena in most Asian countries such as Indonesia and others. The trend to establish joint ventures with foreign firms has been growing in popularity since the onset of 1980s. In 2007, the value of realized foreign direct investments in Indonesia had reached USD 9,076.6 million which represented 842 projects (Investment Coordinating Board, Oct. 2007)' However; particular data regarding the magnitude of investment in joint ventures are not available because foreign direct investments are not further specified into joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries. The development of joint ventures is more discernible if we turn to the international business arena. Over the past few years more than 5000 joint ventures have been established and the largest world 100 joint ventures represent more than USD 350 billion in combined annual revenues (Bamford, Erns and Fubini, 2004).

J	Yadav, V; Jaiswal, M				Yadav, Vanita; Jaiswal, Mahadeo			Supplier Capabilities and eSourcing Relationships: A Psychological Contract Perspective	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						E-Sourcing; Offshoring; Outsourcing; Psychological Contract; Relationship Management; Supplier Capabilities		The forces of globalization have influenced organizations to extend the concept of IT outsourcing to IT-intensive business process outsourcing (eSourcing). Most of the research on managing outsourcing relationships has focused either on legal contracts or on strategic partnerships. Advocating a different viewpoint, researchers like Rousseau (1995) found that in reality everyday working of contractual relationships was governed by individual's subjective interpretation and was fundamentally psychological in nature. The objective of this paper is to posit a relationship step model which projects a vital relationship management capability plus psychological contract perspective for eSourcing. It incorporates the stance of relational contract, interorganizational relationship and psychological contract theories. Using the qualitative research paradigm, the research model is preliminarily explored with case studies of two eSourcing suppliers. The exploratory results of this research indicate that relationship management capability of suppliers is an important factor shaping the outsourcing value proposition.

Identifying Conditions to Implement Strategic Knowledge Management in Brazilian Corporations SKM Math Model Application	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic knowledge; strategic knowledge management; strategist; decision maker; Brazilian companies		This is a step forward in researching about Strategic Knowledge Management - SKM. Firstly, an overview of SKM is presented and indicating the three integrative models: conceptual model, mathematical model and systemic model. After that, the SKM math model is deeply described in order to establish a framework to the study. The research objective was to evaluate conditions to implement SKM in Brazilian corporations. Thus, a methodology of four steps was applied: formulating a questionnaire, considering variables related to systemic factors - cognition, technology, organisational culture, managerial style and context - developing a Math Model Software, that was used to collect data and consolidating results by using a MS Excel; preparing a team of researches that comprised 29 students of the Intelligence Competitive MBA in the Universidade de Brasilia. The research considered 15 companies in Brazil, mostly public ones, and 56 strategists and decision makers were heard. Results revealed that the conditions are unfavorable to implement SKM model and improvement actions on systemic factors are considerably required.

J	Talebi, K				Talebi, Kambiz			Knowledge management issues in fast growth SMEs	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Capacity; entrepreneurship; Knowledge management; SMEs; Strategic Management		Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a study of knowledge management understanding and usage in small and medium knowledge-intensive enterprises. Design/methodology/approach The study has taken an interpretative approach, using two knowledge-intensive South ISFAHAN (Iran) companies as case studies, both of which are characterized by the need to process and use knowledge on a daily basis in order to remain competitive. The case studies were analyzed using qualitative research methodology, composed of interviews and concept mapping, thus deriving a characterization of understandings, perceptions and requirements of SMEs in relation to knowledge management. Findings The study provides evidence that, while SMEs, including knowledge intensive ones, acknowledge that adequately capturing, storing, sharing and disseminating knowledge can lead to greater innovation and productivity, their managers are not prepared to invest the relatively high effort on long term knowledge management goals for which they have difficulty in establishing the added value. Thus, knowledge management activities within SMEs tend to happen in an informal way, rarely supported by purposely desinged ICT system. Rescarch limitation/implication - This paper proposes that futher studies in this field are required that focus on organizational and pratical issuse in order to close the gap between theoretical propositions and the reality of practice. Practical implications - The study suggests that in order to implement an appropriate knowledge management strategy in SMEs cultural, behavioral, and organizational issuse need to be tackled before even considering technical issuse. Originality/value - KM seems to have been successfully applied in large companies, but it is largely disregarded by small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). This has been attributed primarily to lack of a formal approach to the sharing, recording, transferring, auditing and exploiting of organizational knowledge, together with lack of utilization of available information technologies.

J	Abdullah, N				Abdullah, Norlaila			THE APPLICATION OF MODERN MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING TECHNIQUES: A FIELD STUDY	ASIA-PACIFIC MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING JOURNAL			English	Article						Industries; adoption; strategic; modern; conventional management accounting practices		This study examines the management accounting (MA) practices adopted by companies in the local industries such as oil and gas, petrochemical, chemical, manufacturing and automobile. A sample comprising 40 local and multinational firms, was measured to determine the rate of adoption of the various MA practices. These practices were further classified as strategic, modem, and conventional for comparative purposes with other countries' emerging development. Some other variables such as production process (technology), production set up, product mix, and firm size (employee) affecting the use and rate of application of MA practices were considered. Findings revealed that firms' usage of the various classes of management accounting practices depended upon the sample origin, size, product lines and technology. Some surprising revelations on the MA applications were highlighted based on the field study conducted.

J	Beckett-Camarata, J; Camarata, M; Purton, G				Beckett-Camarata, Jane; Camarata, Michael; Purton, Gloria			A Strategic Regional Approach to Economic Development and School Funding in Ohio	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						economic development; school funding; fiscal regionalism		In recent years the economy in Ohio has faced major problems in two critical areas: local economic development and local school funding. Decreasing tax revenues from the state, such as Local Government Funds, along with unfunded mandates, have strained the financing of local public education and heightened attention on the current approach to and use of local economic development. Examining the relationship between local economic development and local school funding at this time may not only contribute to our understanding the underlying issues creating the problems but also lead to possible solutions. This article argues that economic development and public education funding are interrelated and are negatively affected by the current Ohio tax structure and recommends an integrated, strategic regional approach to local economic development and local school funding to provide long-term economic stability, as well as solid school funding. Although regionalism is not a new concept, it may be a realistic and workable solution for Ohio's economic development and school funding problems. However, a strategic regional approach to both economic development and school funding requires that both areas be addressed simultaneously through the tax structure. The study finds that Ohio may be ready for a strategic regional approach at this time, because many individual communities and their schools are failing economically and see little hope of reversing their situation using current, traditional strategies.

J	Brownlie, D				Brownlie, Douglas			Tales of prospects past: on strategic fallacies and uncertainty in Technology Forecasting	JOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Critical and contextual studies; Historicism; Narrative; Uncertainty; Practice		The paper contributes to the 25th anniversary celebrations by inviting readers to share a journey back to the early 1980s when the future of Marketing as an academic discipline remained unclear. At this time the author's academic future in marketing was also unclear. He was working in the area of Technology Forecasting, a highly specialised field, not only within social policy and techno-economics, but within the then emerging field of strategic marketing and its subaltern, environmental scanning. In the spirit of "The lessons of history" (Baker 2006) the paper revisits scenarios generated by the author 25 years ago regarding technological futures in the offshore oil and gas industry. It draws on the premise that understanding can be gained by taking a forecast, a knowledge claim, whose tenure is now over, and revisiting it in the light of the present which at the time of making the forecast was, of course, the future. In the arts this historicising approach to a subject is a necessary conjunction to the development of knowledge on matters of creativity, judgement and interpretation. The cultivation of aesthetic sensibilities takes place through disciplinary frameworks of historicism and comparative interpretation, widely known as 'critical and contextual studies'. This paper is the product of such study. It attempts to set knowledge claims in historical and cultural context, suggesting where critical marketing can contribute. The forecasts of technological development were generated by means of an international Delphi study which was conducted during 1980-1983. The paper reflects on the passage of time and the evolution of the offshore oil and gas industry against the flux and flow of circumstance and event. It discusses localised historical accounts of where and how the original futures scenarios have been found to diverge or otherwise from what has come to pass, reflecting on the framing of uncertainty by broader socio-technical discourses. In this way the paper illuminates the indeterminate and emergent nature of uncertainty and the implications of this for our understanding of decision making in marketing management.

J	Chang, CH				Chang, Chang-Hsing			An examination of interest rate risk of mercantile banks in China	JOURNAL OF STATISTICS & MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						banks; foreign currency; risk management		The paper uses econometric analysis to estimate the average asset and liability maturities for Chinese commercial banks. Regression models are then tested to determine if interest rate fluctuations have a significant impact on banks' net interest income. The researchers conclude that Chinese commercial banks are currently exposed to considerable interest rate risk, the exposure of medium-sized commercial banks being much larger than the exposure of larger banks, and that interest rate risk mitigation will become a strategic focus of private commercial banks in China's financial markets in coming years.

This paper also contributes to the growing body of research that disputes the tendency to use the alignment model as the single best way of guiding organisational strategic direction. While conventional views of alignment suggest that it is a rational and deliberate process, this study indicates that misalignment can also make sense, persist and even become instrumental in certain organisational circumstances. By using the misalignment model, the paper contributes to our understanding of how and why management tends to stick to a familiar strategy of action in spite of environmental threat.

J	Dubrovski, D				Dubrovski, Drago			Fuzzy Logic And Management Mistakes In Contemporary Corporate Decision-Making	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY RESEARCH			English	Article						complex environment; crisis; decision-making; management mistakes; transition		Intensive and extensive, radical and dynamic changes in the today's environment require adjusted, creative and innovative managerial developmental solutions, also based on the fuzzy logic, needed for strategic decision-making in contemporary business conditions, otherwise the management cannot be able to successfully ensure further existence and development to the organisations. Although the state of crisis in the company can be affected by various interrelated external and internal causes, which as to intensity and appearance vary by company, the essence of the causes surely lies in the management of the company. Despite the fact that the hypothesis of existing a pattern of management mistakes which follows the changes in political and economic environment cannot be completely reliably confirmed some outlines of such pattern are in spite of all seen. In highly complex business environment, characterized today by financial crisis, recession or slowdown of world or national economies, when much more fuzzy logic in management decision-making is needed, management mistakes can derive also from incapabilities to cope with such complex environment.

JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-JIEM			English	Article						incentive contract; moral hazard; successive duopoly; equilibrium		The central purpose of this paper is to examine the incentive contract as an equilibrium phenomenon. We analyse a model of vertical differentiation in which we deal with the strategic role of the competitor's decisions in a successive duopoly. Is it better for a processor to offer an incentive contract to an upstream producer or the spot market? We determine the equilibrium of a game in which the processors simultaneously decide whether to offer an incentive contract or to continue at the spot market to acquire their input. Our results show that under successive duopoly, offering an incentive contract constitutes the unique equilibrium solution, which highlights the incentive contract persistence.

J	Fuller, D; Sedo, DR; Thurlow, A				Fuller, Danielle; Sedo, DeNel Rehberg; Thurlow, Amy			More Than "Just a Little Library Program" Discourses of power in One Book, One Community programming committees	LOGOS-JOURNAL OF THE WORLD PUBLISHING COMMUNITY			English	Article						organizational legitimacy; One Book; One Community reading programs; discourse analysis		This article looks at issues of power in the relationships between the organizers of three city-wide book reading projects on the one hand, and their communities, funders, and partners on the other. We contend that a discourse of "organizational legitimacy" emerges from an analysis of discussions with the organizers of the reading programs. Organizational legitimacy here demonstrates that the power effects are self-regulated, as well as externally introduced, and that it has both strategic and ideological implications. Our identification and subsequent analysis of this specific discourse was achieved through the application of a critical discourse analysis (Van Dijk, 1993) designed to locate power and privilege in the production and reproduction of discursive language. We expand this analysis to employ a Foucauldian understanding of power in our analysis of the management strategies of libraries and partner organizations in book reading projects. Emerging from the discursive language highlighted in our analysis is a discourse of legitimacy reflective of a broader social discourse of capitalism. This discourse highlighted participation, democratic process, and funding concerns for individual participants as they tried to explain, describe, rationalize or question the "legitimacy" of their organization or initiative. This approach problematizes legitimacy as a discourse and allows for connections between the broader social discourse and the enactment of discourse at the local level.

The field of strategic management has already reached a level of maturity whilst the field of entrepreneurship continues to develop. Both have thus generated a vast amount of literature, with some papers being published in a group of influential journals. Authors such as Boyd et al. (2005) for strategic management and Fried (2003) or Linton (2006) for entrepreneurship have attempted to highlight the most widely recognized journals. Over the last decade some authors (Evans and Wurster, 1999; McGrath and MacMillan, 2000; Hitt et al., 2001, 2002; Ireland et al., 2001, 2003) have proposed merging the theory and research of both disciplines, leading to the emergence of the strategic entrepreneurship (SE) construct. Despite certain initial disagreements (Shane and Venkataraman, 2000), complementarities between the two fields seem to strongly support the idea of integration. Further, the publication of the Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal (an official journal of the Strategic Management Society) in 2007 heralded a significant milestone. However, the question arises as to which journals have thus far contributed to sustaining this integration, what support each has provided in the merging process, which can be considered a reference for current and future research in strategic entrepreneurship, and finally what level of recognition cited journals have reached in recent years. Using the Scopus database (from Elsevier) and the Web of Science and Journal Citation Reports in ISI Web of Knowledge databases (from Thomson) as sources of information and analysing the period between 2000 and 2008, we have attempted to answer these questions. Our analysis reveals that over the last decade SE literature has evidenced a clear growth. A wide range of differing journals have contributed to this, although a prominent role has been played by those more closely linked to the field of entrepreneurship. Based on the recognition achieved by certain journals, a group of publications is proposed as a reference framework for SE researchers.

J	Ghazali, M; McBean, EA				Ghazali, Mirnader; McBean, Edward A.			Current Technologies for On-Line Monitoring of Drinking Water in Distribution Systems	JOURNAL OF WATER MANAGEMENT MODELING			English	Article								Increased risks of drinking water contamination are incentives for implementation of improved monitoring approaches for pathogens in drinking water distribution systems. However, indirect measurements such as pH, and turbidity to detect pathogens do not guarantee the safety of drinking water because pathogens, and especially protozoa and viruses, are not well correlated to these indirect measures. Routine methods for culturing indicator micro-organisms need considerable time and hence do not provide significant value for real-time monitoring efforts. Review of currently available technologies (spectral fluorescence laser technology, image processing technology, multi-angle light scattering laser technology, on-line chemical characterization system, decision support monitoring system, and rapid response tests for total micro-organisms and toxicity) for real-time and/ or rapid pathogen detection, demonstrates there is no single instrument currently available. The most effective approach currently available is demonstrated to involve the identification of the presence of a pathogen, and the instigation of collection of a sample for more detailed analyses for confirmation.

This particular pharmaceutical company was chosen for the case study because it won the award for "the application of the most effective management accounting system, tool or technique that has had a positive impact on daily practice. This application may have led to quality or process improvement, improved efficiency, lowered costs, or otherwise addressed a particular problem in the workplace."Many companies have problems executing their strategies leading to the realization of lower financial and non-financial performance. The study investigates how this company used management accounting as a tool to align itself with the overall corporate strategic objectives. It also investigates the strategies involving the use of different financial leverage which affects the perfonnance of this company.

J	Janardhanan, N				Janardhanan, Nandakumar			China's search for energy and its strategy towards Central Asia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Energy sources; China; Central Asia; International politics		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a view on China's energy search towards Central Asia and the strategy the country adopts in order to enhance its political and economic reach in the region. Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines the strategy of China in outmanoeuvring other major energy competitors in the Central Asian region. The analysis also looks at China's strategic leverage in the region over other extra regional powers which are increasingly finding it difficult to overcome the Chinese influence over the energy rich Central Asian countries. Findings - China's presence in the Central Asian region would continue to be a major concern for other extra regional powers that seek to enter into the region's energy sector. Though countries such as the USA, India, and Russia have undeniable importance to a great extent in the region, the years to come would evince China playing a leading role vis-a-vis its interaction with Central Asia. Research limitations/implications - Though the bandwidth of the political interactions and involvement of Russia and USA are significantly larger than that of China, the region's energy sector would be strategic determinant in shaping the Central Asian states' relations and interactions with the outside world. As the analysis used in this paper is primarily meant to examine China's energy search in Central Asia, issues related to other purely political and economic arena are not extensively discussed. Originality/value - The paper is the original work of the author. The analysis provided in the paper is based on the facts and information on China's energy search in the Central Asian region. The paper provides analysis of the Chinese energy strategy in Central Asia.

J	Jarratt, D				Jarratt, Denise			Organizational preconditions supporting relationship management capability renewal	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						relationship management; organizational capabilities; learning orientation		The Resource-Advantage Theory of Competition established that comparative advantage is a consequence of an organization's capacity to renew critical resources such as an organization's relationship management capability. To date, only limited research has been undertaken on organizational preconditions that support capability renewal. A survey was mailed to senior executives of 1500 manufacturing and service firms in the UK. The structural model representing the hypothesized relationships between a learning orientation, learning structures and relationship management capability renewal was shown to be robust with a Comparative Fit Index of 0.90. This research has established that structural dimensions important to facilitating learning about relationship management systems, processes and behavior include collectivist structures and the ability of employees to cross functional and hierarchical boundaries to access knowledge.

J	Kayacetin, NC; Tanyer, AM				Kayacetin, Nuri Chan; Tanyer, Ali Murat			EXPLORING KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN THE PRACTICE OF ARCHITECTURE: A PILOT STUDY IN THE TURKISH CAPITAL	METU JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF ARCHITECTURE			English	Article						architecture; computer aided design; information technology; knowledge management; professional practice		The Architecture-Engineering-Construction industry has recently been altering the ways of managing its resources. Knowledge is considered to be among the most precious of these resources. Knowledge is a critical factor in choosing the right projects, preparing the winning bids and successfully realizing the projects. It is also a critical factor for organizations because of the fact that - due to its nature that it exists as tacit or explicit, or in between - it is hard to record and reuse. This paper provides a pilot study in order to investigate the knowledge management issue in the practice of architecture. The study has been carried out in the Cankaya district of Ankara. Face-to-face interviews have been carried out with the head architects of 15 architectural offices. The subject domain is assumed to be experiencing the problems such as managing knowledge at a strategic level. This is due to the facts that the amount and importance of tacit knowledge is significant and communication of this knowledge to other parties is the responsibility of the architectural partners. The survey found out that management of architectural knowledge is considered to be beneficial for the overall productivity of architectural offices. However, challenges such as lack of standard procedures and low profit margins in the AEC industry render knowledge management to be less effective on overall profit and innovation in design.

J	King, MA				King, Michael A.			A Realistic Data Warehouse Project: An Integration of Microsoft Access (R) and Microsoft Excel (R) Advanced Features and Skills	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-INNOVATIONS IN PRACTICE			English	Article						Data warehouse; star schema; dimensional modeling; pivot tables; Microsoft Access; Microsoft Excel; random variable generation		Business intelligence derived from data warehousing and data mining has become one of the most strategic management tools today, providing organizations with long-term competitive advantages. Business school curriculums and popular database textbooks cover data warehousing, but the examples and problem sets typically are small and unrealistic. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of how to construct a realistic data warehouse using numerous advanced features available in Microsoft Access and Microsoft Excel. Large fact table creation is demonstrated, which subsequently allows for the development of meaningful queries and cross tab analysis utilizing pivot tables. Fact table sizes of one million records can be iteratively developed and quickly imported into databases such as Microsoft Access or MySQL. A short discussion on the benefits of using Microsoft Access Query by Example and completely bypassing the complexities of advanced SQL is included. With the resulting fact table, students can experiment with several indexing techniques, usually only conceptually discussed in textbooks, and measure a series of index effectiveness. This paper includes a brief discussion of enterprise-level data requirements, the differences between dimensional and relational modeling, data warehouse schemas, and enterprise data flow concepts, along with a demonstration of business modeling concepts, such as random variable generation and probability distributions. As a case example, this data warehouse project utilizes a public retail corporation with an excellent online presence to provide the student with a real data extract, transform and load hands on experience. General financial data and colorful background information about the corporation is provided.

In the first part of the article concerns the basic theoretical knowledge behind a partnership marketing. Moreover, the theory of strategic learning of that form of marketing and the essence of the loyalty programmes were described. The paper's second part was devoted to the nature of tourist services and their specialty. In the third partthe author discusses the model of partnership marketing in tourism. The model consists of the interactions between a tourist company and its environment. The main elements of the interaction system within the framework of partnership marketing are the integrated elements of marketing which are communicated to the receivers (customers) through the use of media. In the partnership marketing, contrary to the traditional marketing, the databases which are the basis of the design of the loyalty programmes, are shared. In its final part, the article contains the conclusions for the tourist industry regarding the use of marketing instruments connected with the implementation of partnership marketing.

Time and Form Postponement Competition under Dynamic Behavior of Demand	OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						strategic planning; supply chain management; game theory; managerial flexibility; market share; collaborative agents		This paper studies assembly-to-order (form postponement) and make-to-stock (time postponement) duopolistic competition under dynamic price and production strategies for two differentiable products, which share common components at a certain degree of substitution. Both strategies are benchmarked according to the Bertrand and Cournot Stackelberg game. In addition, dynamic game is applied to show the long term effect of both strategic decisions (price and production quantity) on profit and against demand uncertainty. The results show that precommited production is appropriate for high modular products and precommited price for special orders.

J	Lassila, J; Tanskanen, A; Lohjala, J; Partanen, J				Lassila, Jukka; Tanskanen, Anna; Lohjala, Juha; Partanen, Jarmo			Unbundling of operation and network development activities in electricity distribution	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Electricity industry; Network operating systems; Long-term planning; Outsourcing; Performance measures		Purpose - Based on literature and an empirical case, the purpose of this paper is to present a framework for decision-making in utilities where unbundling considerations are taking place. The paper analyses the implications of splitting long-term network planning activity from the organization responsible for short-term network operation activities. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed framework includes an analysis of impacts of external forces, set-up of common targets and performance models, and alignment of responsibilities in the new organization. The empirical results and validation of the proposed framework is performed by an electric utility, where legal unbundling of activities has taken place; the study includes expert interviews and theoretical analysis. Findings - Colliding interests in the new business model can be avoided if economic and technical targets are mainly set by the regulator for both network development and operation activities. Research limitations/implications - The results are based on internal re-organization; a complementary study on re-organizing network business activities to an external service provider could give information about the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications - Application of the proposed framework for decision-making and lessons learned can support electric utilities when planning for unbundling and strategic target-setting in the unbundled business model. Originality/value - The study presents experiences of re-organized network business activities in a pioneering market area with a long experience of outsourcing. The detailed analysis of internal re-organization within one electric utility can facilitate further restructuring phases.

J	McCray, J; Palmer, A				McCray, Janet; Palmer, Adam			Developing a work-based leadership programme in the UK social care sector	JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE LEARNING			English	Article						Action research; Action learning; Workplace learning; Social care; Leadership; England		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a case study of the application of action research in the design of a degree-level leadership skills programme in the English social care sector. Design/methodology/approach - The action research study involved four formal semi-structured interviews with strategic leaders in the social care sector and three focus groups with managers. The paper captures some of the reflections of university lecturers who are both researchers and collaborative partners in the project in its early stages. Findings - The findings demonstrate consensus in the sector at regional strategic and organisational level about leadership skills required for future service models. Research limitations/implications - The sample remains small; however, the findings may have relevance for leadership development planning for social care in other regions of England, as the personalised care agenda gains momentum and services need to realign. Service users were not part of the focus groups and future activity that builds on this preliminary study may need to redress this. The implications of the research are that it offers a model of collaboration between a university and the workplace to support change through learning. Practical implications - There is potential for a sector or an organisation to access management development accredited by a university that meets its needs, is focused, relevant and provides a model for continuing learning beyond the programme. Originality/value - The paper brings together a range of well-established concepts in action research, reflective practice and learning to help deliver change through collaboration. It explores the new demands being placed on care leaders in the independent social care sector when many international governments are facing fiscal challenges which may require care sector reform.

Discrete Events Simulation Model Applied to Large-Scale Hydro-Systems	JOURNAL OF THE SERBIAN SOCIETY FOR COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS			English	Article						Simulation; modeling; discrete event; hydro-system		This paper presents the principles of simulation model developed with DEVS formalism for large-scale hydro-systems management and planning. This simulation model, being DEVS-based, is natively object-oriented, open for communication with other models and is suitable for parallel execution in multiprocessor and distributed environments. It is designed as a part of the hydro-information system, whose strategic objective is to create environment for the optimum management of water resources and to address and resolve the existing and potential conflicts of interest in the region, related to multi-purpose use of water, and the misalignment of interests of the various stakeholders in the river basin. The functional objective of the simulation model is to support water management decision-making (i.e. to aid users in the assessment of the consequences of various management scenarios and to support planning within various hydrologic, climatic, economic, regulatory and political constraints). The combined use of the rainfall/runoff model and DEVS-based simulation for system elements represents a new approach when it comes to water and hydropower management. The model and simulation core make a solid base for the application of optimization algorithms, in order to provide more automated decision support system. A case study of River Drina Basin simulation model, named "Drina" Hydro-Information System is also presented.

J	Mitlacher, LW; Paul, C				Mitlacher, Lars W.; Paul, Christopher			Performance-based pay systems for teams: explaining the design of performance-based pay systems for teams from an expanded agency theory perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						agency theory; pay for performance; teams; pay systems; motivational theories; team success	INCENTIVES; COMPENSATION; MANAGEMENT; SATISFACTION; ANTECEDENTS; MOTIVATION; FAIRNESS; BEHAVIOR; PRODUCT; COSTS	The implementation of teamwork has been growing steadily in the last decade. Companies suppose that the use of teams improves their performance and supports the achievement of their strategic goals. The high relevance of teams in the business world is reflected by an increasing literature on teamwork, team success and the management of teams. One central question concerning the management of teams is the design of pay systems, especially of performance-based pay systems for teams. This aspect has not yet been fully explored in the literature with regard to the agency problems that are associated with managing teams and teamwork. This paper aims to close that gap by exploring how performance-based pay systems for teams should be designed from an expanded agency theory perspective with regard to possibly arising agency problems.

J	Park, IS; Kim, DS				Park, In-Sook; Kim, Deng Sup			Current Drug Regulatory Status of Advanced Drug Evaluation System in Korea	DRUG INFORMATION JOURNAL			English	Article						Korea; KFDA; Drug approval; GRP; CTD; GMP; IND		The pharmaceutical industry is a high-risk and high value-added industry, because the risk of failure in research and development is considerable. However, successful development will allow a company to et high returns. The market scale of the pharmaceutical industry has been increasing in the world and the Korean market is changing to focus on quality of life drugs owing to people's increased income levels and changing lifestyles. Drug products are important for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases, and the development of drug products has resulted in improved quality of life, health maintenance, and considerable benefits to individuals as well as the national economy. However, since drug products cony the risks of adverse reactions, they have to satisfy the two important criteria of safely and efficacy. Therefore, the Korean government has implemented a drug safety management system, including one for authorization of drug products. Recently, one of the most. important issues in the Korean pharmaceutical industry has been the signing of the Korea-US FTA (Free Trade Agreement), which will promote rapid and widespread competition. The pharmaceutical industry will also face the challenges of a more competitive environment. For sustainable growth and development of the Korean pharmaceutical industry in this rapidly changing environment, the balanced harmonization of the industry's strategic R&D efforts and the government's positive policies is essential.

Manufacturing Strategy and Improvement Activities of Sri Lankan Furniture Manufacturers	ENGINEER-JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTION OF ENGINEERS SRI LANKA			English	Article						Manufacturing Strategy; Improvement Activities; Furniture Industry		Furniture industry is a significant industry in the manufacturing sector in Sri Lanka based on the number of employees. This paper studies the manufacturing strategy of Sri Lankan furniture industry. A questionnaire survey was carried out among the key players of the industry to investigate the manufacturing strategy and improvement activities. Cluster analysis is used to identify the strategic manufacturing groups based on their competitive priorities and three strategic groups were formed. Top competitive priorities of the Sri Lankan furniture manufacturers were identified as low price, conformance quality and product performance. Performance improvement activities under three major categories namely advanced manufacturing technologies, integrated information systems and advanced management systems were investigated. Manufacturing strategy stages of the furniture manufacturers were studied based on the Hayes and Wheelwright model and it is found out that majority of the companies have the characteristics of stage II of the model.

J	Perera, HSC				Perera, H. S. C.			Evaluation Model for Selection of Advanced Manufacturing Technologies	ENGINEER-JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTION OF ENGINEERS SRI LANKA			English	Article						Advanced Manufacturing Technology; Analytic Hierarchy Process; Selection of AMT		Implementation of Advanced Manufacturing Technologies (AMT) has become a popular strategy among many industries to face the growing competition. Selection of AMT purely based on economic benefits has been challenged due to other factors such as strategic benefits. This paper presents decision making framework for selection of AMT. Factors influenced on Advanced Manufacturing Technology selection were identified under three categories, economic indicators, strategic benefits and risk. Sub-criteria of each category were further identified. Selection of the best AMT led to a multi-criteria decision making problem as alternative technologies should be evaluated based on many criteria. An Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model was developed for ranking the alternative AMTs. An example of a case is presented to show the actual implementation of the AHP model.	[Perera, H. S.

The goal would be the one of concentrating efforts in the consolidation of the strategic and programmatic actions of the Coastal Management elaborated with the authentic participation of the society. It would be available in beginning, conditions to put in practice the plans and programs of integrated coastal management tend in view the contention of the destructive dynamics in course as well as the promotion of a really anticipative-preventive management style from now on. It is intended like this to organize and to coordinate a net of technician-scientific that support the Federal Public Ministery, in order to promote an democratic-participative administration style related to the appropriation of the existent environmental resources in the coastal area and the consequent invigoration of the environmental citizenship, especially in the coastal area of Santa Catarina State. In this sense it were collected and organized information on the problems and social and environmental conflicts, besides experiences well happened of integrated and participative management of environmental resources in the coastal area of Santa Catarina with the purpose of preparing half-yearly and annual reports and at the same time to strengthen an institutional and academically net of research.

J	Robinson, D				Robinson, David			Strategic planning for biodiversity in New South Wales	ENVIRONMENTAL AND PLANNING LAW JOURNAL			English	Article								Development and growth, not biodiversity conservation, prevail in land-use zoning in New South Wales, including under biodiversity offsetting schemes. Biodiversity offsetting seeks to compensate biodiversity loss from land development by protecting off-site biodiversity. It is central to the biodiversity certification of environmental planning instruments and biodiversity banking, under reforms made to the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 (NSW) in 2004 and 2006 respectively. In this article offsetting is critiqued. First, it is suggested that a more accurate description of the effect of successful offsetting is improve the biodiversity management of an ever-diminishing stock of remnant vegetation rather than overall maintenance of improvement of biodiversity values. Secondly, it is argued that reasonable (as distinct from cost effective) measures be required to avoid on-site loss of biodiversity, before allowing offsets. Thirdly, the adequacy of review mechanisms under biocertification is questioned, and the perverse incentive for developers to shut eyes to biodiversity within a biocertified area is identified. Offsetting, while innovative in its technical aspects, is a limited, economic rationalist response to the core development/environment dilemma. It does not help to do what is also needed, namely to better establish or entrench society's values with respect to biodiversity. To this end, seven strategic planning recommendations are advocated, including two that expand the responsibility of landowners to manage biodiversity.

But the value of strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&As)-as opposed to financial ones-dropped only 33 percent, while the number of deals rose 8 percent. Will strategic mergers withstand our economic downturn much better?

The goal of the business demonstrators is to prove the viability and validity of the TENCompetence domain model and the software infrastructure through real-life implementations in business companies, focussing on the implementation of life-long competence development support in the company. The reported work is taking place at EPIQ Electronic Assembly, Botevgrad, Bulgaria, from 01 November 2008 until 30 June 2009. The specific aim of this business demonstrator is to develop a pilot implementation of the innovative TENCompetence organisational and technological infrastructure to support top and middle management, various professional communities and individuals for improving the processes of competence management, organisational learning and knowledge management in an enterprise context. The business demonstrator's design considers the company strategic plans and available HR management information (job description, training programmes, etc.). The paper examines the value of the TENCompetence model and framework for the description of competence profiles identified in the company, how they are used for developing a competence catalogue in the company and for the implementation of lifelong competence development inside the company.

J	Too, L; Harvey, M				Too, Linda; Harvey, Michael			Accommodating "accelerating" time: the use of timescapes in corporate real estate strategies	JOURNAL OF CORPORATE REAL ESTATE			English	Article						Time-based management; Real estate; Corporate strategy	DYNAMICS; COMPETITION	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of timescape and examine its impact on corporate real estate strategy, i.e. the people, process, space and technology elements of strategy. Design/methodology/approach - This paper utilises a qualitative approach to analyse secondary data in order to develop a conceptual framework of timescape for corporate real estate strategies. Findings - Time is an integral part of strategic corporate real estate management. There are seven key elements that make up the timescape for corporate real estate strategies. Research limitations/implications - This is a conceptual paper and future empirical research should be conducted to validate the propositions made in this paper. Practical implications - The paper clearly identified the need to incorporate timescape into corporate real strategy formulation. The discussion on the impact of timescape on corporate real estate is useful in providing the impetus for managers who operate in a hyper-competitive global business landscape to review their existing strategies. Originality/value - This paper is high in originality as it pioneers the concept of timescape for application within corporate real estate management.

J	Van Lill, D				Van Lill, Daneel			SERVICE DIFFERENTIATION THROUGH TEACHING AND LEARNING: THE CASE OF SUN INTERNATIONAL'S GAMING AND CASINO DIVISION	JOURNAL FOR NEW GENERATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Tourism; Casino; Transformation; Service Differentiation; Management Development		This paper examines the transformation of the South African casino sector prompted by South Africa's democratic dispensation in 1994 and the promulgation of the National GamblingAct (33 of 1996). These developments brought casino gaming into a highly competitive market with service differentiation as a key strategic theme. Sun International's gaming and casino division addressed this challenge by introducing a Gaming Management Development Programme. This innovation was centred on the application of action learning, systems thinking and competency modelling. The result is a 22-module learning programme focusing on casino specific business innovation, systems thinking and leader development. The study captures the three phases in the development and delivery of the programme from 2004 to 2007: i) the design of the Gaming Management Development Programme; ii) promoting and measuring transformational progress through a module on transformational leader development; and iii) a review of progress over three years. The results confirm that the Gaming Management Development Programme has advanced organisational development. Examination of the change dynamic revealed the adaptation of leader and employee mindset as the most difficult gap to overcome in organisational transformation. Furthermore, that the programme was sustained over the long term through top management support, theoretical grounding and by accommodating both business innovation and personal development. Finally, that short term programme success depends on recruiting appropriate participants, formalised mentorship and employing a combination of university and industry course facilitators.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to qualitatively evaluate a methodology for assessing the strategic alignment of a recruitment function. Persons working in the recruitment best practice community of a mining company were targeted as the case study for this research. Individual (one-on-one) and focus group interviews were conducted to elicit the research data. Thematic coding was used to identify the emerging themes from the research data. The findings indicated that this methodology can be used effectively to determine the alignment of the recruitment function with the strategic objectives of the company. However, the bottom line contribution is still unclear.

J	Webb, R				Webb, Rachael			Victoria's Native Vegetation Framework - achieving net gain at the urban growth boundary?	ENVIRONMENTAL AND PLANNING LAW JOURNAL			English	Article								This article reviews the regulation of native vegetation clearance on residential land within the urban growth boundary of Greater Metropolitan Melbourne under Victoria's Native Vegetation Management -A Framework for Action (Native Vegetation Framework). The ambitious goal of the Native Vegetation Framework, which is incorporated into the Victoria Planning Provisions (VPPs) made under the Planning and Environment Act 1987 (Vic), is to achieve a net gain in the extent and quality of native vegetation across the entire landscape. Until recently, several exemptions under the VPPs and the application of the Native Vegetation Framework by the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal have arguably facilitated native vegetation removal on residential land. These decisions highlight the inadequacy of managing native vegetation on a site-by-site basis. What is needed is a strategic and regional approach, making better use of native vegetation precinct plans and regional vegetation plans, as well as further consideration of the need for legislative reform.

J	Wehmeyer, K; Kipp, A; Riemer, K				Wehmeyer, Kai; Kipp, Alexander; Riemer, Kai			Managing the process of channel alignment Model-driven strategy development in a multinational corporation	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Supply chain management; Strategic alignment; Strategic management		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework and a reference process for achieving channel alignment in companies that use traditional and electronic marketing channels. Instruments for gathering and structuring of information on channel deployment are proposed and integrated in the process of strategy formulation. Design/methodology/approach - The research grounds on a conceptual model of strategic channel alignment (MSCA) that is a recently proposed modification of the well-established strategic alignment model (SAM). Framework, instruments, and reference process were developed by drawing on results from literature analysis and experiences gathered in a research and consulting project at a large multinational corporation. The case context is explicated. Findings - The developed management tools were successfully applied in strategic business units of the case company. They were found to be useful for facilitating strategic channel alignment by fostering processes of communication and collaboration between managers across organizational units. The framework helps to implement a common "strategy language" on multi channel management. The instruments support the creation of a shared information base on a company's multi channel strategy and operations. Research limitations/implications - The paper contributes to research on strategic alignment processes and discusses model-driven alignment as social process that aims at the construction of a common understanding of multi channel issues. The beneficial role of management tools in such processes is spelled out. Practical implications - The generic nature of the proposed management tools makes further practical applications possible. Companies that strategically address the alignment of their marketing channels can utilize the methodology and adapt it to their specific needs. Originality/value - The paper translates a conceptual management model into a practical methodology. Models like the SAM and the MSCA are frequently discussed but research and reports on their practical value has been scarce. This paper contributes to filling this gap and develops tools of practical value in a particular domain of strategic management.

J	Wu, CS; Liu, SH; Chen, CL				Wu, Ching-Sung; Liu, Su-Houn; Chen, Chun-Liang			The asymmetries in strategic alliances of MNEs subsidiaries in Taiwan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						alliance asymmetries; e-business; HP; IBM; strategic alliances	MEDIUM ENTERPRISES; JOINT VENTURES; TECHNOLOGY; PARTNERS; COOPERATION; NETWORKS; SUCCESS; MARKET; FIRMS; US	Strategic alliances play a critical role in the business of Multinational Enterprises (MNEs), such as HP and IBM, which are under pressure because of ongoing e-business transformation. This study explores the phenomenon of strategy differences in allying with Taiwan local companies between two e-business MNEs, IBM and HP, subsidiaries under technological changes and globalisation. We find that, even though the subsidiaries have followed the e-business strategies inherited from their parent companies in some ways, the motivations for IBM Taiwan and HP Taiwan to ally with local firms are consistent with Dunning's reappraised eclectic paradigm. Our findings also indicate that these two MNEs Subsidiaries ally asymmetrically with local firms by using non-equity alliances. In addition, we find that Taiwanese partner firms have a particular interest in forming scale (horizontal) alliances with e-business MNEs. Specifically, this study extends the explanations and implications of the Familiarity Matrix, links it to the OLI model and explores the role of technology in MNEs international strategic alliance activities.

J	Yan, RL				Yan, Ruiliang			Pricing strategies and firm performances under alliance brand	JOURNAL OF PRODUCT AND BRAND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Pricing policy; Brand management; Strategic alliances; Game theory; Market research		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework to help competitive firms find optimal pricing and brand management strategies in order to maximize their respective profits. Design/methodology/approach - A game-theoretic model is developed to determine optimal pricing and brand management strategies for competitive firms. Findings - The study demonstrates that optimal pricing and brand management strategies exist for firms in a competitive market. The optimum marketing strategy for competitive firms to employ is the cooperative alliance pricing and brand management strategy, particularly when market competition is very intense. Research limitations/implications - The present study assumes that all information is known to all parties. However, information could be incomplete. It is recommended that future research explore pricing and brand management strategies under incomplete and asymmetric information settings. Practical implications - The paper provides a very useful model framework and pricing and brand management strategy for business managers when they are doing business in a competitive market. Originality/value - The paper fills a conceptual and practical gap for a structured analysis of the current state of knowledge about alliance brand. It provides practical and solid advice and examples demonstrating the application of cooperative alliance pricing and brand management strategies for business managers.

J	Yenmez, N				Yenmez, Neceti			The importance Of Boron Minerals In Turkey As A Strategic Mine	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-COGRAFYA DERGISI			Turkish	Article						Boron reserves; strategic mine; special boron product; boron enterprises		This study contains the importance of boron minerals in Turkiye as a strategic mine. The most important boron reserves in the world are in Turkiye. The other main reserves are in the USA and Russia. Total world boron reserves on the basis of B2O3 content are 369 million tones proven (807 million tones probable and possible, with a total of 1. 176 million tons) Turkiye's share of these reserves is %72,3 while the percentages are 6,8 and 8,5 for the USA and Russia respectively. The life span of Turkiye's boron reserves is 567 years, whereas in Russia as second richest country with the reserves, it is 67 years. Turkiye's main economical boron minerals are Tincal, Colemanite and Uleksit. Turkiye is the leading country of the world regarding the boron reserves that it has and their quality of substance. Although the boron minerals are used as raw materials in many applications, they are mostly used in various areas after being converted to rafined boron compounds and to special boron deriatives. Boron minerals have an intensive and increasing usage from glass to detergent industry and in metallurgical, agricultural and nuclear applications. Due to these features, boron mine is of great importance for Turkiye. Our country is the biggest exporter in the world by possesing % 72 of all boron reserves. The mining, production and marketing rights of boron minerals Turkiye is given by law to Eti Mine Works General Management. Eti Mine Works produces colemanite, ulexite and tincal concentrates as well as rafinery products and supplies those to the world market. The institution has applied a series of investments in boron sector to improve further its contribution to the country's economy and aims at improving its competitiveness in the sector. At the present day, boron is an important and strategic mineral that is possessed by Turkiye which will also have a significant role in the country's future in this study, boron mine is evaluated as it has such importance, and its significance for the national economy as well as the country's future is emphasised.				necati_yenmez@hotmail.com					[Anonymous], 2005, MINERAL COMMODITY SU; [Anonymous], 2000, MINERAL COMMODITY SU; [Anonymous], 2006, MINERAL COMMODITY SU; [Anonymous], 2003, MINERAL COMMODITY SU; [Anonymous], 2002, MINERAL COMMODITY SU; [Anonymous], 2005, YILLIK FAALIYET RAPO; [Anonymous], 2007, YILLIK FAALIYET RAPO; [Anonymous], 2006, YILLIK FAALIYET RAPO; [Anonymous], 2002, BILIM VE TEKNIK  MAY; ATO, 2007, BOR VE OT RAP; [BOREN BOREN Ulusal Bor AraGtirma Enstitusu], 2007, STRAT PLAN 2008 2012; CALIK A, 2002, MUHENDIS VE MAKINE D, V508, P1; CETIN H, 2005, BOR KAPANI; DOGANAY H, 1995, TURKIYE EKONOMIK COG, V6; *DPT, 2001, MAD OZ IHT KOM RAP; IPEKOGLU U, 1987, MADENCILIK DERGISI, V1, P5; ITO, 2006, BOR SEKT PROF RAP; KALAFATOGLU G.

In the non-profit sector education and training have been realised for leaders in non-governmental, faith and charity organisations as well as in public, educational and social care institutions. As well as many informal additional forms of education (improvement, advanced training, work on oneself) much education has been provided by non-profit organisations, for example the Open Society. Croatia defines education as a strategic goal. Inside the educational system research and experience show the importance of management and leadership in educational institutions as well as in the social care system. We are of the opinion that lack of knowledge and skills adds up to poverty. It makes sense that increasing the quality of leadership in the educational system should be one of the first strategic points for development. An improvement in the quality of management is dependent on the efficiency and the effectiveness of the educational system. Caritas Croatia, through a new mission in cooperation and partnership with Caritas Germany, Deutscher Caritasverband and the German government, has established a formal educational system for leadership in non-profit organisations through postgraduate study: Management for Non-profit Organisations and Social Advocacy. Education is a part of the non-profit sector described in diagrams. Education basically rests on non-profit governmental institutions (institutions for education, schools), but educational suppliers are both profit and non-profit organisations. Research was conducted in order to find the answers to omit open questions about leaders' educational needs and the key of quality in the educational system as well as in the whole non-profit sector.

J	Heller, W				Heller, W.			Second Strategic Energy Report of the European Union - More Security of Supply with Nuclear Power	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article								On November 13, 2008, the EU Commission presented the Second Strategic Energy Report. The Report was supplemented by one proposed directive each on the security of gas supply and on oil stockpiling, by a Multitude of measures to improve energy efficiency, and by 2 communications by the Commission on offshore wind energy and the nuclear program of the EU. The Commission attaches strategic importance in securing energy supply to the domestic energy resources, renewables, coal, and nuclear power. Moreover, the Commission assigns to the use of nuclear power an important role in the transition to an economy causing only a minimum of CO(2) emissions. The updated nuclear program contains these proposals: - The Most up-to-date technology is to be employed in the construction of new reactors, and - the highest standards of nuclear safety are to be applied. - The diverse licensing conditions and procedures currently existing in the member states are to be harmonized. A few days earlier, the Nuclear Energy, Agency (NEA) of OECD had presented the 2008 Nuclear Energy Outlook in which the points raised by the EU Commission are Outlined in the same sense for the OECD member countries. Germany clearly continues to be in an isolated position worldwide in opting out of the use of nuclear power. This raises the question when and in what way political majorities may again be found which would prevent the enforcement of laws in the interest of phasing out nuclear power, and get rid of the irrational blockages in spent fuel and nuclear waste management.										0	0	0	0	5	INFORUM VERLAGS-VERWALTUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH	BERLIN	ROBERT-KOCH-PLATZ 4, BERLIN, 10115, GERMANY	1431-5254			ATW-INT J NUCL POWER	ATW-Int.

J	Rasim, TS				Rasim, Talibova Shelale			The Role of Psychology in Human Resources Management	EUROPES JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						psychology; management; personnel selection; human resources; tests		HRM can be considered to be responsibility of all those who manage people as well as a description of persons who are employed as specialists. It is that part of management that involves planning for human resource needs, including recruitment and selection, training and development. It also includes welfare and safety, wage and salary administration, collective bargaining and dealing with most aspects of industrial relations. The integration between the management of human resources and psychology is arguably the prime factor delineating HRM theory and practice from its more traditional personnel management origins. Selection of the personnel has long been recognized as a key activity within HR and this article seeks to explore the extent to which its practice provides evidence of such strategic alignment.

With the effect of the globalization, existence of the competition in the iformation age has changed the comprehension about the customers and the relationship of the customers. So the new approach must be necessary on the point of view both the management model and the marketing. This article based on the literature research and it searches the relationship between the value-based marketing which focuses on customer's and the shareholder's value and the strategic management system based on measurement which is called Balanced Scorecard (BSC) that explains the strategy and makes the strategy to action. The management model Balanced Scorecard (BSC) has four perspectives which are finance, customer, internal process and learning&growth. Characteristics of the value-based marketing and caracteristics of BSC are in a complete harmony. At that point BSC has a strategic importance for the application of the value-based marketing. Administraters, which want to catch the rivalry superiority at the information age, will use value-based marketing strategy with the BSC management model, which is the management model of information age, effectively.

J	Landi, M; Colucci, D				Landi, Massimiliano; Colucci, Domenico			Rational and boundedly rational behavior in a binary choice sender-receiver game	JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION			English	Article						cheap talk; elections; bounded rationality; terrorism	PLAYERS MODELS; GUESSING GAMES; INFORMATION; COGNITION	The authors investigate the strategic rationale behind the message sent by Osama bin Laden on the eve of the 2004 U. S. Presidential elections. They model this situation as a signaling game in which a population of receivers takes a binary choice, the outcome is decided by majority rule, sender and receivers have conflicting interests, and there is uncertainty about both players' degree of rationality. They characterize the structure of the sequential equilibria of the game as a function of the parameters governing the uncertainty and find that in all pure strategy equilibria, the outcome most preferred by the rational sender is chosen. An explanation of the above-mentioned events relies crucially on the relative likelihood of rational and naive players: If a sufficient departure from full rationality of the electorate is posited, then our model suggests that bin Laden's pre-electoral message succeeded in tilting the race toward his preferred outcome.

To understand the current status of the non-national forest, data was surveyed and analyzed from 14 cities and counties in the Jeonbuk Province. In result, one of the reasons for stagnant non-national forest management is that there was no security of commercial succession in the non-national forest. The key to Successful non-national management is a proper understanding Of public interest of the worth of forests and the new strategy of non-national forests as a tertiary industry because economic management of the forest. is difficult in the current, situation. In addition, investment of non-timber products and launching the support's of non-national forests are required from the local government since The short-term forest, products have a high possibility of success as strategic sources of high income. Jeonbuk Province has to adopt the business items suitable to the actual circumstances and the methods that. call promote management of the non-national forest.

These interventions are reflected through already accepted and suggested legislation. The study is conceived as the qualitative analysis of strategic documents of the Republic of Slovenia (The Development Strategy of Slovenia, The Resolution of National Developmental Projects for the Period 2007-2023, The Frame of Economic and Social Reforms for Increasing the Welfare of Slovenia), which imply planned and already introduced changes. The contents of documents are analysed according to developmental priorities, planned big projects including the area of education, changes in school legislation and according to the anticipated transfer of competence to the lower level of management. Furthermore, they are critically presented with the existing researches, theoretical discussions and findings resulting from the analyses provided by marketized school policies in other countries. In the concluding discussion, there are findings about interventions and influences of the suggested regional and other legislation in secondary school education, which, adapting to the regional and the economic needs, can become an economic sub-system with the domination of market economy and capital power.

J	Misra, RB				Misra, Ram B.			The Use of Outsourcing as a Business Strategy: A Case Study	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						business strategy; case study; outsourcing		In this chapter, we discuss how a leading telecommunications software development company went about outsourcing some phases of the system development life cycle (SDLC) of network management systems in order to achieve both the short-term tactical goals as well as the longterm strategic goals. We present a framework consisting of seven factors that should be used by companies using outsourcing as a business strategy. This framework was used to analyze the outsourcing practices used by this company. The framework includes the driving forces for offshore outsourcing, the selection process of outsourcing vendors and the infrastructure (communication links, hardware, software, and organizational structure) that was needed to insure that the outsourced work meets company's internal quality requirements, which are derived from CMM5 and ISO9001 certifications. We also present the challenges of making these things happen, what worked well, and the lessons learned.

J	Alsewailem, FD				Alsewailem, Fares D.			Post-Consumer Plastics in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia	ARAB GULF JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH			Arabic	Article						PS; PET; HDPE; crushing; plastic wastes; treatment; Saudi Arabia	WASTE MANAGEMENT; SCHEMES	This paper presents data on plastic waste management and treatment at the residential compound of King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) in Riyadh. Twenty waste containers with a capacity of 240 Liters were distributed at some strategic locations at residential compound such as the central market, mosques, and boys and girls schools to collect the plastic waste. The residents were also given a choice to have their plastic wastes ready in front of their houses to be collected on Sunday and Thursday every week. After collecting all plastic wastes, which lasted from 9 to 12 months, materials were subjected to sorting based on type. This was followed by a step of size reduction by means of crushing in order to easily measure the amounts of materials collected and sorted. The results of this study indicated that most of the plastic wastes found at KACST's residential compound were of type two (High Density Polyethylene, HDPE) at 61% weight, while type one (Polyethyleneterephthalate, PET) came in second place at 34% weight. Type six (Polystyrene, PS) was found at smaller quantities, due to its rare use as a household item. The total amount of plastic wastes collected, which was at 287 kg, formed only 0.24% of the expected plastic wastes in KACST's residential compound according to the governmental statistics, and 1.15% of the expected rate for plastic food packaging waste in the compound based on the analysis of the current study. The explanation given for not matching the above expected rates for plastic waste production in the residential compound was attributed to the fact that 60% of the residents did not participate in the process of sorting and collection of waste reclamation.

Genome-wide search for QTLs for apolipoprotein A-I level in elderly Swedish DZ twins: evidence of female-specific locus on 15q11-13	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article						apolipoprotein A-I; quantitative trait loci; genome-wide scan; linkage; atherosclerosis	CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL; QUANTITATIVE-TRAIT LOCI; SERUM-LIPID LEVELS; LINKAGE ANALYSIS; HDL-CHOLESTEROL; ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES; 2 GENES; CHROMOSOME; ATHEROSCLEROSIS	The effect of genetic variants underlying atherosclerosis is thought to be mediated through intermediate phenotypes such as serum cholesterol levels. Localization of quantitative trait loci influencing levels of serum lipids and (apo) lipoproteins may aid in the search for determinants of susceptibility to atherosclerotic diseases. Since apolipoprotein A-I is the primary protein constituent of high-density lipoprotein, it is considered to be critical for the antiatherogenic effect of high-density lipoproteins. We describe here an effort to map loci influencing apolipoprotein A-I levels. Measurements of apolipoprotein A-I levels and genome scans with more than 1000 microsatellite markers were successfully performed in both members of 501 pairs of fraternal twins from Sweden. Variance component linkage analysis was undertaken to map quantitative trait loci. In the total study sample, two loci showed comparable suggestive evidence of linkage, 6p21-12 (LOD 2.4) and 12q23 (LOD 2.4). Sex-limited analyses revealed significant female-specific linkage at marker D15S156 on 15q11-13 (LOD 4.1). The loci on 12q and 15q in the present study confirm previously reported loci for apolipoprotein A-I, while the peak on chromosome 6p lends further support to a locus influencing several phenotypes related to atherosclerosis. Intriguingly, the presence of genes belonging to the phospholipase A2 superfamily under three out of four observed linkage peaks would lend some support to the view that this group of genes might collectively represent candidates as apolipoprotein A-I level regulators.

J	Ott, S				Ott, Sandra			Denunciations, clemency and conflict resolution in the French Basque Country (1917-1944)	JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES			English	Article						communists; French Basques; occupation; Vichy		During the interwar years, under Vichy rule and German occupation, French Basques upheld a longstanding right to judge their fellow citizens and to address wrongdoing that threatened stability and order in their conservative, Catholic moral community. In the province of Xiberoa, that dual community-based right underpinned the wish of Xiberoans to manage their own justice and intra-community conflicts, in certain circumstances, without intervention from the state and its representatives. This article examines cases when local holders of civic and moral authority chose, or were forced, to seek legal justice and to resolve conflict through authorities external to their moral community. The small, industrial town of Maule provides a local focus for exploring the management of justice and intra-community conflict by Basque notables, who made strategic use of information about wrongdoing to protect their moral community from internal and external harm, embodied by the communists in their midst.

AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL			English	Article						climate change; corporate response; stakeholders; perception; environmental accounting; India	MANAGEMENT; POLICY; GREEN	This paper examines different perceptions on climate change management and disclosures from the viewpoint of stakeholders in Indian Corporations. The paper shows how climate change strategies and disclosures at different organizational levels can be linked to the societal and competitive contexts that companies face, embedded in a stakeholder view. Companies are divided according to certain attributes-location, geographical spread, industry, degree of vertical integration and diversification, companies prioritizing particular stakeholder groups, and their climate change strategies and disclosures including internal measures, supply-chain measures and/or market-based measures that move beyond the supply chain are analyzed. This paper attempts to illustrate how institutional, resource-based, supply chain and stakeholder views are all important to characterize and understand corporate strategic responses to a sustainability issue.

Rapid audit of information and communications technology	BT TECHNOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article								Most enterprises lack an accurate understanding of their network, IT, and application infrastructure, and the impact that the infrastructure has on their business processes. This complicates normal functions such as asset management and cost assignment. Moreover, strategic initiatives such as IT consolidation or ICT outsourcing are significantly hindered, as it may not be possible to communicate an accurate picture of the current infrastructure. Comprehensive 'ICT audit' systems, which automatically detect infrastructure, applications, and in some cases the relationships to business process, may provide the answer. This paper explores the ICT audit area, first by proposing an overall framework for understanding the different types of discovery systems, then by looking at the methodology for an ICT audit practice. The paper also presents the findings of recent tests at BT's Adastral Park technology centre, showing the limits of what can be achieved with the tools available on the marketplace today. The paper closes by suggesting a roadmap of discovery technologies which go beyond the capabilities of current tools into new areas that are already being developed and tested at Adastral Park.

Many utilities are facing tremendous difficulty in recruiting and hiring qualified employees. They also may find it difficult to retain good employees whose knowledge and skills are in demand in this growing employee's market. Utilities have been using dated recruiting methods resulting from the recent era of lean operations and hiring freezes. Utility culture has not changed to meet the critical job factors sought by younger generations. This article provides solutions to workforce sustainability issues that utility managers can adopt and implement in their organizations with minimal financial investment. Employers must provide the same level of attention to workforce planning as they do to asset management and other strategic business priorities. Examples of successful application of workforce planning practices by specific utilities are shared to illustrate proven effectiveness and open the door for collaboration. Other resources to assist utilities are also given.

In the last years, it became an integral part of the organizational strategy, seeking the increase in productivity and competition. The purpose of this survey was to describe how the model of competences management articulates with the strategic guidelines of an organization and contributes to a successful implantation of technological innovations. The chosen enterprise for this survey was a family business. Through the method of qualitative and descriptive case study, ten employees were interviewed, of three hierarchic levels, from administration, products and services. The research proved that knowledge, skills and attitudes were developed to give support to the strategic guidelines and reformulated every two years. For the enterprise, the development of functional competence is a process of collective learning to guaranty the successful implantation of constant technological innovations.

One such business began in 1971 as a single-service trucking company known as O-J Transport. It later expanded its capabilities and diversified its mission to become The O-J Group, a multi-service transportation and logistics enterprise. Strategically seizing opportunities, the CEO in 1998 expanded the company to become a global supplier to the automotive divisions whose mission is to optimize the customer's supply chain infrastructures and processes by designing and implementing complex supply chain solutions and leverag-ing information technology to reduce costs and improve service. This study assesses the diffusion of information technology within the compnay by exploring the evolution of its technological infrastructure using Windley's ( 2002) e-government maturity model to evaluate JGI's adoption of goverment-to-business initiatives.

J	La Rocca, M; La Rocca, T; Gerace, D				La Rocca, M.; La Rocca, T.; Gerace, D.			A survey of the relation between capital structure and corporate strategy	AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL			English	Article						Overinvestment; underinvestment; risk-shifting; capital structure; corporate		This paper responds to the general call for integration between finance and strategy research by examining how financial decisions are related to corporate strategy. In particular, the paper focuses on the link between capital structure and strategy. Corporate strategies complement traditional finance paradigms and extend our insight into a firm's decisions regarding capital structure. Equity and debt must be considered as financial instruments as well as strategic instruments of corporate governance (Williamson 1988). Debt subordinates governance activities to stricter management, while equity allows for greater flexibility and decisionmaking power. The literature on finance and strategy analyzes how the strategic actions of key players (managers, shareholders, debtholders, competitors, workers, suppliers, etc) affect firm value and the allocation of value between claimholders. Specifically, financing decisions can concern value creation process (1) influencing efficient investments decisions according to the existence of conflict of interest between managers and firm's financial stakeholders (shareholders and debtholders) and (2) affecting the relationship with non-financial stakeholders, as suppliers, competitors, customers, etc. To summarize, the potential interaction between managers, financial stakeholders, and nonfinancial stakeholders influences capital structure, corporate governance activities, and value creation processes. These in turn, may give rise to inefficient managerial decisions or they may shape the industry's competitive dynamics to achieve a competitive advantage. A good integration between strategy and finance dimensions can be tantamount to a competitive weapon.

J	Perrott, BE				Perrott, Bruce			Towards a Model of Transformation: Manager's Perceptions of Transformation in an E-business Environment	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"Place" to "Space" transformation; transformation models; transformation process; electronic business; electronic business enablement; electronic business transformation; marketing channel innovation		In the Entrepreneurial Millennium, companies and industries must come to terms with change. When change is radical, they must manage a metamorphosis by way of transformation. Here industry structures and relationships may change radically where new rules and guidelines are needed to manage the business and its customers in the transformed dimension. Some studies have conducted research and analysed findings according to the transformational impact on the organisations showing that early adopters of e- business show a trend towards cost reductions and administrative efficiencies while more mature users focus on strategic level change and advantage (Ash and Burn, 2003). Other researchers have studied the challenges that major organisations have encountered while expanding their ebusiness transformation strategy (Ranganathan, Shetty and Muthukumaran, 2004). Managers therefore need to develop a better understanding of the theory and processes associated with the transformation in an e-business context. This paper reviews the findings of field research and uses it as a basis to propose a new model of transformation which may guide future research and lead to a better understanding of what is involved in the process.

There are, however, marked similarities and shared interests between the fields and, most importantly, basic neuroscience is equally relevant for all clinical problems. The European Brain Council has analysed the burden and the cost of brain disorders in Europe. The aim of the present text is to report data for Slovenia. Twelve different disorders (or groups of disorders) of brain believed to have the highest cost (addiction, affective disorders, anxiety disorders, brain tumours, dementia, epilepsy, migraine and other headaches, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, psychotic disorders, stroke, and trauma) were analysed. Epidemiology data for Europe were collected as 12-month prevalence data for disorders by country and stratified according to age, gender, and disorder severity. Because little original data were available for Slovenia, extrapolated data were used. Health economic data (representing direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs, and indirect costs) being transformed into euros for the year 2004 were entered into a health economic model. The total number of brain disorders in Slovenia amounted to 570,000 in 2004, and when corrected for co-morbidity, 1/5 of the Slovenian population have a brain disorder. In particular, this is 39,000 alcohol dependents and illicit drug dependants, 105.000 affective disorders, 195,000 anxiety disorders, 178,000 migraine, etc. The total cost of all included brain disorders in Slovenia was estimated at 833 million euros, the most costly being affective disorders, dementia, and addiction. It should be mentioned that both the epidemiological data and the resulting cost are significantly underestimated for several disorders, particularly stroke. Direct health care cost mounted to 403 million euros and constituted 48 % of total cost; 6 % of the total cost present drugs for brain disorders. Thus brain disorders in Slovenia constituted 14 % of the total direct health care cost in Slovenia and 9 % of total drug costs. The total cost of brain disorders constituted 2 % of the gross national product of Slovenia. The preparations for this study have revealed an important lack of epidemiological and health economical data of brain disorders in Slovenia which should serve to promote these studies in future. The estimated costs are nevertheless thought to present a relatively good measure of the real picture. The significance of these costs has not really been appreciated so far due to the particularisation of psychiatric, neurological, and neurosurgical disorders into individual compartments. Data should be useful for strategic planning of health care, research, and education.

For a variety of reasons, the pharmaceutical industry has been slow to take advantage of the benefits that offshoring can provide. The purpose of this article is to explore the internal and exogenous factors motivating global pharmaceutical firms to increase and expand their sourcing activities. And, instead of discussing global sourcing in general, India has been analyzed as a unique and explanatory case study for this new, emerging trend. The reasons behind this decision include India's position as a renowned global IT hub, the country's "home grown" biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, the numerous strategic partnerships and offshoring relationships between global and Indian firms, as well as its significant advances in IT and information management.

J	Nguyen, HTT				Nguyen Hai Thi Thanh			STRENGTHENING ICT LEADERSHIP IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES			English	Article						ICT Leadership; Chief Information Offices (CIO); Government Chief Information Offices (GCIO); E-Government; Developing Country; Developed Country	CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER; CONVERGENCE; MANAGEMENT; DIVIDE; IMPACT; CIO	The position of Government Chief Information Officer (GCIO) has been adopted by many developed countries seeking to leverage technology within the management of public administration. The position calls for an operational executive who can make important strategic decisions that impact public agency ICT. However, whereas ICT programs have attracted more attention in developing countries, very little research has been done to define the GCIO's responsibilities and how to increase their contribution to ICT initiatives. In this paper a comparative analysis of developed and developing countries is undertaken in order to identify four major categories of solutions to how the GCIO's leadership in developing countries can be enhanced. The four categories are: formal authority over their resource allocation in relationship to high-level leadership, the competences for cross-boundary leadership, the abilities to sustain support from staff and managers, and the development of the CIO system in the private sector. These findings can give guidance to management and GCIOs to enhance the outcome of their contributions to organizations; and as a result increase efficiency and effectiveness of government ICT projects.

Developing an intranet towards knowledge sharing: a practitioner-based inquiry	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Intranet technology; knowledge; knowledge management; knowledge sharing; practitioner research	MANAGEMENT	The intranet is a common feature in many organizations. With the increasing use of a technology infrastructure in organizations, there is a continued challenge for employees in an organization to contribute their knowledge willingly and to make use of knowledge sharing with other employees. Intranets are well-suited for use as a strategic tool in knowledge sharing due to their ability to support the distribution, connectivity and publishing of data and information. Intranets should be seen as integral to an organization's knowledge management strategy and should be tailored to suit and enhance an organization's knowledge-sharing activities. The question arises: To what extent does an organization's existing intranet facilitate knowledge sharing? From a practitioner-based inquiry perspective, this question was explored by the selection of a large organization - eThekwini Municipality, Durban, South Africa -as the field of application. Derived from a mixed methodology approach, the results of a survey are presented. It is suggested that encouragement be given for more practitioner-based inquiry research.	[Averweg, U.

J	Clement, W				Clement, Wolfgang			Secure energy supply without coal and nuclear power?	ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			German	Article; Proceedings Paper	Winter Meeting of the German Automic Forum	FEB 06-07, 2008	Berlin, GERMANY					The future of energy policy and energy supply is determined by the rising global demand for every kind of energy. Europe is being confronted with an ever growing dependence on imported oil and gas. We thus fall victim to the volatile ups and downs of oil and gas prices on the world markets. These risks to industry, and thus to jobs, are simply underrated, even ignored, in this country. Challenges of this kind require strategic solutions instead of case-by-case decisions which, in addition, more often than not are based on emotion rather than facts. Finding strategic solutions means that we must use all our scientific, technological and industrial potentials to achieve our ambitious goals in climate policy. We must use energy as intelligently as possible, i.e., we must develop and, above all, use CO2-free coal-fired power plants, safe nuclear power, renewable energy sources, and take measures to ensure a highly efficient management of energy. Only this four-pronged approach will enable us to ensure optimally competition, continuity of supply, and protection of the environment and the climate. Those who negate or ignore this interrelation are bound to fail in economic and ecological reality.

Outlines the ALP philosophy, based on a belief in grassroots development, and its grassroots framework, expressed in terms of its Strategic Plan. Since 1991, 181 projects, including inservice trainings, training in ICT and information literacy, and travel grants, have been carried out at a total cost of more than USD 3 million. Projects are initiated from within the developing regions and carried out by professionals in the regions. These activities support the three pillars of IFLA: The Profession; Society; and the Membership. Identifies the characteristics of a good project and briefly describes examples of good training workshop projects on the Preservation of African Photographic Collections, Managing Digital Libraries and Information Literacy. Concludes that ALP is very important to library development and the visibility of IFLA in developing countries, but that the financial support base needs to be broadened.	[Gorman, G.

J	Novakovic, D				Novakovic, Dragan			RELATIONSHIP OF THE ISLAMIC COMMUNITY IN THE SOCIALIST YUGO-SLAVIA TOWARDS THE PUBLISHING ACTIVITY AS A MODERN METHOD OF INFORMATION	POLITICS AND RELIGION JOURNAL			Russian	Article						Islamic Community; state; control; publishing; press; the Koran translations		The analysis concerned indicates that the publication activity deployed by he Islamic Comunity has obtained the remarquable results. They had begun rather modestly and cautiously, under permanent consultations with various state and ideological commissions, to print basic religious literature, caracterised by the oldfashioned subjects and poor graphic presentation. Making use of all the liberal phases of social development of the period conerned, the management of the Islamic Community kept gradually getting out of the control in the publication field of activity. The institutional shaping up of the Nonaligned Nations Movement had controbuted thereto, as well as the changed foreign policy orientation of the country and good relations Yugoslavia had established with the majority of Islamic countries. The personnel educated at the best Islamic Universities, had begun promoting new standards in that field upon their return to the country, characterised by setting deeper Islamic foundations to all the subjects under study, by eff orts to study the actual problems in an inter-disciplinary way, as well as by the modern marketing access thereto, all of the same having for a goal the books to reach the end user -the ordinary believers. Following up this new strategy, the Islamic Comminity within the FRY, becomes marked by the end of this period. by publication of a larger number of the good quality books, which developed, thanks to the renowned authors, the way of presentation of their material, their actuality and modern graphic design, into the irreplaceable material for all the interested to get acquainted with the up-to-date achievements of the Islamic theology and with the attitude of the Islamic scientists concerning various actual problems or the history of this great religion. After having successfully overcome the opposition from the official state authorities and solved certain organisational and proff essional problems, the holy Islamic book of Koran, was translated into the Srbo-Croatian language. Upon publication of the first edition thereof, all state interefrence had ceased, due to the then adopted attitude than the Islamic believers were entitled to their own copy thereof and the Islamic Community, in its capacity of their representative, was entitled to organise both the printing and distribution of the Koran. Translation of the Koran into the Albanian language meant the achievement of a strategic goal in addition to the religious and cultural one, because in such a way the second largest group of the Islamic believers in Europe, had got the possibility to get acquainted with the basic and binding principles of their faith in their mother tongue. A large number of various newspapers and magasines have been started thanks to the great eff orts deployed by all the Islamic Community structures. In time, the editorial offices and journalists they employed, had acquaired the necessary experience, and thanks to the decisions and subsidiaries from the Republican officials and to the activities of the members of the Ulema (Islamic religious institution) at the field, all these newspapers and magasines achieved a high number of copies according to the criteria of that period. By their devoted work within the Djemat (Religious Committee), the immams had succeeded to attain the goals, previously by the supreme bodies within the Islamic Community in Yugoslavia, i. e. that every Muslem house should prosess a copy of an Islamic newspaper. By way of making them reading only this sort of the press, edited by the persons under direct control and influence of the top people from the religious institutions, the conditions had been created to estrange the Islamic believers in a very large measure, from the multinational and multi-religious environment in which they lived.

Will a mere brick-and-mortar organizational Web site guarantee online success? This case presents the experience of the New York Theatre Group (NYTG), a nonprofit performing arts organization, in integrating e-commerce in its business practices. The case begins with a very broad overview of the nonprofit sector, the performing arts industry, its delivery channels, and the theatrical production process in general. Then attention turns to NYTG itself in terms of its history, organizational structure, its market segmentation, market trends, and forecasted growth. The strategic planning at NYTG, and the programs put in place to help it achieve its objectives and mission, are detailed. A survey that maps the demographic attributes of NYTG's patrons and subscribers is discussed. The case concludes with the current e-commerce challenges facing NYTG in particular and the nonprofit performing arts organizations in general.

J	Ajam, T				Ajam, T.			Integrating strategic planning and budgeting: a PFMA perspective	SOUTHERN AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDITING RESEARCH-SAJAAR			English	Article						Integrating planning and budgeting; public expenditure management; budgetary institutions; Public Finance Management Act		This article explores the conceptual tensions and practical hurdles in integrating planning and budgeting in the public sector. It is imperative that budgets be affordable. If budgeting is subordinate to planning, there is a very real danger that budget constraints will be undermined. Allowing budgets to drive plans, however, sets up short-term inertia which favours status quo and impedes transformation. It is clear that in order to realise the benefits of both planning and budgeting, governments will have to maintain separate but aligned processes. This will require acknowledgement of the inherent, structural tensions which exist, and the active pursuit of a dynamic equilibrium where there are distinct but linked planning and budget processes. A number of operational factors impact on the degree to which plans are congruent with budgets in practice: departmental planning and budgeting systems, structures, processes, information flows, organisational culture and leaderships. The paper concludes by looking at empirical evidence from national and provincial departments, which indicates that while there has been significant progress, further work will have to be done to foster further integration between plans and budgets.

J	Brandao, EA				Brandao, Euler Alves			Aesthetics of Marketing	REVISTA GESTAO & TECNOLOGIA-JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY			Portuguese	Article						Aesthetic; Marketing Theory; Marketing strategy; Competitive Advantage		Despite the predominance of perspectives inserted in the functionalist paradigma, fruit of is dominance in social sciences; the constitution of a marketing theory contains, in the recent years, a bigger opening for differentiated approaches, in which the strategic marketing wins a special emphasis. Under a normative vision, strategic marketing prescribes how company strategic decisions should be taken, and, how usefulness should the best results and practices be pursued. In this way, the opening of the occurrence to develop a multidisciplinary movement for new perspectives aiming to obtain more efficacies is encouraged, and in this context arises the debate on aesthetics, a term easily confounded as something secondary and peripheral, because normally not understood in its fullness. This paper presents the analysis of the aesthetical experience, rescuing it from its philosophical origins, and demonstrates its power of strategic contribution to the marketing practice, highlighting it as an element of the judging capacity, being it a powerful tool for obtaining results.

J	Draskovic, M				Draskovic, Mimo			EVOLUTION OF SYSTEMIC LOGISTICS PROVIDERS	MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS			Croatian	Article						Logistics; Integrated Logistics Management; 4PL Concept; External Providers		The functioning of a port and shipping system must be perfect in order to provide a competitive advantage and stable position in maritime market. The importance of logistics in business success of port and shipping organizations in contemporary conditions has become crucial. Due to that fact, more and more efforts are put in the designing of integral logistics systems. Thanks to a complex, systemic and networking approach, logistics today is improving the speed and efficiency of operations and significantly influences cost reduction and therewith fulfills one of the basic strategic functions, anticipating necessary key competences of the firm. It is a resource framework for the overcoming of strategic limitations and a method for the enhancement of the competitive position and all marketing and management functions. In addition to that, the integration of partners requires, by rule, a consistent restructuring of the total chain dedicated to the creation of added value, i.e. reengineering of logistics and production business processes. Flexible and small structural units are created, cooperating among each other in a decentralized manner, retaining their key competences and strategic significance for the integral network dominated by a single leading firm as a center of the system, i.e. focus of the supply chain. The paper analyzes the formation of new logistics and marketing paradigm of the beginning of the new century and millennium, anticipating the overcoming of the traditional 3PL three-party logistics concept and formation of contemporary 4PL concept.

J	Faifua, D; Harding, S				Faifua, Denise; Harding, Sandra			Broader rationalities and alternative forms of organisation Sociological insights into social strategic action	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY			English	Article						Organizational structures; Organizational culture; Socialization; Strategic management		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to argue that the legacy of instrumental rationality has had a profoundly impoverishing effect on rational accounts of organisation, and that even though non-rational accounts move beyond instrumental rationality, they remain tied to economist assumptions. The paper outlines the broader Weber and Habermas's model of rationality, and demonstrates its application. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on verbatim quotes from a sampling of 35 in-depth interviews, the paper reveals the range of very different rationalities expressed in the social relations of work, of four very specific types of organisation: a bureaucracy, an entrepreneurial unit, a producer cooperative and a worker co-operative. Findings - The paper outlines two ideal sets of findings, ideal in the sense that in two of the organisations the rationalities, social relations of work and associated outcomes fit well with the Weber and Habermas model of instrumental strategic action and social strategic action. Research limitations/implications - This study shows the potential for broader rationality as it plays out in the workplace. The notion of workplaces that free workers to contribute in socially strategic ways points to new approaches to management and organisation. Practical implications - The paper offers practical insights into social relations built on co-operation, moral judgement and communication. Originality/value - The power of the idea of broader rationality is that being more rational, i. e. attending to more than a narrow impoverished view, provides the prospect of action advancing the social and the economic in a profound way.

This paper examines the human resource management challenges arising from the global sourcing of talent, commonly called 'offshoring'. It presents analysis and lessons that company managers interested in setting up offshoring will find valuable. Using data gathered from I I companies that have sourced talent in India, the study presents a framework for the drivers of companies' decisions to source talent globally, the configurations of offshore operations that arise from various strategic drivers and the HR implications that companies will, likely, experience by pursuing various strategies and operating structures.

The paper outlines the structural changes in Bulgarian agriculture since 1989 and discusses the product and market orientation of the horticultural farms in the Plovdiv region of Bulgaria. This paper analyses how farm owners /managers with different sized farms evaluated 5 product/market strategic options: 'doing what you currently do but better', 'developing new horticultural products', 'developing new markets', 'developing new agricultural activities' and 'developing new non-agricultural activities'. The owners /managers identified; whether they perceived these options as feasible for their future development, the encouraging/discou raging factors and the outcomes they expected from their implementation. The small-scale farms (less than 2 ha) were mainly subsistence farms that were relying upon the farmer's experience to survive during the transition period. The second type of farm (2-10 ha) was 'transitional' farms and were working under pressure either for survival or expansion under the new EU related conditions. The third type of farm (over 10 ha) was more business orientated, aiming at business viability and trying to respond to the rapidly changing business environment in Bulgaria as they recognised that the EU accession would present new challenges and opportunities for the successful future development of their farm businesses.

Development of opinion-based generic reforestation regimes and their application in vegetation management and water modelling in the Upper and Lower Foothills of Alberta	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE			English	Article						boreal forest; silviculture; herbicide; forestry; regeneration; vegetation management	SITE PREPARATION; BOREAL FOREST; WHITE SPRUCE; MECHANICAL SITE; BLACK SPRUCE; REGENERATION; DIVERSITY; FIRE; DISTURBANCES; MICROCLIMATE	The operational forestry practices employed by Millar Western Forest Products Ltd. in the Upper and Lower Foothills of Alberta, Canada integrate a broad range of tools to plan, implement, and manage post-harvest site regeneration of pure and mixedwood boreal forests. Following tree harvesting, mechanical site preparation is often used to improve microsite conditions to promote conifer seedling establishment or natural regeneration. Chemical and mechanical site preparation and stand tending control competing vascular weed species. To meet forest regeneration commitments, incorporating knowledge gained from forestry experimentation, long-term field data and iterative deterministic modelling into modified management approaches is employed to formulate appropriate vegetation management strategies. These strategies consider and balance multiple biodiversity (e. g., habitat supply modelling), physical environmental (e. g., streamflow), and societal (e. g., industrial fibre requirements) needs relative to a regenerated vegetation complex. From this experience and understanding, the Company developed a series of generic establishment regimes (GERs), which prescribe detailed silvicultural activities to achieve site-regenerated vegetation complexes in alignment with higher-level forest management planning. An outcome of the GER formulation was the development of corresponding plant community assembly diagrams (PCADs), which describe vegetation complexity and permit calculation of total biomass relative to the time series of silvicultural activities within each GER. In turn, these allow forest planners to model biological, physical, and societal factors, while taking into consideration specific stand growth trajectories based on impacts of silvicultural activities on vegetation biomass and species composition. The GERs and PCADs help formulate vegetation complexes over time and are used to guide the behaviour of a vegetation growth model used in conjunction with a hydrologic simulation model.

J	Gottschalk, P; Karlsen, JT				Gottschalk, Petter; Karlsen, Jan Terje			How knowledge organisations work: the case of law firms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING			English	Article						knowledge management; knowledge workers; knowledge business; lawyers; partnerships; resource-based theory		Law firms are undergoing significant changes. They are emerging as knowledge organisations in the legal knowledge business. Knowledge is their strategic resource that must be managed to achieve profitable growth. Since knowledge resides predominantly in the heads of individuals, recruitment and development of lawyers is critical to success in law firms. Based on reviewed literature, this paper conceptualises law firms as knowledge organisations and lawyers as knowledge workers. This research is important, as there is a need to understand knowledge organisations case by case to develop effective and contingent knowledge management strategies.

J	Holt, R; McNulty, T				Holt, Robin; McNulty, Terry			Securing the licence to act: a foundational capability	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Corporate strategy; Company performance; Capital; Oil industry		Purpose - The paper aims to show how resource-based views of the firm inadequately address the strategic importance of acquiring and using symbolic capital within the wider discursive institutional environment. Design/methodology/approach - A single case using publicly available data on the strategic activities of the oil and gas firm BP was constructed. Findings - Combining case data with a review of literature on firm capabilities and organization studies, the paper identifies a previously unacknowledged foundational strategic capability: securing a licence to act. It finds BP strategists understanding this capability as the realization of credibility and authority arising from the conscious and skilled articulation of firm commitments and activities. Originality/value - Generalising from the case, the paper argues for the importance to firm performance of an understanding of how capabilities evolve in relation to the use of symbolic capital within inherently complex institutional environments. This leads beyond a purely economic view of institutional settings to cover market-based political and social interests.

J	Kim, J; Lim, YK; Shim, JD				Kim, Juyoung; Lim, Young Kyun; Shim, Jae Duck			Research Framework for International Franchising	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE			Chinese	Article						International franchising; franchise; international expansion; methodology; research framework		The purpose of this research is to construct research framework fo international franchising based on existing literature and to identify research components in the framework. Franchise can be defined as management styles that allow franchisee use various management assets of franchisor in order to make or sell product or service. It can be divided into product distribution franchise that is designed to sell products and business format franchise that is designed for running it as business whatever its form is. International franchising can be defined as a way of internationalization of franchisor to foreign country by providing its business format or package to franchisee of host country. International franchising is growing fast for last four decades but academic research on this is quite limited. Especially in Korea, research about international franchising is carried out on by case study format with single case or empirical study format with survey based on domestic franchise theory. Therefore, this paper tries to review existing literature on international franchising research, providing research framework, and then stimulating new research on this field. International franchising research components include motives and environmental factors for decision of expanding to international franchising, entrance modes and development plan for international franchising, contracts and management strategy of international franchising, and various performance measures from different perspectives. First, motives of international franchising are fee collection from franchisee. Also it provides easier way to expanding to foreign country. The other motives including increase total sales volume, occupying better strategic position, getting quality resources, and improving efficiency. Environmental factors that facilitating international franchising encompasses economic condition, trend, and legal or political factors in host and/or home countries. In addition, control power and risk management capability of franchisor plays critical role in successful franchising contract. Final decision to enter foreign country via franchising is determined by numerous factors like history, size, growth, competitiveness, management system, bonding capability, industry characteristics of franchisor. After deciding to enter into foreign country, franchisor needs to set entrance modes of international franchising. Within contractual mode, there are master franchising and area developing franchising, licensing, direct franchising, and joint venture. Theories about entrance mode selection contain concepts of efficiency, knowledge-based approach, competence-based approach, agent theory, and governance cost. The next step after entrance decision is operation strategy. Operation strategy starts with selecting a target city and a target country for franchising. In order to finding, screening targets, franchisor needs to collect information about candidates. Critical information includes brand patent, commercial laws, regulations, market conditions, country risk, and industry analysis. After selecting a target city in target country, franchisor needs to select franchisee, in other word, partner. The first important criteria for selecting partners are financial credibility and capability, possession of real estate. And cultural similarity and knowledge about franchisor and/or home country are also recognized as critical criteria. The most important element in operating strategy is legal document between franchisor and franchisee with home and host countries. Terms and conditions in legal documents give objective information about characteristics of franchising agreement for academic research. Legal documents have definitions of terminology, territory and exclusivity, agreement of term, initial fee, continuing fees, clearing currency, and rights about sub-franchising. Also, legal documents could have terms about softer elements like training program and operation manual. And harder elements like law competent court and terms of expiration. Next element in operating strategy is about product and service. Especially for business format franchising, product/service deliverable, benefit communicators, system identifiers (architectural features), and format facilitators are listed for product/service strategic elements. Another important decision on product/service is standardization vs. customization. The rationale behind standardization is cost reduction, efficiency, consistency, image congruence, brand awareness, and competitiveness on price. Also standardization enables large scale R&D and innovative change in management style. Another element in operating strategy is control management. The simple way to control franchise contract is relying on legal terms, contractual control system. There are other control systems, administrative control system and ethical control system. Contractual control system is a coercive source of power, but franchisor usually doesn't want to use legal power since it doesn't help to build up positive relationship. Instead, self-regulation is widely used. Administrative control system uses control mechanism from ordinary work relationship. Its main component is supporting activities to franchisee and communication method. For example, franchisor provides advertising, training, manual, and delivery, then franchisee follows franchisor's direction. Another component is building franchisor's brand power. The last research element is performance factor of international franchising. Performance elements can be divided into franchisor's performance and franchisee's performance. The conceptual performance measures of franchisor are simple but not easy to obtain objectively. They are profit, sale, cost, experience, and brand power. The performance measures of franchisee are mostly about benefits of host country. They contain small business development, promotion of employment, introduction of new business model, and level up technology status. There are indirect benefits, like increase of tax, refinement of corporate citizenship, regional economic clustering, and improvement of international balance. In addition to those, host country gets socio-cultural change other than economic effects. It includes demographic change, social trend, customer value change, social communication, and social globalization. Sometimes it is called as westernization or McDonaldization of society. In addition, the paper reviews on theories that have been frequently applied to international franchising research, such as agent theory, resource-based view, transaction cost theory, organizational learning theory, and international expansion theories. Resource based theory is used in strategic decision based on resources, like decision about entrance and cooperation depending on resources of franchisee and franchisor. Transaction cost theory can be applied in determination of mutual trust or satisfaction of franchising players. Agent theory tries to explain strategic decision for reducing problem caused by utilizing agent, for example research on control system in franchising agreements. Organizational Learning theory is relatively new in franchising research. It assumes organization tries to maximize performance and learning of organization. In addition, Internalization theory advocates strategic decision of direct investment for removing inefficiency of market transaction and is applied in research on terms of contract. And oligopolistic competition theory is used to explain various entry modes for international expansion. Competency theory support strategic decision of utilizing key competitive advantage. Furthermore, research methodologies including qualitative and quantitative methodologies are suggested for more rigorous international franchising research. Quantitative research needs more real data other than survey data which is usually respondent's judgment. In order to verify theory more rigorously, research based on real data is essential. However, real quantitative data is quite hard to get. The qualitative research other than single case study is also highly recommended. Since international franchising has limited number of applications, scientific research based on grounded theory and ethnography study can be used. Scientific case study is differentiated with single case study on its data collection method and analysis method. The key concept is triangulation in measurement, logical coding and comparison. Finally, it provides overall research direction for international franchising after summarizing research trend in Korea. International franchising research in Korea has two different types, one is for studying Korean franchisor going overseas and the other is for Korean franchisee of foreign franchisor. Among research on Korean franchisor, two common patterns are observed. First of all, they usually deal with success story of one franchisor. The other common pattern is that they focus on same industry and country. Therefore, international franchise research needs to extend their focus to broader subjects with scientific research methodology as well as development of new theory.

J	Lee, CW				Lee, Cheng-Wen			Market performance and technological knowledge transfer of foreign subsidiaries' network embeddedness in Taiwan's electrical and electronic industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						business networks; market performance; network embeddedness; technological knowledge transfer	MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATION; INTERFIRM RELATIONSHIPS; STRATEGIC NETWORKS; SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; FIRM; ORGANIZATIONS; CAPABILITIES; DETERMINANTS; DIRECTIONS; GOVERNANCE	This paper explores the importance of foreign subsidiaries' network embeddedness as a strategic resource for market performance and technological competence in multinational enterprises. The conceptual framework of this study is made LIP of six components: network formative motivation, external network structure. business embeddedness. technical embeddedness, market performance and technological knowledge transfer. Two different types of network embeddedness - business embeddedness and technological embeddedness - are proposed to have in influence on the subsidiaries market performance as well as on technological knowledge transfer of new products and production processes in the MNE. Using data on 106 Taiwan's electrical and electronic manufacturers gathered from a benchmarking questionnaire. eight hypotheses are tested in a LISREL model analysis, The results reveal that the seven hypotheses are supported, albeit under circumstances in which the relationship between network formative motivation and technical embeddedness is not significant. The study's findings highlight that the foreign subsidiaries external network embeddedness is a determinate factor in enhancing the whole MNE's competitive capacity.

J	Mouchili, IN; Prinsloo, GC				Mouchili, I. N.; Prinsloo, G. C.			THE ROLE OF THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN THE NEW PARTNERSHIP FOR AFRICA'S DEVELOPMENT (NEPAD)	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT			English	Article								For many years Africa has presented a gloomy socio-economic picture. The problems Africa faces are so complex and interlinked that a holistic approach is needed to address the issues. Africa is increasingly being marginalised from world development. It accounts for only about 2% of the world total economic exchanges (UNECA, 2000). The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is an initiative by African leaders to inspire political stability and address shortages in infrastructure, education and health in an attempt to end misery across Africa and launch its sustainable development. Inadequate infrastructure is a critical obstacle to intra-African trade and to the competitiveness of African products in international markets. Transport can facilitate the flow of people, ideas and technology. Bridging the transport infrastructure gap is therefore an important factor in unlocking the human and economic potential of the continent. NEPAD aims to coordinate and channel regionally fragmented efforts into one core long-term vision for the continent. NEPAD cannot work if there is too much high level strategic regional focus with little involvement of civil society, specific requirements and needs of African countries, and the private sector. It should develop some general high-level objectives and strategies related to transport operations and infrastructure, such as simplifying and harmonising transport regulations, deregulating the air industry and implementing the Yamoussoukro decisions, and focusing investments on transport corridors (road or rail).

EFFICIENCY OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE FEDERAL AGENCY FOR SUBSOIL USE IN THE FORMATION OF THE LICENSING SYSTEM FOR THE USE OF SUBSOIL	JOURNAL OF MINING INSTITUTE			Russian	Article								The review of publications on problems of strategic management has allowed to make a conclusion that efficiency of activity of the state bodies depends not so much on optimization of costs, how many from optimization of managerial processes. There is an objective necessity of transition for new area of management - the management focused on result. The management focused on result, is the control system connecting questions financial, personnel and operational management with expected results, and also achievement of the strategic purposes. It does not mean, that financial parameters become less important, it means, that they are necessary for balancing others - not financial parameters. This principle (the management focused on result) has allowed to broadcast concrete activity and strategy of Federal agency on subsoil use and its territorial bodies on maintenance of the state system of licensing of using with bowels in full enough set of parameters for an estimation of efficiency of this activity which actually forms system of the strategic control and management.

J	Ornetzeder, M; Suschek-Berger, J				Ornetzeder, Michael; Suschek-Berger, Juergen			Innovation networks in the refurbishment sector of Austria: promising approaches waiting for market success	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						sustainable refurbishment; innovation networks; management of; networks; evaluation		In Austria, the highest potential for sustainable refurbishment is within the sector of single-family houses, which were built between 1945 and 1980. According to estimates, two-thirds of all the possible investments can be assigned to this category. However, there are only a few ambitious models on the supply side, which combine the efficient information and mobilisation of users with a comprehensive technical and ecological offer. Two of these rare examples will be discussed in this paper. Both models have been operating at a local level for the promotion of sustainable refurbishment for several years. The studied examples are characterised by network structures that are constituted by heterogeneous local social players who aim at quality assurance to enable attractive offers for homeowners. Centrally coordinated units manage both network models. In addition to the management of networks, these units try to fulfil several other functions: public relations, training seminars, strategic development, advisory services for end users and the implementation of refurbishment measures. Based on a comprehensive analysis and documentation of both models, we will present a critical evaluation of the network activities. It becomes clear that both examples face two major challenges: internally, to cover and productively manage a wide range of different functions in order to stimulate necessary innovations and externally, to influence the sociopolitical framework conditions to increase the demand for noticeable sustainable refurbishment.

AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL			English	Article						climate change; corporate response; stakeholders; perception; environmental accounting; India	MANAGEMENT; POLICY; GREEN	This paper examines different perceptions on climate change management and disclosures from the viewpoint of stakeholders in Indian Corporations. The paper shows how climate change strategies and disclosures at different organizational levels can be linked to the societal and competitive contexts that companies face, embedded in a stakeholder view. Companies are divided according to certain attributes - location, geographical spread, industry, degree of vertical integration and diversification, companies prioritizing particular stakeholder groups, and their climate change strategies and disclosures including internal measures, supply-chain measures and/or market-based measures that move beyond the supply chain are analyzed. This paper attempts to illustrate how institutional, resource-based, supply chain and stakeholder views are all important to characterize and understand corporate strategic responses to a sustainability issue.

J	Puig, GV; Woods, M				Puig, Gonzalo Villalta; Woods, Michael			The constitutionality of national port regulation	AUSTRALIAN LAW JOURNAL			English	Article								The introduction of Infrastructure Australia heralds a new era of federal influence in national infrastructure planning. This article analyses port regulation as it exists at national and international levels and suggests four elements that would constitute the core business of a national port regulator. It argues that, for a national port regulator to be effective, the constitutional obstacles of Australian federalism must be surmounted with a whole of port approach which would ensure that, where the Commonwealth obtains strategic control of a port, clear lines of responsibility will exist between port authorities and the Commonwealth. To achieve effective national port regulation, we propose a system of declared regulated Australian sea ports controlled by an Australian sea port authority, and that the trade and commerce power in s 51(i) of the Constitution be used to establish these statutory bodies. Our proposal does identify several limitations to the operation of statutory bodies under the trade and commerce power. However, we argue that, if used in conjunction with other constitutional provisions, the trade and commerce power would provide a valid foundation for Commonwealth jurisdiction over ports. Once we establish the validity of Commonwealth jurisdiction, we argue that each of the four elements that would constitute the core business of a national port could be implemented and validly regulated by the Commonwealth through our proposed Australian sea port authority. We conclude that national port regulation, if based on a whole of port approach to the management of the four elements of port business, would be constitutional.

This article deals on the relationship with new products under the consumption systems perspective. After an explorative research, students of a MBA program, divided in groups, performed a work involving various products and services consumption under a systemic perspective, collecting data from primary sources including intense interviews. After this preliminary approach, the question of development of new products and services was identified, and next, the orientation about marketing for the enterprises manufacturing the selected products. The theme chosen to give an empiric support to this article is related to domestic clothes washing, viewed under its multiple consumption sequences. The results showed that the handling of consumption under a systemic focus might consist in a desirable method for a successful development of new products and an indication for the market orientation adopted by the studied enterprise. One must, however, mind the limitations of this study, being it of an exploratory nature.

An example of a generalised second-order linear differential model is applied to study the dynamic response of a company or industry to an exogenous shock. In most systems, significantly over-damped or under-damped response characteristics are expected. However, strategic management monitoring and control systems can scan for external shocks in order to apply dynamic adaptive controls to optimise the company's response. Mathematical tools are used to predict conditions under which an efficient response to external shocks is expected. It is shown that active strategic management can provide superior response characteristics. Additional complementary mathematical modelling approaches are outlined to show how the model may be expanded to address inter-firm linkages, supply chain dynamics, and the propagation of shocks through an industry.

J	Walker, T				Walker, Tim			The applicability of an operations management approach to councils' waste services	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Management theory; Operations management; Performance management		Purpose - This paper arises from a study examining the causality of change by exploring whether best value and performance management had caused change within councils' waste services. The purpose of this paper is to represent one of the unforeseen findings arising from the research programme. Design/methodology/approach - The paper was an exploratory, inductive theory-building study using a practitioner-researcher approach to develop a conceptual model based upon a literature review and a case study research methodology. Findings - The paper finds that, despite much publicity, the cases studied did not use performance management frameworks to structure change and, in this regard, operations management may offer a better approach by which councils could include operational service delivery within the development of corporate strategy. Research limitations/implications - The practitioner-researcher approach provided particular insights to this paper, which may not be apparent otherwise. One of the principal findings was that there appeared to be an absence of coordinated independent research relating to management theory and councils' service delivery, as opposed to private sector applications of theory and practice, which appears unbalanced, especially given that the public sector is one of the largest employers in the UK. Simply transferring private sector performance management approaches without scrutiny and amendment to the different cultural and structural working environment within councils would appear imperfect and likely to create ad hoc success. These findings relate specifically to councils' waste services but may have a relevance outwith these operations. Practical implications - This paper recommended that further research should be conducted to develop a greater understanding of council management practice and how this could be positively affected. Simply recommending the transposition of private sector approaches was unlikely to work and, similarly, the current hands-off approach adopted both between government and councils and between councils' corporate centres and their operational services suggested the emergence of strategic/operational divides. This could be overcome with a more balanced approach and secondments between the different tiers. Originality/value - As practitioner- research, this paper provides an insight into how councils' waste services are prioritizing change, which highlights the emergence of an apparent, growing dislocation between different government tiers. These findings emerge following case study research from a service whose perspectives on management theory rarely get expressed, due to the demands arising from daily operational delivery.

J	Walker, T				Walker, Tim			Some alternative approaches to performance management for councils	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance management; Waste management; Public sector organizations		Purpose - Arising from a study exploring whether best value and performance management had caused change within councils' waste services, this study, having found alternative approaches to those promoted by Government which could warrant further study, sets out to pursue this line of enquiry. Design/methodology/approach - This was an exploratory, inductive theory-building study using a practitioner-researcher approach to develop a conceptual model based upon a literature review and a case study research methodology. Findings - Despite much publicity, the cases studied did not use performance management frameworks to structure change. Several of the cases were aware of the intent of performance management and, in light of those approaches promoted by Government, other systems were considered to be potentially more suitable. Research limitations/implications - The practitioner-researcher approach provided particular insights to this study which may not be apparent otherwise. One of the principal findings was that there appeared to be an absence of coordinated independent research relating to management theory and councils' service delivery, as opposed to private sector applications of theory and practice, which appears unbalanced, especially given that the public sector is one of the largest employers in the UK. In particular, this paper highlights that simply transferring private sector performance management approaches without scrutiny and amendment to the different cultural and structural working environment within councils would appear imperfect and likely to create ad hoc success. These findings relate specifically to councils' waste services but may have a relevance outwith these operations. Practical implications - This study recommended that further research should be conducted to develop a greater understanding of council management practice and examine how this could be positively affected. Simply recommending the transposition of private sector approaches was unlikely to work and, similarly, the current hands-off approach adopted both between Government and councils and between councils' corporate centres and their operational services suggested the emergence of strategic/operational divides.

J	Webb, R				Webb, Rachael			Water management and the coal mining industry in New South Wales	ENVIRONMENTAL AND PLANNING LAW JOURNAL			English	Article								The Water Management Act 2000 (NSW) has brought about major changes in how water is managed in New South Wales for all water users, including the environment. The New South Wales coal mining industry, a high value water user worth $8.5 billion a year, uses water as a fundamental component of its production process. Two of the most significant impacts on water resources from coal mining are salinity and subsidence. These impacts cannot be managed by the Water Management Act alone and this article argues that integrated strategic planning through the range of approvals that a coal mine needs in order to operate lawfully, including planning and environmental impact approval, a mining lease and a licence to discharge water, is essential for the effective management of water resources in New South Wales.

In this case study we focus on the problems that face a CLEC with regard to designing an information system and getting a back office system, called an Operations Support Systems (OSS), operational in a highly competitive, complex, fast-paced market in a compressed time frame when a change in a critical telecommunications network component, namely the central office switch, is made after 75% of the system implementation was completed. This case deals with the factors that led to this change in central office switches, its impact on the IT department, its impact on the company, and the alternatives considered by the IT department as possible solutions to the many problems created by this change.

Industrial holdings now take leading items in oil-and-gas, metallurgical, defensive-industrial, chemical complexes of country, introduce a substantial contribution to formation of a profitable part of all levels budgets. Therefore economic growth and a standard of well-being of the population of country depends on efficiency of their activity in many respects. The questions of effectiveness estimation of industrial holding's activity are considered in the article. The offered algorithm of effectiveness estimation of industrial holding's activity is based on using of multifactorial model of estimation productivity of its branches activity, and the parameters describing the importance of these branches as elements of complex economic system.

J	Yuan, ST				Yuan, Soe-Tsyr			The TradeCard Financial Supply Chain Solution	JOURNAL OF CASES ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						B2B E-commerce; supply chain management; financial services industry; strategic alliances		TradeCard is a US-based online financial supply chain provider, founded in 1997. The online compliance and financial settlement engine was launched in 2000. TradeCard incorporated a number of partners into its service network: financial institutions, credit insurance, inspection and logistics companies. TradeCard quickly grasped market share in footwear and textile industries. TradeCard mainly serves buyers in the US and suppliers in Asia, but is expanding in Europe and transactions are supported worldwide. During the years 2000-2005 TradeCard's business has been growing exponentially. TradeCard platform connects buyers, sellers, and service providers in an online environment, where they can manage the whole documentary process of international trade transaction quickly, visibly, and cost-effectively. In other words, TradeCard is changing the international trade practices. Traditionally companies use banks' services-letter of credit or open account-but TradeCard solution is replacing these services. Although TradeCard is more a substitutor than a complementor to banks' international trade departments, some banks are now trying to use Web-based solutions to gain their customers back. In other words, for survival and growth the banks are adopting e-commerce solutions to letter of credit and open account transactions in order to stay in the financing business. Accordingly, how TradeCard retains its edge in the provision of a financial supply chain solution while expanding the reach of new markets beciomes an important question to tackle. This case is a study of the TradeCard system, electronic solution development in international trade, and the relationship between TradeCard and banks.

Political Strategies and Realities of dotEU	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS			English	Article						Corporate identity; European union; Internet identity; Internet strategy; top level domain		In this article, the motivations underlying the European Union's (EU) European top level domain (TLD) strategy will be described, complemented by an explorative analysis of the ideas, strategies, and predominantly economic justifications of the European Commission. Since business corporations are the main focus of the EU's Internet strategy, its factual use of TLDs as a means of corporate communications will be questioned in light of the political endeavor to create a European political (Internet) identity. International companies listed in the German stock indices were asked about their Internet communication strategies in order to evaluate dotEU in relation to other TLDs. This is an explorative/qualitative study on the companies' assessment of the EU's Internet business strategy and their own strategic outlook on Internet communication.

It show that it could be optimal for the exporting country to adopt either a different or a parallel trade policy between the two exporting goods (the final product and the subcontracted product). However, a different trade policy that taxes the final-product export and subsidizes the subcontracted-product export is not ever optimal. When the exporting firm is a pure subcontractor, taxing the single export (subcontracted product) becomes the only optimal trade policy of the exporting country. Morever, the exporting country imposes a less aggressive trade policy in response given that the importing country inflicts a more aggressive trade policy.

This paper aims to analyze how companies are exploring Web (Internet) technology for developing new products, based on the concepts of interactivity and connectivity. The adopted methodological approach was case study. Two service companies were studied, selected according to their previous (and preliminary) classification in the Strategic Grid. A plan was developed based on the theoretical background in order to carry out this research. Interviews were made with at least three different professionals (from different areas and hierarchical positions) of each company. Information was collected through semi-structured interviews. The choice of companies of different classification in the Grid is important to analyze the differences and similarities in the new product development process and to allow a comparison among these enterprises.

The implementation of this Standard is a strategic decision of a higher education institution. The institution establishes, documents, implements and maintains a quality management system, and continually improves its effectiveness in accordance with the requirements of the Standard. Within the quality management system, the higher education institution analyses customer needs, defines the processes that lead to providing education services that are acceptable to the customer, and keeps these processes under control. This enables the higher education institution to provide education that consistently fulfills these requirements. Top management provides evidence of its commitment to the development and implementation of the quality management system and the continual improvement of its effectiveness. Finally, the higher education institution plans and implements the monitoring, measurement, analysis and improvement of processes included in the quality management system.

The main concern of Oman Air's top management now is to consolidate these gains and to ensure sustained profitability and growth over the long term. The airline has faced challenges from existing and emerging competitors operating on both full-service and low-cost business models. In addition, the recent strategic decision of the Government of Oman to pull out of the much larger Gulf Air made Oman Air the only national airline of Oman. Oman Air now needs to reposition itself from a major regional airline to a full-fledged international airline to service the long-haul markets.

J	Scavarda, LF; Hamacher, S				Scavarda, Luiz Felipe; Hamacher, Silvio			The Role of SCM Capabilities to Support Automotive Industry Trends	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain management; capabilities; automotive industry; trends		As Supply Chain Management (SCM) becomes essential to generate competitive advantage, the development of capabilities in cooperation with other supply chain members is a premise for success. The goal of this paper is to analyze the role these SCM capabilities play in automotive industry supply chains. The paper offers first a study based in the literature and in interviews regarding trends in the automotive industry, SCM capabilities and their co-relation, which resulted in a formal definition for SCM capability. Then a case study in a European Vehicle Manufacturer is presented and discussed. The case study was conducted with three supply chains embracing, among other significant members, 3 vehicle plants and 2 supplier parks located in Western Europe and in South Africa. Within the case study, we analyze how the SCM capabilities are related to the vehicle manufacturer strategic goals and correlate the trends with the capabilities developed within the three supply chains. The analysis allowed us to conclude that the SCM capabilities identified by the study constitute a response to support trends in the automotive industry, as they intend to bring advantages that obey a new logic in competition based on chains. As a spin off of the research, it was also possible to identify that SCM is still limited to the immediate chain of vehicle manufacturers.

We focus in this paper on the high need of strengthening incentives for circular and repetitive migration of Romanian students. They represent the most relevant pool of the future-be skilled labour force. Overviewing the realities, it may come to no surprise that Romania has less higher education graduates than in EU. Nor that the expenses for the higher education represent nearly the same amount per capita as in the other EU countries, when adjusted with GDP. Nor that, according to international university rankings, Romanian universities score one of the lowest performance in Europe. Above all, today we risk that our best students migrate to western higher education schools without returning to their home country. A deep analysis of this phenomenon reveals an even harsher reality: the propensity of Romanian students to study abroad is even lower than in other neighbouring countries.

The new business model created with digital goods faces various risks, some of which are unprecedented in the traditional trading of physical goods. Thus, companies producing digital goods should understand the new risks. in order to properly trade the digital goods. This research presents supply chain activities which are involved in digital goods from producing the components to globally selling digital goods to consumers. Furthermore, it has identified a comprehensive list of numerous risks involved in the global online trading of the digital goods, presents a risk factor framework with four categories (i.e., environmental risk, strategic risk, technological risk, and operational risk), and shows a newly developed framework for establishing a risk management system for trading digital goods globally online.

J	Caro, DHJ				Caro, Denis H. J.			Evolving E-Health System Symbiosis: Theoretical Constructs in International Realpolitik Space	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						e-health networks; international key informants; transactional powers and skills; transformational powers and skills		The 21st century continues to witness the transformation of organizational systems globally through the deployment of information and communication technologies (ICT). The emerging future is witnessing the convergence of artificial intelligence, biotechnology, nomadic information systems, and nano-technology. This promises to further compel inter-organizational and inter-sectorial interactive transformations. The health care sector is no exception to the inter-organizational dynamic imperatives driven with ICT innovative advances. This article proposes a conceptual model of symbiotic e-health networks in a meta-cultural domain that goes beyond the realm of extant literature on dyadic relationships. The model dimensions are posited on a key informant approach and content analysis of the strategic perceptions of international ICT and health care executives interacting through dyadic partnerships. The findings and implications of the study for the model and further information management research are underscored. The underlying meta-cultural frame is characterized by public governance values and the article explores its perceived role in sustaining symbiotic e-health networks in Canada and Sweden.

J	Firmanzah				Firmanzah			The Effect of Headquarter Integration Mechanisms on Subsidiaries' New Product Success: From Control to Coordination Mechanism	SOUTH EAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						new product launching (NPL); coordination mechanism; control mechanism; and new product performance		New product launching (NPL) to the local market by subsidiary managers is a strategic activity, which requires organizational supports from MNC global network. The NPL activity is marked by high level of uncertainty, risk, and market failure. Thus, a headquarter needs to integrate the subsidiary NPL into global strategy. There are two mechanisms to integrate subsidiaries' activities during NPL process; coordination and control process. By testing the effect of each mechanism on role clarity and functional conflict, I found that coordination mechanism increase role clarity between headquarter and subsidiaries' managers. In contrast, exercising control mechanism reduces role clarity and functional conflict between headquarter and subsidiaries' managers during NPL. This research shows that both role clarity and functional conflict increase new product commercial performance introduced by subsidiary in the local market.

J	Salleh, NAM				Salleh, Noor Akma Mohd			Adoption of Innovative Information Systems by SMEs: Comparing The Role of Firm's Enacted Capabilities of Active Adopters and Non-Active Adopters	SOUTH EAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						innovative information systems; enacted capabilities; adoption behaviour	RESOURCE-BASED THEORY; ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION; USER ACCEPTANCE; E-COMMERCE; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; MODEL; TRUST; STRATEGY; IMPLEMENTATION	The adoption of innovative information systems (IS) by small-and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) across heterogeneous culture, locales, and markets are a critical and an ongoing challenge. Such challenge requires more than just good ideas and extensive resources. It requires organisational capabilities that can be labelled as "enacted capabilities". This study defines enacted capabilities as the firm's ability to mobilise and deploy IS-based resources in combination or co-present with other capabilities within SMEs. Consequently, the aim of this study is to make a contribution by empirically examining the enacted capabilities of SMEs in developing countries that may influence the success of innovative IS adoption. In line with this objective, an innovative IS adoption behaviour investigation is conducted particularly as to why some SMEs are able to be enabled for use and utilise innovative IS, while others fail to do so. A survey of 206 of the CEOs/owners from Malaysian SMEs was conducted. The innovative IS examined was the government's electronic procurement systems. The findings are consistent with the notion that all SMEs have enacted capabilities. Some SMEs integrate and coordinate them in a different way, depending on the context of each organisation. The findings also indicate that strong enacted capabilities and perceived net benefits affect the SMEs' ability to perform or assimilate IS related strategic change.

Development of an ERP Model for Modularly Designed Ships for Medium Scale Shipyards - II: Marketing Management	JOURNAL OF MARINE ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								Marketing is one of most neglected areas in the marine industry. In recent times, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) has become an important information management tool for the integration of different manufacturing modules via an online network thus providing one window access. This allows integration of the manufacturing process leading to a reduction in inventory. The integrated model of manufacturing demands an integrated marketing model that can deal with demand forecasting, product identification and strategic planning, The present series of two papers considers an ERP model for a medium scale shipyard. Part II discusses the nucleus driven integrated marketing management model in an ERP environment for a shipyard. This work discusses the implementation of modern concepts (ie integration and modular design) and incorporate these into the marketing model. The implementation is presented via the analysis of case studies for market analysis and demand forecasting (le shipping, and shipbuilding market forecasting), modular design and its implementation with a consortium of shipyards.

J	Ibrahim, R; Kennedy, D				Ibrahim, R.; Kennedy, D.			Supply chain management program first- and second-order effects model: a new strategic tool	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						supply chain management; competitive strategy; program implementation	METHODOLOGY; COMPANY	Utilisation of supply chain management (SCM) strategies have an implicit objective of gaining an advantage over one's business arena partners, whether they be competition or supply chain partners; an SCM-derived competitive advantage. A literature review accentuated four bases of strategic competition (cost-based, resource-based, time-based and knowledge-based), upon which, such an SCM-derived competitive advantage might be built. A Monash University qualitative research study found that the majority of small- to medium-sized firms have found this to be a risky and unprofitable endeavour. In response, this paper explores the four bases of strategic competition through an exemplary success case found within the Australian textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) industry. The research raised a proposition stated as "effective supply chain management increases shareholder value (SHV)." An effective SCM program influences key success drivers (e.g. expenses, asset utilisation and process cycle time) available to it in a manner that maximises the firm's competitive position, given its chosen strategy. This paper presents a first- to second-order SCM effects matrix model as a small step towards the mainstream achievement of current world-wide best SCM practice. The matrix can be utilised by individuals planning supply chain change processes or teams evaluating potential change initiatives within their supply chain operations. The substructure of the matrix is examination by isolating just the time-based strategic key success drivers, as found in the literature.

J	Yeh, LC				Yeh, Lain-Chyi			The Matters of Applying SWOT Analytic Items, Its Weight System, and Influential Factors in Elementary Schools	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION SCIENCES			Chinese	Article						SWOT; strategy management; school management		SWOT analysis is an important tool for strategic management, and its analytic items are critical for the achieving of analytic quality and making effective decisions. Although the use of SWOT for developing school curriculum plans is the prevailing trend in Taiwan, some researches has shown that it is being used incorrectly in practice. On the other hand, there is also a lack of means of verification of the appropriateness of analytic items. Hence the need for studying the SWOT analytic items and its weight system, as well as other influential factors, to improve the quality of SWOT for use in elementary schools. A framework for SWOT analytic items was proposed and a questionnaire with good reliability and validity was used to test 211 elementary school educators. The results indicated that some analytic items were more frequently noticed and used than others; thus the items could be divided into two groups. Furthermore, a weight items system was also developed. The school's type, location, scale, position and gender can affect the ranking of each item's importance to a varying degree. Besides, each item's importance was positively correlated with the selection of items.

Strategic Maneuvering in Healthcare Technology Markets: The Case of Emdeon Corporation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						case study; e-business model; healthcare technology industry; mergers and acquisitions; related diversification strategy		Healthcare technology markets have been recently identified as potential investment targets. Having survived a major environmental shock, the dot. com bust, firms in the healthcare technology industry are presently experiencing an impressive revenue growth. In this study, we investigate the strategies of Emdeon Corporation, a healthcare technology firm whose e-business model provides clues for achieving a sustained revenue growth and profitability. We trace the current sustainability of Emdeon's e-business model to a related diversification strategy that the firm's upper management has pursued via mergers and acquisitions (M&As). We also address the motivation behind current restructuring of Emdeon's e-business model. We argue that maturation of diversified e-business models leads to the transformation of individual segments into distinct entities focusing on specific technology markets.

An Efficient Memory System for Java	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY			English	Article						Java; dynamic memory management; memory allocation; memory deallocation		One of the significant issues that hinder the performance of Java program execution is dynamic memory usage. Some researchers stated that in executing Java programs, 15.58% of the CPU time is used in handling memory allocation requests and 28.08% of the CPU time in garbage collection. A statistical study on the dynamic memory usage behavior of both desktops and servers, Java applications show similar locality, and that memory allocation requests are concentrated on small block sizes (< 1K bytes), and blocks allocated usually have short life times. Based on these findings, we proposed a hardware/software approach in handling memory allocation and deallocation requests that gives a 17% overall performance gain in Java program execution.

Implementation of community wide picture archiving communication and radiology information systems across a strategic health authority area	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY			English	Article								This paper provides an overview of the work undertaken within Kent and Medway health economy to deploy a county wide Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS) and Radiology Information System (RIS) through the National programme for IT (NPFIT). This programme was the first to implement the new model of community PACS and RIS for an entire health economy (previously a Strategic Health Authority) through the Local Service Provider (LSP) contract. The model was based upon a hosted solution from a data centre. The programme involved five separate NHS trusts working collaboratively together to ensure that a single RIS and PACs could be deployed through agreement on areas such as coding, governance, training, and ongoing management. The programme was highly successful and all sites went live on time. The challenges that are currently being faced are how to maintain the collaborative approach when the system is operational. The challenges include central management, systems updates and data management.

Don't move until you see it - Searching for intellectual maturity	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INQUIRY			English	Article						integral learning; intellectual richness; mastery versus maturity; strategic perspective		Searching for Bobby Fischer is an exemplary film for showcasing multiple kinds of learning, ways of knowing, and levels of excellence. Key players in the film engage in lively interplay among analytical, practical, and creative streams of intelligence. Using examples and analogies from the film, the author distinguishes between the relatively focused prowess of intellectual mastery, and the more inclusive, enriched perspective of intellectual maturity. Together these align to support the film's keynote advice, "Don't move until you see it. " By discussing this advice in relation to various professional experiences and observations, the author argues for the importance of intellectual maturity as a vital component of professional development. To help clarify the argument, he includes metaphorical support from the art of warfare. The resultant message signifies the importance of both intellectual mastery and maturity, but suggests that intellectual maturity is frequently marginalized or excluded.

One of the factors that drive their strategic behaviour is technological. We propose a technology indicator to identify conditions under which the aircraft companies have incentives to join a coalition. For this, we provide measurement of the side-payments necessary to sign a strategic alliance aimed at reducing technological barriers in the market. The results suggest that the existence of side-payments guarantees the stability of a strategic alliance if the gap in the technological level between the firms is high, or competition is through prices. For monopoly, a strategic alliance is profitable, but never stable. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Johnston, K; Muganda, N; Theys, K				Johnston, Kevin; Muganda, Nixon; Theys, Karen			KEY ISSUES FOR CIOS IN SOUTH AFRICA	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES			English	Article						Challenges; CIO; Key Issues; Rankings; Strategy and Trends		Business strategy, operations, communication and technology have converged and resulted in increased demand for business flexibility. Chief Information Officers (CIOs) are particularly challenged because they operate at the intersection between information technology, their organisations, and society. Amidst increasing emphasis on cost-efficiency, information technology resource investment and emergence of new technologies, stakeholders need to understand the most relevant issues within a three-to five-year period. This study was undertaken to contribute to the body of knowledge around key information systems issues in South Africa, with its unique social issues. Thirty-one responses were received from South African CIOs surveyed in late 2004. The top issues were: Security and control, Building a responsive IT infrastructure, IT value management, Service delivery, and Improving IS strategic planning. The ranked list of issues was compared to previous studies, and further analysed by industry and source of IT services (in-house, outsource or combination). Industry and the sourcing of information services were found to have an effect on the ranking of key issues.

J	Cizmar, S; Lisjak, S				Cizmar, Sanja; Lisjak, Sandra			Tourism Master Plans An Effective Tourism Destination Management Tool in SEE	SOUTH EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS			English	Article								This paper examines the hypothesis that in SEE transitional economies there are two key success factors to insure the successful development of tourism. The first factor is the building up of an active role of government in structuring a state tourism strategy focused on increasing the international competitiveness of the given country's tourism sector. This would speed up the process of tourism development in a sustainable way, since the preservation of space and benefits for the local population should be the main strategic goals of future tourism development in SEE. The second success factor is the elaboration of tourism development master plans at a local level within the country, carried out with the broad involvement of stakeholders with a strong orientation towards pragmatic implementation. This paper uses the case study of Croatia, the most successful country in terms of tourism in SEE.

J	Hamsal, M; Agung, IGN				Hamsal, Mohammad; Agung, I. Gusti Ngurah			Paradoxical Strategies and Firm Performance: The Case of Indonesian Banking Industry	SOUTH EAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						environmental uncertainty; paradoxical strategies; strategic flexibility; strategic consistency; firm performance		Recently, research on paradoxical strategies has been considered critical in winning in the competitive dynamic landscape, characterized by uncertainty and rapid changes in the business environment. Such environmental uncertainties require firm to apply paradoxical strategies; combining strategic flexibility and strategic consistency (Parnell, 1994). This study addresses three main questions: what is the effect of strategic flexibility on firm's performance; what is the effect of strategic consistency on firm's performance; what is the contingent effect of perceived environmental uncertainty on the relationship between paradoxical strategies and firm's performance. Questionnaires were distributed to 131 CEOs or members of top management team of Indonesian commercial banks (including sharia banks); and the 59 returned responses were analyzed to test hypotheses. The results indicate that strategic flexibility has positive effect on bank`s performance, while strategic consistency does not have significant effect on bank's performance. In terms of combining these two paradoxical strategies, the results of this study confirm that the effect of strategic flexibility on bank's performance depends on strategic consistency and environmental uncertainty.

J	Nasserdine, K; Mimi, Z; Bevan, B				Nasserdine, Khaled; Mimi, Ziad; Bevan, Blair			Environmental management of the stone cutting industry in Hebron, Palestine	ARAB GULF JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH			English	Article						stone cutting industry; slurry disposal; environmental management; Hebron; Palestine		Environmental Management of the stone cutting industry in Hebron, Palestine, is required to reduce the industry's adverse impacts on the downstream agricultural land and on the drinking water aquifers. This situation required the implementation of an industrial wastewater management strategic approach and technology within the environmental need and available technical and financial resources. Ten pilot projects at different locations were built at Hebron to reduce or eliminate the incompatible discharge of the liquid and solid waste to the environment and improve the stone cutting industry's effluent quality. A review of existing practices and jar test experiments were used to optimize the water recycling and treatment facilities. The factors reviewed included influent pumping rates and cycles, selection of the optimal coagulant type and addition methods, control of sludge recycling process, control over flow rates, control locations of influent and effluent, and sludge depth. Based on the optimized doses and Turbidity results, it was determined that the use of Fokland polymer with an optimal dose of 1.5 mg/L could achieve the target turbidity levels. The completion of the pilot projects resulted in the elimination of 18% of the total stone cutting waste discharges in Hebron. The results included an improvement in the recycled effluent quality by 44-99%. This in turn reduced the long term operating costs for each participating firm. A full-scale project that will include all the stone cutting firms in Hebron industrial area is required.

J	Ahn, EY				Ahn, Eun-Young			ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS OF NATIONAL NATURAL GAS STORAGE	JOURNAL OF MINING INSTITUTE			English	Article								Natural gas storage is meaningful for governments undertaking national energy risk management at the potential stage. The analytical solution used in this study is based on the DIS-Risk simulation model developed by P.N.Leiby & D.Jones (1993) in order to analyze strategic petroleum reserves. Annual natural gas supply disruption is simulated herein via the beta probability distribution, and then it affects annual natural gas import prices, supply and demand. Finally natural gas supply disruption causes gross domestic product (GDP) losses and higher natural gas import costs. As the result of the Monte Carlo simulation for 5,000 times results in the domestic natural gas supply disruption, the national natural gas storage capacity is estimated as the range from 1.30 to 2.25 million tons. The economic effect of avoiding losses ranges from US$ 10,9 billion to US$ 17,7 billion and the total cost US$ 3,4 billion to US$ 5,6 billion over a thirty-year period from 2006 to 2035.

J	Ahsan, S				Ahsan, Syed			IT enabled counter terrorism infrastructure: issues and challenges	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC SECURITY AND DIGITAL FORENSICS			English	Article						counter terrorism; disaster management; homeland security; biometric technologies; heterogeneous resources; interoperability		In the post 11 September 2001, terrorism has been an immediate and most serious threat to the free world because of its real and potential damage to the infrastructure, economy and people. In response to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, developed and developing countries, such as USA and Pakistan, have emerged as front line states in the fight against terrorism with the following objectives: (1) prevent future terrorist attacks, (2) reduce the nations vulnerability and (3) minimise the damage and recovery from attacks that occur. In order to achieve these objectives, we require new approaches to intelligence and information gathering and its analysis through the use of information technology. In this paper, we attempt to identify (1) the areas where IT can contribute in accomplishing these three strategic security objectives, (2) the unique IT problems and challenges in counter terrorism applications where such applications are being used and developed such as in USA and (3) lessons learned for developing countries such as Pakistan, so that an IT counter terrorism infra structure can be established with minimum cost in terms of time and money.

Although initially applied as a financial management tool in private enterprise, higher education scholars have recently explored the relevance of activity-based costing (ABC) procedures as a means of responding to demands for increased fiscal accountability and efficiency in post-secondary institutions. This case study builds upon previous higher education cost-accounting scholarship by situating the research in the community college sector and by incorporating management and classified staff in the activity and cost analyses. The research design and findings described in this article illustrate the utility of activity-based costing procedures as a means of identifying what it costs a community college to perform a variety of institutional activities. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for practice and strategies for integrating activity-based cost accounting into existing assessment, evaluation, and strategic planning initiatives.

J	Chivaka, R				Chivaka, Richard			Cost management along the supply chain	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH			English	Article						Supply chain management; Cost Management Techniques; Management Accounting; Case Study; Developing country	TRUST	The potential of strategic cost management tools to support inter-company supply chain value creation has been highlighted by a number of researchers. However, not much research using case studies has been done to demonstrate how cost management tools are applied along supply chains. In addition, limited research has focused on cost management along supply chains in developing countries such as South Africa. This research uses multiple case studies to investigate and gain insight into the manner in which cost management is applied along a product's supply chain in a developing country - South Africa. The main objective of the study is to contribute to a better understanding of how costs along supply chains can be managed using cost management tools. The paper demonstrates that cost management techniques such as target costing, total quality management, just-in-time and life-cycle costing are being applied. In addition, the research reveals that these cost management techniques assist in cost planning, inventory reduction, cycle time reduction, improved customer satisfaction leading to lower returns and warranty costs, proactive management of quality-related costs, and extended cost analysis across the supply chains	[Chivaka, Richard] Univ Cape Town, Dept Accounting, Cape Town, South Africa		Chivaka, R (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Accounting, Cape Town, South Africa.

J	Flapan, M				Flapan, M.			A new risk-based standard for domestic fast craft in Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								The last 30 years has seen the development and widespread use of commercial craft that operate at speed. This paper gives an overview of the new standard for domestic Fast Craft that has been developed by the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments of Australia as part of the National Standard for Commercial Vessels. The reasons for the new standard are first explained with reference to a set of overarching strategic principles. Existing standards for similar vessels are examined, with reasons given as to why they have not been simply adopted. The distinction between a Fast Craft and a High-speed Craft is highlighted and a Category F2 Fast Craft defined. An explanation is given as to the methodology used to develop the standard including the roles of incident statistics, the High-speed Craft Code, a risk management workshop, and stakeholder input via reference groups and public comment. A description is given of the structure of the fast craft standard and how it is to be used in conjunction with the standards for conventional vessels. The incrementalist approach is introduced and its practical application to grade requirements within the standard demonstrated by example. Substantive changes to the standard that resulted from public comment are described. The cost of implementing the requirements in the public comment draft and the final standard are then examined and compared.

Platinum Group of Metals: a strategic assessment of the South African industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						competitiveness; country risk; Platinum Group of Metals; South Africa; strategy		In order to analyse the strategic issues with regard to the South African Platinum Group of Metals (PGM) industry, a risk analysis and an assessment of the competitiveness of the industry were conducted. The analysis of risk related to market conditions indicates a relatively low risk rating driven by increased demand for jewellery and autocatalysts, while the industry is exposed to moderate risk for raw materials and supporting services, which is expected to remain moderate in future. Overall, the current risk for production factors was found to be moderate and is expected to remain moderate over the medium term. The results of industry risk analysis indicate that the PGM industry is currently exposed to moderate risk. Applying Porter's diamond model (Porter, 1990), the research found that the South Africa's PGM industry has a very strong platform and is expected to become more competitive in future, although increased cooperation will still be evident. The competitiveness of South African producers is expected to increase over the medium term, since most of the expansion will come on stream in the near future. The paper also discusses the development potential of South Africa in line with the exploitation of PGM.	[Garg, A. K.] Univ Botswana, Civil Engn Dept, Private Bag 0061, Gaborone, Botswana; [Garg, A.

J	Ghani, ABA; Saud, MB				Ghani, Ahmad Bashawir Abdul; Saud, Mohammad Basir			A QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC ALLIANCES BUILT FROM A STUDY OF MALAYSIAN ENTERPRISES	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES-JIS			English	Article								Looking at the rate at which organizations/firms are entering into strategic alliances of late, one can understand and/or appreciate the increased research in the area of strategic alliances. All seek to increase our knowledge and/or understanding of the potentialities, as well as the adversities inherent in the formation of strategic alliances. For Malaysian firms, alliances can provide the means to extend business activity and compete against internationally based competitors. More recently, the Malaysian press has been inundated with news about the emergence of many more such alliances. What is the nature of alliances formed by businesses in Malaysia and how do those alliances contribute to business development? This research first examines theory supporting the classification of alliances in the literature, and then explores managers' perceptions on motivation driving the formation of alliances and the role of alliances in a business's strategic direction. When data identifying the purpose for entering the alliance and benefits received from the alliance were linked to data measuring alliance performance, three major dimensions emerged, which together describe strategic motivation or intent for the range of alliances observed in the data. The framework developed through this research provides a management perspective of building alliances, which supports Sheth and Pravatiyar's(1992) prior classification of strategic (exclusive arrangements that create new opportunities), and operational (enhancing current business capabilities) alliances, with the addition of alliances created to defend past strategic activities against competitive and/or environmental threats.

J	Green, B; Wood, S				Green, Barrie; Wood, Simon			Training for plurality - developing modern multi-professional forensic practice	JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE			English	Article						theory into practice; forensic multi-professional training; teamwork; flexible teaching; staff development; skills gap; forensic psychiatry; forensic nurse; staff induction costs		In contemporary forensic mental health and learning disability services effective care and risk management, which is safe for individuals and the public, can only be delivered by drawing upon differing perspectives and interventions. In practice uni-disciplinary training abounds, but the authors found a lack of formal training inherently constructed to be multidisciplinary. Therefore, a course was developed, in conjunction with a university partner, to meet this need. This modular course is flexible in nature, but is normally delivered over one semester leading to certification. In addition, there is the option of either essay or portfolio submission providing access to credits toward other academic awards. This programme of study, 'Professional Practice in Secure Environments' was recently cited as an example of good practice in From Values to Action, the CNO review of mental health nursing (NIMHE, 2006). Modules begin from a foundation of theory and relate it intimately to practice; students develop an understanding of multidisciplinary working by both training together and training in each others' conceptual frameworks. Participants to date include those from health, criminal justice, and social care arenas, and those with no previous higher study have submitted essays. Evaluations are positive and are used to refine delivery and content. The authors conclude that the course demystifies practice and academia, and provides access to both. This is an integral part of the training strategy, which is directed to meeting current and future service needs. Current and future developments and expansion of forensic mental health provision into new types of service will be less effective without a move away from traditional educational approaches. Services to meet the specific needs of groups such as secure long-stay and personality disorders cannot be sustained effectively without a parallel development of new types of training. The strategic thinking behind this course, practical obstacles encountered, and solutions developed are described in this paper.

USING A MIRROR, MICROSCOPE AND BINOCULARS TO REFLECT ON A STRATEGIC AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT COMMUNITY SERVICE LEARNING MODULE	JOURNAL FOR NEW GENERATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Community service learning; higher education context; strategic agriculture management; quality academic outcomes; reflection		In general, the monitoring and evaluation of community service learning modules is concentrated almost exclusively on the immediate impact they have on students. For the purposes of this article, the impact is extended to the way in which a community service learning module holds up a mirror for students in which to see themselves, becomes a microscope for the examination of society, and binoculars with which to perceive what lies ahead. Thus, the purpose of this article is not only to investigate what happens to third-year students during the course of the community service learning module in Strategic Agricultural Management at the University of the Free State, but also on how these students act on what they encounter during this time. Apart from demonstrating how to obtain quality learning through serving, the analysis of these results will also illustrate how to adapt and improve a community service learning module for the attainment of quality academic outcomes.

J	Hooper, ASC				Hooper, A. S. C.			Engaging Student Voice to Monitor and Improve a Post-Experience ICT Management Program	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDAGOGIES & LEARNING			English	Article								Good course design relies on an understanding of student needs and demographics. It should also incorporate feedback from graduates familiar both with the programme and the marketplace in which students will be employed. The dynamic nature of the skills mix required of the Information and Communications Technology professions make course design for this group particularly problematic. This paper reports on the demographics and self-reported needs of students in a taught masters programme in Information Management within one New Zealand university. It relates this institution's response to these findings and comments on their wider significance to the sector. The main findings confirm the need for course design to reflect the relative maturity, career focus and sophistication of this student group, and the need for curriculum design to deliver a significant strategic management component to midcareer ICT professionals. They also identify possible handicaps that professional stereotypes might place on career development.	[Hooper, A. S.

J	Hosseini, A; Mohammady, M				Hosseini, Ali; Mohammady, Mostafa			The rule of next generation managers Strategic IS\IT manager	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						information technology; information systems; strategic management; Chief information officer		In their roles as senior managers, Chief Information Officers (CIOs) are often responsible for the initiation and implementation of information systems (ISs) that are vital to the success, and even survival of the firm. In so doing, CIOs must exercise influence successfully in order to attain these objectives. The strategic role of the CIO is becoming ever more complex, requiring an expansion of the organisational and structural possibilities for filling that role. This research examines CIO role in Iranian organisations. In this paper, results from a survey of Iranian CIOs are presented. Iranian CIOs have on average worked in the current organisation for eight years, have worked in information technology (IT) for 12 years, report mostly to the financial director, have 11 people reporting to them. A large percentage has at least a master's degree. Also, formal IS planning tended to be adopted by organisations with higher annual revenue, larger number of total employees, and broader span of control (i.e., the number of people reporting to the CIO). Higher CIO reporting level was also associated with greater extent of information systems plan implementation.

J	Hou, CJ; Zhao, GZ				Hou Chengjun; Zhao Gaozheng			Strategic Study on Integration of Port and City Development in Rizhao	CHINESE JOURNAL OF POPULATION RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						port city; integration of port and city; transportation system; industry near to the port; city planning; locational advantage		agglomeration of the Yangtze Delta (UAYD), one of the most developed regions of China, has witnessed an increasing prevalence in building ecological cities when the ecological cities are pursued by many modem cities, and great achievements have been made in this regard. It is inevitable, however, that certain problems exist during the construction of ecological city, which include but not limited to non-harmonious development of urban complex ecosystem, and the difficulty in quantifying eco-city construction or incomplete quantification in assessing the constructiorr of present and future eco-city. Based on the analysis on social-economic conditions and regional conditions of the UAYD, this paper attempts to set up an index system of eco-cities combining with local characteristics, and to adopt the indices of eco-city, urban harmony, and eco-city colligate to evaluate the ecological level, urban harmonious development and eco-city construction of cities within the UAYD. Results indicate that among 15 cities in UAYD, Suzhou City ranks the highest in terms of eco-city construction, whereas Nantong ranks relatively lower; sustainable eco-city construction is possible only when cities are developed in every respect of harmony.

J	Howard, D				Howard, Dennis			A regional economic performance matrix - an aid to regional economic policy development	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICY			English	Article								This paper presents a model for regional policy makers as an aid to developing policy for regional economic development. The approach to developing the model follows strategic management principles whereby planning is based on setting objectives in the light of environmental scanning for factors that are relevant to development. The model also addresses some of the concerns associated with regional policy planning, namely whether the approach should be driven from the top-down or the bottom-up. Given the regional context, the model positions towns in terms of how well their employment creation corresponds to regional benchmarks. The model therefore provides policy direction for regional town planning. The Richmond-Tweed region is used as a practical example.
