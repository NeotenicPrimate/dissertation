Collaborative networks enable the rapid establishment of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 during nationwide lockdown in New Zealand	PEERJ			English	Article						COVID-19; Serology; SARS-CoV-2; Neutralising antibodies; Spike protein		Background: Serological assays that detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are critical for determining past infection and investigating immune responses in the COVID-19 pandemic. We established ELISA-based immunoassays using locally produced antigens when New Zealand went into a nationwide lockdown and the supply chain of diagnostic reagents was a widely held domestic concern. The relationship between serum antibody binding measured by ELISA and neutralising capacity was investigated using a surrogate viral neutralisation test (sVNT). Methods: A pre-pandemic sera panel (n = 113), including respiratory infections with symptom overlap with COVID-19, was used to establish assay specificity. Sera from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (n = 21), and PCR-negative patients with respiratory symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (n = 82) that presented to the two largest hospitals in Auckland during the lockdown period were included. A two-step IgG ELISA based on the receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike protein was adapted to determine seropositivity, and neutralising antibodies that block the RBD/ hACE-2 interaction were quantified by sVNT. Results: The calculated cut-off (>0.2) in the two-step ELISA maximised specificity by classifying all pre-pandemic samples as negative. Sera from all PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were classified as seropositive by ELISA >= 7 days after symptom onset. There was 100% concordance between the two-step ELISA and the sVNT with all 7+ day sera from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients also classified as positive with respect to neutralising antibodies. Of the symptomatic PCR-negative cohort, one individual with notable travel history was classified as positive by two-step ELISA and sVNT, demonstrating the value of serology in detecting prior infection. Conclusions: These serological assays were established and assessed at a time when human activity was severely restricted in New Zealand. This was achieved by generous sharing of reagents and technical expertise by the international scientific community, and highly collaborative efforts of scientists and clinicians across the country. The assays have immediate utility in supporting clinical diagnostics, understanding transmission in high-risk cohorts and underpinning longer-term 'exit strategies based on effective vaccines and therapeutics.

To develop strategies to reduce antimicrobial use, it is important to understand how stakeholders along the veal production chain perceive the current situation and to find the key issues that challenge them about calf health management and antimicrobial use. However, there has been insufficient research into the individual contexts of the supply chain actors, and the central themes that they perceive to enable or limit their actions remain largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the perceptions of the current situation of the Swiss veal production system, in terms of calf health management and antimicrobial use held by industry stakeholders, i.e. dairy farmers, veal producers, traders, slaughterhouse managers, advisors and veterinarians. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 27 respondents and analyzed using content analysis. The results show that stakeholders are aware of the current need to minimize resistance development and the related risks for public health by reducing antimicrobial use. The main reason for high antimicrobial use was nominated as the practice of purchasing calves from many different dairy farms and bringing them together in large groups at a young age, which exposes them to a variety of pathogens that their still developing immune systems are not able to cope with. To prevent and combat infectious diseases which are a frequent consequence of this practice, antimicrobial group treatments are commonly administered, which significantly raises the total amount of antimicrobials used. Group level treatments with antimicrobials were associated directly with the large-scale veal farming system, which uses excess calves from specialized dairy farms, and which the respondents perceive to cause financial pressure and mutual dependencies among participants. In addition, disunity between actors was perceived as a further challenge to find strategies for the reduction of antimicrobial use. The respondents suggested downscaling the production system so that calves can be treated individually but conceded that the current system may be very difficult to change, so also suggested various improvement measures within the existing system. The results of this study provide a basis for further research to investigate possible interventions that could considerably reduce antimicrobial use in veal production.

J	Sreedharan, VR; Raju, R; Sunder, MV; Antony, J				Sreedharan, Raja, V; Raju, R.; Sunder, Vijaya M.; Antony, Jiju			Assessment of Lean Six Sigma Readiness (LESIRE) for manufacturing industries using fuzzy logic	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY & RELIABILITY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fuzzy logic; Lean Six Sigma (LSS); FLSS; FPII	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; SUPPLY CHAIN; QUALITY IMPROVEMENT; AGILITY EVALUATION; DECISION-MAKING; RISK-ASSESSMENT; IMPLEMENTATION; ENTERPRISES; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT	Purpose Many organizations have reported significant benefits after the implementation of Lean Six Sigma (LSS). Embracing LSS requires asking some important questions: How Lean Six Sigma Readiness (LESIRE) can be measured? How can an organization identify the barriers for LESIRE? Answers to these questions are critical to both academicians and practitioners. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach This study illustrates the development process of a Lean Six Sigma Readiness (LESIRE) evaluation model to assess an organization's readiness for LSS deployment using the fuzzy approach. The model was developed from 4 enablers, 16 criteria and 46 attributes of LSS, identified through a literature review. Findings To demonstrate the efficiency of the model, this study testing the LESIRE evaluation model in three Indian SMEs. Using experts' ratings and weight, the researchers calculated the Fuzzy Lean Six Sigma index (FLSS) which indicates the LESIRE level of an organization and the Fuzzy Performance Importance Index (FPII) that helps to identify the barriers for LESIRE. Research limitations/ implications - The main limitations of this study are that it did not consider the failure factors of LSS for model development and the LESIRE was only tested in manufacturing industries. Thus, future researchers could focus on developing a model with failure factors. The results obtained from the SMEs show that LESIRE is capable of assessing LESIRE in an industrial scenario and helps practitioners to measure LESIRE for the future decision making process. Practical implications - The LESIRE model is easy to understand and use without much computation complexity. This simplicity makes the LESIRE evaluation model unique from other LSS models. Further, LESIRE was tested in three different SMEs, and it aided them to identify and improve their weak areas, thereby readying them for LSS deployment. Originality/ value - The main contribution of this study it proposes a LESIRE model that evaluates the organization for FLSS and FPII for LESIRE, which is essential for the organization embarking on an LSS journey.

Assessing the Impacts of COVID-19 on the Industrial Sectors and Economy of China	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article; Early Access						COVID-19; disasters; economic loss; production and supply chain; static CGE models	BUSINESS INTERRUPTION IMPACTS; INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL; INFLUENZA; RESILIENCE; COST; DISASTERS; CONSEQUENCES; OUTBREAK; RECOVERY; NETWORK	Since December 2019, the COVID-19 epidemic has been spreading continuously in China and many countries in the world, causing widespread concern among the whole society. To cope with the epidemic disaster, most provinces and cities in China have adopted prevention and control measures such as home isolation, blocking transportation, and extending the Spring Festival holiday, which has caused a serious impact on China's output of various sectors, international trade, and labor employment, ultimately generating great losses to the Chinese economic system in 2020. But how big is the loss? How can we assess this for a country? At present, there are few analyses based on quantitative models to answer these important questions. In the following, we describe a quantitative-based approach of assessing the potential impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the economic system and the sectors taking China as the base case. The proposed approach can provide timely data and quantitative tools to support the complex decision-making process that government agencies (and the private sector) need to manage to respond to this tragic epidemic and maintain stable economic development. Based on the available data, this article proposes a hypothetical scenario and then adopts the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to calculate the comprehensive economic losses of the epidemic from the aspects of the direct shock on the output of seriously affected sectors, international trade, and labor force. The empirical results show that assuming a GDP growth rate of 4-8% in the absence of COVID-19, GDP growth in 2020 would be -8.77 to -12.77% after the COVID-19. Companies and activities associated with transportation and service sectors are among the most impacted, and companies and supply chains related to the manufacturing subsector lead the economic losses. Finally, according to the calculation results, the corresponding countermeasures and suggestions are put forward: disaster recovery for key sectors such as the labor force, transportation sector, and service sectors should be enhanced; disaster emergency rescue work in highly sensitive sectors should be carried out; in the long run, precise measures to strengthen the refined management of disaster risk with big data resources and means should be taken.

It allows us to make calculations of the efficiency of the use of inventories, helps minimize the cost of transportation and storage and to avoid fines for lack of inventory in the presence of demand. The suggested model takes into account the dependence of the price of the received reserves, warehouse costs, the cost of holding stocks, the amount of storage costs and penalties for customer stocks that have been unloaded on time. The model will allow us to avoid delays in supply, determine the size and guarantee optimal inventory levels. It is proved that rational inventory management enables companies to calculate the optimal amount of reserve ordering, and the time interval between such orders. Putting this model into practice will allow for managing of the logistical and warehouse costs, determining the risk of not receiving or reducing the company's profits due to the excess inventory costs, and understanding of the efficiency of turnover of inventories. Purpose. The aim of the study is to construct an economic and mathematical model of inventory management of the enterprise, taking into account the dependence of the shipping cost from the supplier to the warehouse, the cost of holding the stocks, the amount of storage costs and penalties for non-shipped products. Methodology. Approbation of theoretical developments was carried out in the application package Statistica and the use of the module MARSPline - an integral element of technology Data Mining Results. The theoretical contribution. The main dependencies influencing the formation of the value of stocks were discovered on the basis of this and a regression model of the optimal size of stocks was constructed with a fairly precise approximation; calculations were made of the efficiency of the use of inventories, minimizing the total costs associated with delivery, storage and fines for the absence of stocks at availability of demand for them. Practical implications. We have constructed, investigated and tested the economic and mathematical model of the optimal size of stocks, which takes into account the dependence of the shipping cost from the supplier to the warehouse, the cost of holding the stocks, the amount of storage costs and penalties for non-shipped products.

The case of early adopters of C-TPAT supply chain security certification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Prospect theory; Administrative innovation; Standard adoption	PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; LOGISTICS; DECISIONS; STRATEGY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on adoption of certified management standards, specifically public standards. Such standards play an increasingly important role in today's business environment. However, to generate adoption benefits, they must be first widely accepted - a situation where they have become viewed as the de facto norms. For this state to occur early adopters play a critical role. Past research has argued that early adopters, in exchange for assuming more risk, are rewarded with higher economic returns. Yet, these findings are based on private, not public standards. With public standards, early adopters do not receive such benefits. There is evidence that public standards are becoming more important. This situation leads to a simple but important question addressed in this study - if early adopters assume the risks of embracing a new public standard without economic benefits, then what is their motivation? To resolve this question, this study draws on agency theory and prospect theory. The authors argue that early adopters embrace such standards because of their desire to minimize risk resulting from failure to support the goal at the heart of the public standards. Design/methodology/approach - Data were obtained from the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) Partners Cost Benefit Survey and analyzed through structural equation modeling. Findings - Early adopters of public standards are not driven by economic benefits but rather by the need to minimize their exposure to the risks associated with failing to satisfy the goals associated with a public standard. In other words, they were motivated by the need to minimize costs. In the case of C-TPAT, these costs are those of failing to provide or improve network security. Research limitations/implications - This study has shed new light on the standards adoption process by clarifying the specific motivations that drive early adoption of a public standard. In addition to identifying the loss aversion motives of early adopters and economic benefit motives of later adopters, the authors have also elaborated on the notion that standards have differing levels of precedence, particularly when comparing private with public standards. Practical implications - In a world characterized by increasing demands for outcomes such as improved security and where governmental funding is falling, due to growing deficits and governments that are becoming more conservative, the authors expect the use of public standards to increase. Originality/value - Different from prior research on private standard, the paper focuses on the organizations involved in the adoption and diffusion of a public standard, with special attention being devoted to the early adopters. The paper provides a theoretical explanation for the actions of early adopters of a public standard through the theoretical lens of prospect theory.

Purpose This case study concerns the social assessment of an innovative technology to treat the wastewater of a microelectronics company. In order to produce electronic components and semiconductors, the company has to treat and dispose of relevant wastewater streams containing various toxic substances. The wastewater streams need to be treated in order to protect the eco-system, representing a high cost for the company and a potential impact on the environment. For this reason, the company developed a LIFE project to demonstrate the viability to decrease the burdens on water bodies. The positive outcome of the test on the pilot plant paved the way for the construction of the full-scale plant that will treat all the wastewater generated by the company. The objective of this paper is the socio-economic assessment of a full-scale plant designed to treat three different kinds of wastewater. Methods The assessment of socio-economic potential impacts of a new technology has been carried out through the PSILCA (Product Social Impact Life Cycle Assessment) database implementation to evaluate 65 social indicators of a wastewater treatment plant. Results The line with the highest impact is the one which treats tetramethylammonium hydroxide; this is because this wastewater flow is the most abundant (14 and 43 times greater than the other wastewaters, respectively). The most affected stakeholder is the Local Community, followed by the Actors of the Value Chain; in fact, the results referred to the functional unit considered exceed 300,000 medium risk hours in both cases. For the Local Community this result arises from the indicator "Contribution to environmental load," which is understandable considering the object of the study since this indicator includes health effects. As far as the Value Chain Actors stakeholder is concerned, the two indicators most impacted are "Corruption" and "Social responsibility along the supply chain". The analysis conducted has also shown that upstream has a fundamental relevance for the social risks detected. Conclusions Considering the current lack of studies on both environmental and social impacts of wastewater treatment, and the fact that Social Life Cycle Assessment has not been widely used in this field, as emerged from literature review, this work is the first use of the PSILCA database to assess an industrial wastewater plant. The use of a social life cycle assessment database allows the value chain of a product system to be considered: the results show that most of the overall social risk derives from upstream sectors.

Residual antimicrobial agents in food originating from animals	TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Antimicrobial agents; Residual; Animals; Livestock; Growth promotors; Food chain; COVID-19 pandemic	ANTIBIOTIC USE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; RESISTANCE; BANGLADESH; POULTRY; FARMS; CHITTAGONG; MEAT	Background: The agricultural food products industry in Bangladesh depends on utilizing antimicrobials indiscriminately as growth promoters and for controlling infectious diseases. Thus, there is always a risk of antimicrobial agent accumulation in food sources that originate from agricultural production. Methods: In the present study, we collected data from published articles between January, 2013 and December, 2019 on antimicrobial residues in human food sources such as meat, milk, eggs, and fishes. Results: Liver contained the highest percentage of antimicrobial residues (74%; 95% CI: 59.66?85.37) against the in vitro enteric pathogen Escherichia coli in layer chickens. Similar results were demonstrated in liver (68%; 95% CI: 53.30?80.48) and kidney (66%, 95% CI: 51.23?78.79) of layer chickens against Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis. Amongst all antibiotics, the highest concentrations of ciprofloxacin were detected in kidney (48.57%; 95% CI: 31.38?66.01), followed by liver (47.56; 95% CI: 40.88?54.30) of broiler chickens. Ciprofloxacin was also present in liver (46.15%; 95% CI: 33.70?58.96) of layer chickens. The percentage of ciprofloxacin in thigh and breast meat in broiler bird were 41.54% (95% CI: 34.54?48.79) and 37.95% (95% CI: 31.11?45.15) respectively. Enrofloxacin was the second most dominant antimicrobial agent and was present in the liver of both types of poultry (Broiler and Layer chickens: 41.54%; 95% CI: 29.44?54.4 and 437.33%; 95% CI: 30.99?44.01). The prevalence rates of enrofloxacin in thigh and breast meat of broiler chickens were 24.10% (95% CI: 18.28?30.73) and 20.51% (95% CI: 15.08?26.87), respectively. Tetracycline, a commonly used antibiotic in livestock, was present in the liver (49.23%; 95% CI: 36.60?61.93) of layer chickens. In case of aquaculture food products, the highest amount of amoxicillin (683.2 mg/kg) was detected in Tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus), followed by 584.4 mg/kg in climbing perch (Anabas testudineus) and 555.6 mg/kg in Rui fish (Labeo rohita). Among the five types of fishes, Rui fish (0.000515 mg/kg) contained the highest concentrations of chloramphenicol antibiotic residues. Conclusions: The presence of antimicrobial residues in meat, milk, egg, and fish is a serious public health threat due to the potential induction of antimicrobial resistance. It can negatively impact the food supply chain, especially with the current strain that it is already facing with the current COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of the present study highlight the ongoing risk of residual antimicrobial agents in food of animal origin in Bangladesh and countries with similar practices. This can draw the attention of public health officials to propose plans to mitigate or stop this practice.

J	Grove, PM; Conrad, JL; Harris, TG; Dahlen, J				Grove, Patrick M.; Conrad, Joseph L.; Harris, Thomas G., Jr.; Dahlen, Joseph			Consulting Forester Timber Sale Practices in the US South	FOREST SCIENCE			English	Article						timber harvesting; Southern wood supply chain; nonindustrial private forests	UNITED-STATES; SERVICES; PRICES; INFORMATION; WISCONSIN; IMPACT	Private timber sale transactions are vital to the forest products industry in the US South. Consulting foresters often assist private landowners in administering timber sales, and their decisions and practices have a major impact on landowner compensation, satisfaction, and market efficiency. This study used a mixed-mode survey of consulting foresters in 11 southern states to examine contract terms, timber sale practices, and market conditions on private sales. Responses were received from 430 consultants, resulting in a 37 percent response rate. Final harvests are primarily offered to bidders, whereas thinnings are more likely to have timber prices negotiated. Pay-as-cut payment terms are typical for thinnings, but less common in the Mountains where lump sum is relatively more common. Well under 50 percent of firms from the Coastal Plain and Piedmont conduct presale inventories on thinnings, whereas nearly two-thirds of firms in the Mountains use inventories on these types of harvests. Fewer than 25 percent of responding foresters suggested that restrictive quotas reduced landowner revenue on pay-as-cut timber sales. Consulting firms reporting that sawtimber quotas were never a problem in their area reported at least two more sawtimber outlets than those concerned about restrictive mill quotas. Study Implications: Consulting foresters play an important role in the management of nonindustrial private forests. It is important for landowners and policymakers to understand timber sale practices employed by consulting foresters to evaluate the availability and quality of advice offered to private landowners. For foresters, this information is useful for benchmarking purposes. There are four important implications from this survey of consulting foresters in the US South. First, most consulting foresters worked on relatively small sales, indicating forest management advice is available for landowners with small parcels. Second, most consulting foresters were compensated on a commission basis. With commission rates averaging less than 10 percent, the assistance of a consulting forester should be affordable to most landowners, especially given the downside risk of selling timber without assistance from a forester. Third, consulting foresters varied their timber sale selling and payment methods based on timber sale characteristics, and their choices were consistent with previous research findings. Finally, even after market consolidation following the Great Recession, foresters reported multiple outlets for most products and received an average of four to seven bids on final harvests, indicating reasonably strong markets in most areas.

J	Prosser, L; Lane, ET; Jones, R				Prosser, Luke; Lane, Eifiona Thomas; Jones, Rebecca			Collaboration for innovative routes to market: COVID-19 and the food system	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Collaboration; Food system; Food access; COVID-19; Innovation	SUPPLY CHAINS	Y In a time of global crisis, existing systems are rigorously tested and placed under significant and abnormal strain. This paper uses Welsh case studies to explore how food producers in Wales have collaborated to protect livelihoods while also providing accessible food to the nation. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the food and drink supply chain in Wales contributed 22.1bn pound in annual turnover to the national economy and supported over 200,000 jobs. The coronavirus pandemic however has put the food and drink industry, which is considered a priority sector in Wales, at significant risk. The hospitality sector, which turned over 3 pound billion in 2019 and is a key end destination for Welsh produce from small businesses, faced months of near total closure, with no certainty of when the sector may be allowed to resume trading as normal. This in turn has significant and long-lasting effects on the country's food producers, facing a decimated sector they once relied upon to bring their produce to market though stable and established supply chains and procurement relationships. This paper explores how both producer-led and organisation-led producer collaboration in Wales has provided new and innovative routes to market for Wales' food producers as a result of the lockdown imposed by Welsh and British government to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The challenges faced by these newly established collaborations are discussed alongside the opportunities for longer term collaboration generated by these organisations which emerged to fill a specifically identified void in this unprecedented crisis. Two innovative, in depth, regional level case studies that have responded to this increased demand for accessible food are discussed. Users range from those choosing to buy local produce contact free, through an online click and collect service, to those most vulnerable, wholly reliant on a food box delivery scheme developed through cross sector collaboration at the outbreak of the crisis. This paper concludes that long term producer cooperation in the region is likely to be established following on from the short-term measures implemented as a direct result of the development of social capital during the Coronavirus lockdown, and further concludes that a crisis of this magnitude can stretch the current centralised and remotely controlled food system to breaking point. A number of lessons are highlighted which are pertinent for actions to integrate policy to support societal change and resilience, in order to prevent catastrophic food (in)access in the future.

J	Behl, A; Dutta, P				Behl, Abhishek; Dutta, Pankaj			Social and financial aid for disaster relief operations using CSR and crowdfunding Moderating effect of information quality	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Corporate social responsibility; Crowdfunding; Information quality; Disaster relief operations; Financial aid; Social aid	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; HUMANITARIAN AID; FIRM PERFORMANCE; RISK REDUCTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION; CORPORATE REPUTATION; RESPONSIBILITY CSR	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand the interlinkages between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and crowdfunding in the context of disaster relief operations (DRO). It intends to explore how information quality moderates the relationship of CSR and crowdfunding to achieve financial and social stability. The study also controls variables such as type of disaster, size of the firm and sector to which the firms belong while drawing implications. Design/methodology/approach The study collects empirical data in an Indian context through a structured questionnaire. The respondents belong to organizations which made a financial contribution toward DRO during the past decade (2008-2018). The sample size for data analysis is 232 responses belonging to different industries like plastic, chemical, textile and apparel, automotive parts and electronics, and construction. The study employs partial least squares structural equation modeling for testing the hypothesis. Findings Results indicate a positive effect of CSR activities on donation-based crowdfunding to achieve financial and social normalcy in a DRO. CSR can thus be used as an alternate way to support DRO. Results also reveal that quality of information positively impacts the relationship between crowdfunding and social aid as well as financial aid offered to the victims of the disasters. It is further observed that the type of disaster accounts for the inflow and frequency of funds made by companies as a part of their CSR activities. Research limitations/implications - The study restricts its analysis to CSR contributions made by Indian firms for DRO in an Indian context. While the study is centered in an Indian context, it holds strong implications by offering guidelines and framework for integrating funds of the government, CSR contributions of companies and donations made by citizens. The outcome also provokes thoughts on testing the results with multiple disasters across the globe in order to validate the findings and possibly extend them. Originality/value The approach of the study holds a unique slot in understanding concepts relating to CSR, crowdfunding and information science literature in the context of DRO. The study offers unique contribution in making the readers aware how CSR funds, when guided through a donation-based crowdfunding platform can help achieve social and financial aid for the victims of natural disaster.

J	Korchagov, SA; Lupanova, IN				Korchagov, S. A.; Lupanova, I. N.			Development of Forest Certification in the Vologda Region and its Role in Ensuring the Wood Felling Legality	LESNOY ZHURNAL-FORESTRY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						voluntary forest certification under the Forest Stewardship Council; timber industry complex; export of timber; illegal wood logging		The Vologda region is one of the forested regions of Russia, where the high paces of development of a timber industry complex are maintained. Forest industry in its contribution to the economy of the region occupies a leading position, behind only ferrous metallurgy and chemical industry. Timber and paper products from the Vologda region are exported to more than 50 countries of the world. The main consumers of timber - European Union countries: Finland, Estonia, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, Denmark, Belgium, Poland, Lithuania, Czech Republic. Despite the success in the forest sector of the economy, the problem of illegal cutting remains unresolved. At present it is impossible to identify areas with lack of illegal wood felling. Cases of illegal logging are not excluded on the territory of the existing network of protected territories. Illegal cutting causes material damage to the economy of the region and create the preconditions for threats to environmental security in the country as a whole. Significant volumes of illegal logging are caused by the lack of effective forest protection and proper accounting of forest management, abundant forests with unclear status, deteriorating socio-economic situation of the rural population. Unfortunately, the current Russian legislation, are not able to ensure an effective fight against illegal logging and timber turn-round. One of the directions, contributed to reduction of illegal logging, is the introduction of forest certification according to Forest Stewardship Council system. An important driving factor of the active adoption of certification in Russia was the introduction in the USA the amendments to the Lacy Law, as well as the adoption of the relevant regulations by the European Union. In the Vologda region gradually increases the area of certified forests, the amount of enterprises, certifying their supply chains. At the present time in the region is certified 2.4 million ha of forests, representing about 7 % of the area of certified forests in Russia according to the Forest Stewardship Council system. Certificates of supply chain of timber have 18 enterprises. Forestry enterprises, participating in the process of certification, confirmed the legality of the origin of timber and paper products. This allows companies to freely conduct their export activities and reduces the risk of advent of illegal origin timber on the domestic and foreign market.	[Korchagov, S. A.; Lupanova, I.

BPR Methods Applied to a Manufacturer in the Domotics Sector	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter						business process reengineering; domotic sector; supply chain management; idef methods; performance evaluation		This paper describes a company reorganization plan developed using business process reengineering (bpr) in a major enterprise operating in the domotics sector, whose core business is the manufacture of cooker top extractor hoods. In the BPR process, our attention focused on two processes that, for reasons specific to the company in question, had been pinpointed as high-priority, i.e. the design and mass production of new products and production programming. The work-up can be summarized in four main points, as follows: Delphi analysis in order to obtain individual opinions; complete analysis of the company's situation "As-Is" and preparation of IDEF0 diagrams describing the business processes; proposal of changes to the high-priority processes requiring reorganization and implementation of the new "To Be" diagrams; implementation of the new management and organizational solutions; The outcome of the As-Is phase can be translated into the definition of: a) functional relations describing the current situation, that correlate the activities forming the process in question and pinpoint the inputs, outputs, controls and resources characteristic of each activity; b) random and/or temporal sequences of the stages comprising each activity; c) performance and cost measurements; d) lists of bottlenecks and superfluous activities. After completing the analysis of the company's activities, the new network of activities was designed using the "To-Be" models. The aims of the redesign of the flow of activities were as follows: 1) to eliminate any activities that do not add value to the product/service in a manner perceptible to the customer; 2) to rationalize the essential activities, seeking to eliminate bottlenecks and reconsider the organization of actions that generate delays; 3) to make the process more flexible and adaptable, concentrating where necessary on the handling of "exceptions to the rule"; 4) to prevent the risk of errors and returns, both by ensuring the adequacy of information and by involving the end-user of the service beforehand; 5) to learn from examples of excellence, copying solutions that have already been tried and tested, and have proved effective. An Object-State Transition approach was used to generate the new "To-Be" models, focusing our attention on the objects (inputs, outputs, controls and resources) and on how they change during the processes.

Targeted evidence collection for uncertain supplier selection	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Supply chain management; Supplier selection; Uncertainty; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Multi-objective optimization	TOTAL QUANTITY DISCOUNT; ACTIVATION COSTS; RISK; DEMAND; MODEL; AHP	The problem of selecting which suppliers, and how much of different items to order from each, involves multiple, often conflicting, criteria such as costs and delivery times. Within real world multi-criteria supplier selection problems there is inherent uncertainty involved, and consideration of its impacts and mitigation is a current and important research direction going forward within the field of supplier selection. Uncertainty within multi-criteria supplier selection may be in relation to (i) a decision maker's ambiguous preferences, such as the importance between criteria, (ii) the suppliers' supply capacities of, and demand for, different items, and (iii) known information about suppliers with respect to the set of criteria, such as each supplier's delivery times or their average defect ratios. Whilst previous work has explored the first two of these, less work has explored uncertainty pertaining to information about suppliers in terms of the criteria and, specifically, how it could be efficiently reduced. Such uncertainty is an important problem to address, as it may have a large impact upon an order regarding its perceived quality compared to its realised quality, so reducing such uncertainty can have a significant impact. This paper presents a Targeted Evidence Collection (TEC) approach for efficient reduction of uncertainty, pertaining to suppliers, by looking to efficiently collect additional evidence. The approach looks to utilise and gather evidence intelligently and dynamically - by considering both the likelihood that each supplier will be part of a solution, along with a decision maker's preferences between criteria - to reduce the uncertainty and efficaciously move towards the most appropriate solution given no uncertainty. The approach is able to handle scenarios for which there are both certain and uncertain criteria present, and can take into account any number of criteria. The TEC strategy is evaluated against alternative approaches, including an active learning based approach, for varying numbers of uncertain criteria, numbers of suppliers, and variations in a decision maker's preferences. The experimentation highlights how TEC efficiently reduces uncertainty, relating to information about suppliers with respect to the set of criteria, requiring up to three times less evidence than its competitors. In this way, TEC helps to effectively mitigate the uncertainty's adverse effects, and reduce the risks inherent within a supplier selection problem. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Meanwhile, agricultural production, serving as the primary stage of biobased products, is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nutrient releases. Environmental impacts of agricultural production influenced by farming practices, soil properties, and climate conditions, are often site-specific and time dependent. Although assessing spatially and temporally explicit environmental releases and impacts are required to inform a sustainable trajectory for agricultural production, such analyses are largely lacking. This study provides site-specific analysis of on-farm and supply chain emissions from corn production to demonstrate the spatio-temporal variability of environmental impacts in the U.S. Midwest states. Using process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) and the physically-based Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agroecosystem model, we estimated county-level life cycle environmental release inventories from corn production in 12 U.S. Midwest states for the period of 2000-2008. Based on the Tool for Reduction and Assessment of Chemicals and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) impact assessment model, we quantified the corresponding life cycle global warming (GW), eutrophication (EU) and acidification (AD) impacts of corn. The results show that life cycle GW, EU and AD of corn production varied by factors of 4.2, 83.7 and 10.6, respectively, across the Midwest counties over the nine-year span (2000-2008). Life cycle GWimpacts of producing 1 kg of corn ranged from -6.4 in Franklin County, Illinois to 20.2 kg CO2-eq. in Perkins County, South Dakota. The life cycle EU impacts also spanned over a wide range of 0.99 g in Morton County, Kansas to 82.9 g N-eq. in Leelanau County, Michigan, whereas life cycle AD impacts ranged from 1.3 in Clermont County, Ohio to 100.7 g SO2-eq. in Perkins County, South Dakota. Moreover, trade-offs existed among life cycle GW, EU and AD impact categories for corn production. The spatial variation analyses showed that key contributors were the different soil types, precipitation, elevation and the amounts of fertilizers applied. These findings provided critical insight into spatio-temporal variations of life cycle environmental impacts of corn production and identified spatial hotspots and top contributors for improving environmental performances of corn production.

J	Zhao, H; Muthupandi, S; Kumara, S				Zhao, Hui; Muthupandi, Sowmyasri; Kumara, Soundar			Managing Illicit Online Pharmacies: Web Analytics and Predictive Models Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						online pharmacy; web analytics; classification; illicit online pharmacies; online traffic analysis	INTERNET; ABUSE	Background: Online pharmacies have grown significantly in recent years, from US $29.35 billion in 2014 to an expected US $128 billion in 2023 worldwide. Although legitimate online pharmacies (LOPs) provide a channel of convenience and potentially lower costs for patients, illicit online pharmacies (IOPs) open the doors to unfettered access to prescription drugs, controlled substances (eg, opioids), and potentially counterfeits, posing a dramatic risk to the drug supply chain and the health of the patient. Unfortunately, we know little about IOPs, and even identifying and monitoring IOPs is challenging because of the large number of online pharmacies (at least 30,000-35,000) and the dynamic nature of the online channel (online pharmacies open and shut down easily). Objective: This study aims to increase our understanding of IOPs through web data traffic analysis and propose a novel framework using referral links to predict and identify IOPs, the first step in fighting IOPs. Methods: We first collected web traffic and engagement data to study and compare how consumers access and engage with LOPs and IOPs. We then proposed a simple but novel framework for predicting the status of online pharmacies (legitimate or illicit) through the referral links between websites. Under this framework, we developed 2 prediction models, the reference rating prediction method (RRPM) and the reference-based K-nearest neighbor. Results: We found that direct (typing URL), search, and referral are the 3 major traffic sources, representing more than 95% traffic to both LOPs and IOPs. It is alarming to see that direct represents the second-highest traffic source (34.32%) to IOPs. When tested on a data set with 763 online pharmacies, both RRPM and R2NN performed well, achieving an accuracy above 95% in their predictions of the status for the online pharmacies. R2NN outperformed RRPM in full performance metrics (accuracy, kappa, specificity, and sensitivity). On implementing the 2 models on Google search results for popular drugs (Xanax [alprazolam], OxyContin, and opioids), they produced an error rate of only 7.96% (R2NN) and 6.20% (RRPM). Conclusions: Our prediction models use what we know (referral links) to tackle the many unknown aspects of IOPs. They have many potential applications for patients, search engines, social media, payment companies, policy makers or government agencies, and drug manufacturers to help fight IOPs. With scarce work in this area, we hope to help address the current opioid crisis from this perspective and inspire future research in the critical area of drug safety.

Growth and Survival of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella on Whole and Sliced Cucumbers	JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION			English	Article						Freezing; Pathogens; Postharvest handling; Produce; Refrigeration; Storage	ESCHERICHIA-COLI O157H7; STORAGE-TEMPERATURE; PARSLEY LEAVES; CUT CANTALOUPE; RISK-FACTORS; FRESH; HONEYDEW; BEHAVIOR; PRODUCE; SPP.	Cucumbers were associated with four multistate outbreaks of Salmonella in the United States between 2013 and 2016. This study evaluated the fate of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella on whole and sliced cucumbers at various storage temperatures. Cucumbers were inoculated with five-strain cocktails of L. monocytogenes or Salmonella, air dried, and stored at 23 +/- 2, 4 +/- 2, and -18 +/- 28 degrees C. Whole and sliced cucumber samples were enumerated on nonselective and selective media at 0, 0.21, 1, 2, 3, and 4 days (23 +/- 28 degrees C); 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days (4 +/- 28 degrees C); and 0, 7, 28, 60, 90, and 120 days (-18 +/- 28 degrees C). For Salmonella, additional time points were added at 8 and 17 h (23 +/- 28 degrees C) and at 17 h (4 +/- 28 degrees C). Population levels were calculated for whole (CFU per cucumber) and sliced (CFU per gram) cucumbers. Both pathogens grew on whole and sliced cucumbers held at ambient temperatures. At 23 +/- 28 degrees C, L. monocytogenes and Salmonella populations significantly increased on whole (2.3 and 3.4 log CFU per cucumber, respectively) and sliced (1.7 and 3.2 log CFU/g, respectively) cucumbers within 1 day. Salmonella populations significantly increased on whole and sliced cucumbers after only 5 h (2.1 log CFU per cucumber and 1.5 log CFU/g, respectively), whereas L. monocytogenes populations were not significantly different on whole and sliced cucumbers at 5 h. L. monocytogenes and Salmonella populations survived up to 21 days on refrigerated whole and sliced cucumbers. At 4 +/- 28 degrees C, L. monocytogenes populations significantly increased on whole (2.8 log CFU per cucumber) and sliced (2.9 log CFU/g) cucumbers, whereas Salmonella populations significantly decreased on whole (0.6 log CFU per cucumber) and sliced (1.3 log CFU/g) cucumbers over 21 days. Both pathogens survived on frozen whole and sliced cucumbers for at least 120 days. The ability of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella to grow on whole and sliced cucumbers in short amounts of time at ambient temperatures, and to survive on whole and sliced cucumbers past the recommended shelf life at refrigeration temperatures, highlights the need to reduce the likelihood of contamination events throughout the cucumber supply chain.

Quantitative farm-to-fork human norovirus exposure assessment of individually quick frozen raspberries and raspberry puree	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Human norovirus; Soft red fruit; Raspberry; Exposure assessment	ASYMPTOMATIC FOOD HANDLERS; REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION-PCR; URBAN SURFACE WATERS; HEPATITIS-A VIRUS; ENTERIC VIRUSES; NORWALK VIRUS; RIVER WATER; CROSS-CONTAMINATION; FELINE CALICIVIRUS; GENETIC DIVERSITY	A quantitative human norovirus (NoV) exposure model describing transmission of NOV during pre-harvest, harvest and further processing of soft red fruits exemplified by raspberries is presented. The outcomes of the model demonstrate the presence of NoV in raspberry puree or individual quick frozen (IQF) raspberry fruits and were generated by Monte Carlo simulations by combining GoldSim (R) and @Risk (R) software, Input data were collected from scientific literature, observational studies and assumptions. NoV contamination of soft red fruits is assumed to take place at farms by application of contaminated water for pesticides dilution or by berries' pickers shedding NoV. The model was built simulating that a collection center received berries from ten farms with a total of 245 food handlers picking soft red fruits during a 10-hour day shift. Given 0, 5 and 20 out of 245 berries' pickers Were shedding NoV, these conditions were calculated to result in a Mean NoV contamination of respectively 0.47, 14.1 and 36.2 NoV particles per kg raspberries in case all raspberries are mixed to one day-batch of 11 tons. The NoV contamination of the fruits was mainly driven by the route of NoV shedding food pickers (95.8%) rather than by spraying contaminated pesticide water (4.2%) (baseline scenario with 5 shedding pickers and contaminated pesticide water). Inclusion of appropriate hand washing procedures or hand washing followed by hand disinfection resulted in estimated reductions of the mean NoV levels from 14.1 to 0.16 and 0.17 NoV particles per kg raspberries, respectively, for the baseline scenario with 5 out of 245 food pickers shedding NoV. The use of a mild heat treatment (30 sat 75 degrees C) during further processing of berries to purees was noted to reduce mean NoV levels substantially from 14.1 to 0.2 NoV particles per kg raspberry puYee. For IQF raspberries, the NoV contamination is heterogeneously distributed and resulted in a mean contamination of 3.1 NoV particles per 250 g package containing approximately 115 berries. This farm-to-fork model is a useful tool for evaluating NoV mitigation strategies in the soft red fruit supply chain. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Development of a three-tier assessment model: a case study	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						AHP; Case study; TOPSIS; MCDM	CHAIN RISK-MANAGEMENT; SUPPLY CHAIN; FUZZY-AHP; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; SELECTION; RANKING	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose a three-tier assessment model (TAM), aiming to identify and evaluate the competitiveness level of companies. The existing problem is that companies find it difficult to choose a proper model which can be deployed to benchmark with competitors in terms of their competiveness level in the marketplace. Most of the available models are not appropriate or easy to use. The proposed assessment model is able to provide an insight for better planning and preparation so as to gain a better chance of success comparing with their competitors. Most importantly, the proposal model adopts a pragmatic approach and can be implemented without going through tedious mathematical calculations and analysis. Design/methodology/approach TAM embraces three different approaches deployed in various stages of the application process. The first stage is to identify the relevant criteria using hierarchical holographic modeling and the second stage is to assess the associated weightings of these criteria used to rate the potential competitiveness of related companies. The technique used in stage two is known as fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) which is a combination of two well-established methods including fuzzy logic and analytical hierarchical programming. In stage three, a technique known as technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) is adopted to benchmark the level of competitiveness covering several companies in the same industry. Findings In this paper, a case study is conducted in order to validate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed model. Results indicate that TAM can be easily applied in various industrial settings by practitioners in the field for supporting operations management practices. Research limitations/implications Significant amount of work is needed to ensure that the proposed model can be practically deployed in real industrial settings. Practical implications This proposed model is able to capitalize on the benefits of the HMM, FAHP and TOPSIS methods and offset their deficiencies. Most importantly, it can be applied to various industries without complex modification. Originality/value This paper suggests a hybrid model to assess competitiveness level embracing three different techniques with the unique feature which is able to provide an insight for better planning and preparation in order to excel competitors. Companies may be able to follow the procedures and steps suggested in the paper to implement the model which is proven to be pragmatic and can be applied in real situations.

A rapid, easy-to-perform and non-invasive method using an electronic nose (e-nose) based on metal oxide semiconductors (MOS) was developed to discriminate dry-cured meat samples in two classes based on the fungal contamination: class P (samples contaminated by OTA-producing Penicillium strains) and class NP (samples contaminated by OTA non-producing Penicillium strains). Two OTA-producing strains of Penicillium nordicum and two OTA non-producing strains of Penicillium nalgiovense and Penicillium salamii, were tested. The feasibility of this approach was initially evaluated by e-nose analysis of 480 samples of both Yeast extract sucrose (YES) and meat-based agar media inoculated with the tested Penicillium strains and incubated up to 14 days. The high recognition percentages (higher than 82%) obtained by Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA), either in calibration and cross-validation (leave-more-out approach), for both YES and meat based samples demonstrated the validity of the used approach. The e-nose method was subsequently developed and validated for the analysis of dry-cured meat samples. A total of 240 e-nose analyses were carried out using inoculated sausages, seasoned by a laboratory-scale process and sampled at 5, 7,10 and 14 days. DFA provided calibration models that permitted discrimination of dry-cured meat samples after only 5 days of seasoning with mean recognition percentages in calibration and cross-validation of 98 and 88%, respectively. A further validation of the developed e-nose method was performed using 60 dry-cured meat samples produced by an industrial-scale seasoning process showing a total recognition percentage of 73%. The pattern of volatile compounds of dry-cured meat samples was identified and characterized by a developed HS-SPME/GC-MS method. Seven volatile compounds (2-methyl-1-butanol, octane, 1R-alpha-pinene, D-limonene, undecane, tetradecanal, 9-(Z)-octadecenoic acid methyl ester) allowed discrimination between dry-cured meat samples of classes P and NP. These results demonstrate that MOS-based electronic nose can be a useful tool for a rapid screening in preventing OTA contamination in the cured meat supply chain. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In particular in the North of the country the traditional use of medicinal dates back as far as the first millennium B. C. Both healers, and the wider population, often buy their medicinal plants in local markets, but there is very little comparative information available about which plants are sold under which vernacular name at any given time, for which indication, and which dosage information and information about side effects is given by vendors. For this study we used two traditionally used species groups "Hercampuri" Gentianella spec. (Gentianaceae) and "Pasuchaca" Geranium spec. (Geraniaceae.), found in the Mercado Aviacion in Lima, as small, clearly circumscribed plant group frequently used to treat symptoms of diabetes as a test case to study the taxonomy, indications, dosage, indicated side effects, and additional species used as admixtures and hypothesized that: 1. A wide variety of different species is sold under the same common name, and often several common names exist for one species. 2. There is no consistency in the dosage, or a relationship between dosage and species marketed under one name. 3. However, there is consistency in the knowledge about usage and side effects. Methods: Surveys focusing on medicinal plants sold and their properties were conducted at the Mercado Aviacion in Lima in December 2012. Vouchers of all specimens were deposited at the National Herbarium of Peru. Results and conclusions: Our surveys in Mercado Aviacion in Lima yielded four species of Gentianella, two of Geranium, and three additional species from three genera used as common additives that were sold as anti-diabetic. These results indicate that even in case of only a few plant species, used for a very clearly circumscribed application, patients run a considerable risk when purchasing their remedies in the market. The possible side effects in this case are the more serious because diabetes has to be treated long term, and as such the patients are ingesting possible toxic remedies over a long period of time. Much more control, and a much more stringent identification of the material sold in public markets, and entering the global supply chain via internet sales, would be needed.

The recently increased attention they pay to these issues is motivated not only by a sense of social responsibility, but also by pressure from customers and competitors. In particular, the three dimensions of sustain ability based on the triple bottom line of economic, environmental and social criteria are of growing importance for sustainable supply chain management. Raw materials and their supply chains are often at the focus of attention, since manufacturers may need to diversify them for their products. Appropriate assessment models then become essential. Although raw material assessments and raw material-focused decision support schemes have recently been applied more often in the corporate context, several aspects such as indicator selection, weighting or social assessment are rarely considered. As a result, a comprehensive, sustainability-oriented raw material assessment and decision support scheme in the corporate context is not available in the scientific literature. In the design of such a scheme, four questions arise: First, how should a corporate-oriented raw material assessment model be structured? Second, how can all three sustainability dimensions be taken into account? Third, how can the application of raw material assessments in a corporate-oriented decision-making process increase the sustainability level of a company? And fourth, does a methodically structured raw material assessment model have advantages over existing models? To answer these questions, we have developed a model which takes into account state-of-the-art sustainability assessments as well as recent developments in the field of criticality analysis, life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) and social life cycle assessment (SLCA). With partners from both academia and industry we identify relevant quantitative indicators for structuring the assessment model and for calculating corresponding indicator weightings, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). To demonstrate the applicability of the assessment model for decision support and its benefits for companies in identifying potential hotspots in raw material supply chains, we present a case study that includes decision support for selecting capacitor technologies. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness of the assessments. In short, this article presents a sustainability-oriented raw material assessment and decision support model and proposes how it should be applied in a corporate context. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Tip, B; Vos, FGS; Peters, E; Delke, V				Tip, Barbara; Vos, Frederik Guido Sebastiaan; Peters, Esmee; Delke, Vincent			A Kraljic and competitive rivalry perspective on hospital procurement during a pandemic (COVID-19): a Dutch case study	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Pandemic; COVID-19; Factor market rivalry; Hospital procurement; Kraljic; Purchasing portfolio model; Kraljic matrix	PURCHASING PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT; BUYER-SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS; FACTOR-MARKET RIVALRY; RED-QUEEN; ORGANIZATION; IMPLEMENTATION; DESIGN; CARE	Purpose - Procurement professionals widely use purchasing portfolio models to tailor purchasing strategies to different product groups needs. However, the application of these approaches in hospitals and the impact of a pandemic shock remain largely unknown. This paper aims to assess hospital purchasers' procurement strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of factor-market rivalry (FMR) on strategies and the effectiveness of purchasing portfolio categorizations in this situation. Design/methodology/approach - This qualitative study of hospital purchasing in the Netherlands is supported by secondary data from official government publications. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 hospital purchasers at large hospitals. An interpretative approach is used to analyze the interviews and present the results. Findings - The findings reveal that product scarcity forces purchasers to treat them as (temporary) bottleneck items at the hospital level. The strategies adopted largely aligned with expected behavior based on Kraljic's commodity management model. Adding the FMR perspective to the model helped to further cluster crisis strategies into meaningful categories. Besides inventory management, increasing supply, reducing demand and increasing resource coordination were the other common strategies. An important finding is that purchasers and governments serve as gatekeepers in channeling FMR, thereby reducing potential harmful competition between and within hospitals. Social implications - The devastating experience of the COVID-19 pandemic is unveiling critics' weaknesses of public health-care provision in times of Crisis. This study assesses the strategies hospital purchasers apply to counteract shortages in the supply chain. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of gatekeepers in times of crisis and present strategies purchases can take to assure the supply of resources. Originality/value - No research has been conducted on purchasing portfolio models and FMR implications for hospitals during pandemics. Therefore, the authors offer several insights: increasing the supply risk creates temporary bottleneck strategies, letting purchasers adopt a short-terse perspetive and emphasizing the high mobility of commodities in the Kraljic commodity matrix. Additionally, despite more collaboration uncovered in other studies regarding COVID-19, strong rivalry arose at the beginning of the pandemic, leading to increased competition and less collaboration. Given such increased FMR, procurement managers and governments become important gatekeepers to balance resource allocation during pandemics both within and between hospitals.

Its objective is to map changes at individual consumer level and identify the influence of different factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic on changes in individual food consumption. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey among 2,680 residents of Denmark (DK), Germany (DE), and Slovenia (SI) using quota sampling for gender, age and regional distribution. Data on consumption frequencies before and during the pandemic were collected with a food frequency questionnaire in the spring of 2020 (during the first lockdown period) for important types of fresh food and non-perishable food. Our results showed that, depending on the type of food, 15-42% of study participants changed their consumption frequency during the pandemic, compared to before. In all the study countries, the food categories with the highest rates of change were frozen food, canned food, and cake and biscuits; among the food categories with lower rates of change were bread, alcoholic drinks, and dairy products. People across all three countries shopped less frequently during lockdown and there was an overall reduction in the consumption of fresh foods, but an increase in the consumption of food with a longer shelf life in Denmark and Germany. Interestingly though, we observed diverging trends in all food categories analyzed, with some people decreasing and others increasing their consumption frequencies, demonstrating that the pandemic had different impacts on people's lifestyles and food consumption patterns. Using the method of multinomial regression analysis, we identified factors significantly (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, p < 0.1) related to increases and decrease in individuals' consumption frequencies in different food categories. The factors include restrictions put in place in response to the pandemic (i.e., closure of physical workplaces, canteens, cafes and restaurants, schools, and childcare institutions), changes in households' grocery shopping frequency, individuals' perceived risk of COVID-19, income losses due to the pandemic, and socio-demographic factors. Interesting differences between the countries were detected, allowing insights into the different food cultures. Conclusions include implications for policy-makers and actors in the food supply chain on the issues of healthy diets, food system resilience, and behavior change.

J	Sabet, E; Yazdani, B; Kian, R; Galanakis, K				Sabet, Ehsan; Yazdani, Baback; Kian, Ramez; Galanakis, Kostas			A strategic and global manufacturing capacity management optimisation model: A Scenario-based multi-stage stochastic programming approach	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Stochastic programming; Optimisation modelling; Capacity management; Manufacturing	SUPPLY CHAIN DESIGN; FACILITY LOCATION; UNCERTAIN DEMAND; RISK-MANAGEMENT; EXPANSION; ALLOCATION; NETWORK; TECHNOLOGY; DECISIONS; ACQUISITION	Large-scale multinational manufacturing firms often require a significant investment in production capacity and extensive management efforts in strategic planning in an uncertain business environment. In this research we first discuss what decision terms and boundary conditions a holistic capacity management model for the manufacturing industry must contain. To better understand how these decision terms and constraints have been employed by the recent model developers in the area of capacity and resource management modelling for manufacturing, 69 optimisation-based (deterministic and stochastic) models have been carefully selected from 2000 to 2018 for a brief comparative analysis. The results of this comparison shows although applying uncertainty into capacity modelling (in stochastic form) has received a greater deal of attention most recently (since 2010), the existing stochastic models are yet very simplistic, and not all the strategic terms have been employed in the current model developments in the field. This lack of a holistic approach although is evident in deterministic models too, the existing stochastic counterparts proved to include much less decision terms and inclusive constraints, which limits them to a limited applications and may cause sub-optimal solutions. Employing this set of holistic decision terms and boundary conditions, this work develops a scenario-based multi-stage stochastic capacity management model, which is capable of modelling different strategic terms such as capacity level management (slight, medium and large capacity volume adjustment to increase/decrease capacity), location/relocation decisions, merge decomposition options, and product management (R&D, new product launch, productto-plant and product-to-market allocation, and product phase-out management). Possibility matrix, production rates, different financial terms and international taxes, inflation rates, machinery depreciation, investment lead-time and product cycle-time are also embedded in the model in order to make it more practical, realistic and sensitive to strategic decisions and scenarios. A step-by-step open-box validation has been followed while designing the model and a holistic black-box validation plan has been designed and employed to widely validate the model. The model then has been verified by deploying a real-scaled case of Toyota Motors UK (TMUK) decision of mothballing one of their production lines in the UK after the global recession in 2010.

J	de Paula, LB; Gil-Lafuente, AM				Barcellos de Paula, Luciano; Gil-Lafuente, Anna Maria			Algorithm applied in corporate sustainability	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Innovation; CSR; Corporate sustainability; Stakeholder engagement; Fuzzy subsets	STAKEHOLDER THEORY; FUZZY; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; IDENTIFICATION; METHODOLOGY; INDICATORS; STRATEGIES; ANALYTICS; QUALITY	Purpose Scientific studies indicate that stakeholder's engagement is a key factor for the creation of sustainable value in companies. This paper aims to evaluate the sustainability of a sports company and propose a tool to prioritize the relevant issues that this company should consider in its operations. Design/methodology/approach Stakeholder theory and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) are considered, and, from the Fuzzy Logic, the paper proposes a decision-making tool to establish the relevant issues. The "Experton Method" is used in this paper. Findings The algorithm used can help decision makers in processes that include the stakeholder's opinions. In this case, a tool that treats qualitative data in a reliable manner is required. The methodology used allowed knowing the stakeholders expectations and to define priorities in sustainability issues. The results were captured in a materiality matrix. The manuscript concludes that including stakeholders in the decision-making process, the company generates trust and legitimacy of its stakeholders. This participatory approach and the use of algorithm help companies in materiality assessment, definition of priority issues and management of resources. Practical implications In terms of managerial implications, this paper presents a useful tool that can help entrepreneurs in the decision-making to manage their suppliers. Using an algorithm of fuzzy logic applied in the supply chain management, it is indicated how to set priorities to build a consistent corporate social responsibility (CSR) plan to achieve corporation success. This methodology allows reducing subjectivity; it generates greater precision and decreases the risk in decision-making. At the same time, it promotes dialogue and collaboration among stakeholders to create value for stakeholders and CSR, and collaborate to have a responsible company performance. Furthermore, this paper provides theoretical applications in terms of the literature review on corporate sustainability, indicating that companies must consider the stakeholder's engagement in its strategies. Based on the bibliometric study, there are knowledge gaps on the subject. For these reasons, an important contribution is observed at the academic level that allows expanding the frontier of knowledge on the subject. Originality/value A tool for decision-making is presented with great utility for entrepreneurs in the processes of dialogue and stakeholder's engagement, being a contribution for the creation of sustainable value. In addition, there is an important scientific contribution because the paper identifies in the literature the knowledge gaps on the subject.

It is one of a set of papers examining the project, including companion papers that describe innovations in the mass timber design process and the impact of these innovations on construction performance. The focus of this paper is on innovation in the construction phase and its relationship to innovations implemented in previous project phases. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method, longitudinal case study approach was used in this research project to investigate and document the Tallwood House project over a three-year period. Both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis techniques were used. Members of the research team observed prefabrication and construction, conducted periodic interviews and reviewed project artefacts. Findings The research identified three innovation "clusters," including the use of innovative tools, techniques and strategies in the design and construction processes and the role they played in delivering the project. The "clusters" were further characterized according to the type of "connectivity" they afforded, either facilitation, operationalization or materialization. These two perspectives support a compounding view on innovation and help to understand how it can flow throughout a project's life cycle and across its supply chain. Three process-based innovations were initiated during the design phase, integrated design process, building information modeling and virtual design and construction and flowed through to the construction phase. These were seen to enable the creation of connections that were crucial to the overall success of the project. These innovations were operationalized and enacted through the construction phase as design for manufacturing and assembly and prefabrication, staged construction and just-in-time delivery, integration of safety and risk management and a rigorous quality control and quality assurance process. Finally, a full-scale mock-up was produced for practice and constructability assessment, materializing the radical product innovation that was the mass timber structure. These strategies are used together for a synergistic and integrated approach to increase productivity, expedite the construction schedule and develop an innovative building product. Originality/value This paper details an in-depth investigation into the diffusion dynamics of multiple systemic innovations for the construction process of a unique building project, the tools and techniques used by the construction manager and team, and the challenges, solutions and lessons learned.

Estimating the Potential for Conservation and Farming in the Amazon and Cerrado under Four Policy Scenarios	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Brazil; Amazon; Cerrado; Forest Code; supply chain; soy moratorium; cattle agreements	BRAZIL FOREST CODE; LAND-COVER; DEFORESTATION; CARBON; RISK; END	Since 2013, clearing rates have rapidly increased in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. This acceleration has raised questions about the efficacy of current regional public and private conservation policies that seek to promote agricultural production while conserving remnants of natural vegetation. In this study, we assessed conservation and agricultural outcomes of four potential policy scenarios that represent perfect adherence to private sector, zero-deforestation commitments (i.e., the Amazon soy moratorium-ASM and the Amazon cattle agreements-CA) and to varying levels of implementation of the Brazilian Forest Code (FC). Under a zero-clearing scenario, we find that the extent of croplands as of 2017 within the two biomes (31 MHa) could double without further clearing if agriculture were to expand on all previously cleared land that is suitable for crops. Moreover, at least 47 MHa of land that is already cleared but unsuitable for crops would remain available for pasture. Under scenarios in which only legal clearing under the FC could occur, 51 MHa of additional natural vegetation could be cleared. This includes as many as 1 MHa of nonforest vegetation that could be cleared in the Amazon biome without triggering the ASM and CA monitoring systems. Two-thirds of the total vegetation vulnerable to legal clearing is located within the Cerrado biome, and 19 MHa of this land is suitable for cropland expansion. Legal clearing of all of these areas could reduce biodiversity persistence by 4% within the two biomes, when compared with the zero-clearing scenario, and release up to 9 PgCO(2)e, with the majority (75%) coming from the Cerrado biome. However, when we considered the potential outcomes of full implementation of the FC, we found that 22% (11 MHa) of the 51 MHa of vegetation subject to legal clearing could be protected through the environmental quotas market, while an additional 1 MHa should be replanted across the two biomes, predominantly in the Amazon biome (73% of the area subject to replanting). Together, quotas and replanting could prevent the release of 2 PgCO(2)e that would otherwise be emitted if all legal clearing occurred. Based on our results, we conclude that ongoing legal clearing could create additional space for cropland and cattle production beyond the substantial existing stocks of cleared areas but would significantly impair local carbon and biodiversity stocks.

Geology, market and supply chain of niobium and tantalum-a review	MINERALIUM DEPOSITA			English	Article						Niobium; Tantalum; Rare-elements; Strategic metals; Pyrochlore; Columbite; Tantalite	ELEMENT GRANITIC PEGMATITES; LAKE PERALKALINE COMPLEX; STRANGE LAKE; ALKALINE COMPLEX; U-PB; HYDROTHERMAL PROCESSES; KOLA-PENINSULA; SR ISOTOPE; CHEMICAL EVOLUTION; ECONOMIC GEOLOGY	Tantalum (Ta) and niobium (Nb) are essential metals in modern society. Their use in corrosion prevention, micro-electronics, specialty alloys and high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steel earns them a strategic designation in most industrialised countries. The Ta market is unstable due in part to historic influx of 'conflict' columbite-tantalite concentrate, or "Coltan," that caused Ta mines in Australia and Canada to be placed on care and maintenance. More recently, the growing appetite of modern society for consumer goods made of 'conflict-free' minerals or metals has put pressure on suppliers. Pegmatites, rare-element-enriched granites, related placer deposits and weathered crusts overlying carbonatite and peralkaline complexes account for the majority of Ta production. Several carbonatite-related deposits (e.g. Upper Fir and Crevier, Canada) are being considered for potential co-production of Ta and Nb. Pyrochlore (Nb-Ta), columbite-tantalite (Nb-Ta), wodginite (Ta, Nb and Sn) and microlite (Ta and Nb) are the main ore minerals. Approximately 40% of Ta used in 2012 came from Ta mines, 30 % from recycling, 20 % from tin slag refining and 10 % from secondary mine concentrates. Due to rapid industrialisation and increased use of Nb in steel making in countries such as China and India, demand for Nb is rising. Weathered crusts overlying carbonatite complexes in Brazil and one hard rock carbonatite deposit in Canada account for about 92 and 7 % of Nb world mine production, respectively. Since the bulk of the production is geographically and politically restricted to a single country, security of supply is considered at risk. Other prospective resources of Nb, beside carbonatites and associated weathered crusts, are peralkaline complexes (e.g. Nechalacho; where Nb is considered as a potential co-product of REE and zirconium). Economically, significant deposits of Ta and Nb contain pyrochlore, columbite-tantalite, fersmite, loparite and struverite. Assuming continued elasticity of Ta and Nb prices and that the law of the supply and demand applies, new sources of these metals can be developed. In the long term, there is no need to worry about Ta and Nb availability. Temporary disruptions in Ta and Nb supply are possible and could be difficult to cope with, so new sources of supply may be developed to diversify geographic sources of supply for strategic reasons.

Quantifying the social equity state of an energy system: environmental and labor market equity of the shale gas boom in Appalachia	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						energy systems; natural gas; equity; air quality; climate change; labor markets	FOSSIL-FUEL; MARCELLUS; JUSTICE; IMPACTS; EMPLOYMENT; EMISSIONS; INCOME; RISKS	A fundamental societal concern in energy system transitions is the distribution of benefits and costs across populations. A recent transition, the US shale gas boom, has dramatically altered the domestic energy outlook and global markets; however, the social equity implications have not been meaningfully assessed and accounted for in public and private decision making. In this study, we develop and demonstrate a systematic approach to quantify the multi-dimensional equity state of an energy system, with a focus on the shale gas boom in the Appalachian basin. We tailor variants of standard equity metrics as well as develop new empirical and analytical methods and metrics to assess spatial, temporal, income, and racial equity as it relates to air quality, climate change, and labor market impacts across the natural gas supply chain. We find moderate to high spatial inequities with respect to the distribution of production (Gini coefficient (y) = 0.93), consumption for electric power generation (77 = 0.68), commercial, industrial, and residential end use (77 = 0.72), job creation (77 = 0.72), and air pollution-related deaths (77 = 0.77), which are largely driven by geographicallyfixed natural gas abundance and demand. Air quality impacts are also regressive, such that mortality risk induced by natural gas activity generally increases as income decreases; for example, mortality risk (m) (in units of premature mortality per 100 000 people) for the lowest income class (<$15 000; m = 0.22 in 2016) is higher (18%-31%) than for the highest income class (>$150 000; m = 0.27 in 2016). These risks are higher for white (m = 0.30 in 2016) than non-white (m = 0.16 in 2016) populations, which is largely a result of the demographics of rural communities within the vicinity of natural gas development. With respect to local labor market impacts within producing counties, we find marginal declines in income inequality (2.8% 1.0%) and poverty rates (9.9% 1.7%) during the boom, although household income increases for the wealthiest and decreases for the poorest. At a systems-level, there is an implied air quality-employment tradeoff of 3 (<1 to 7) job-years created per life-year lost; this tradeoff varies spatially (-1100 to 4400 life-years lost minus job-years created), wherein the job benefit outweighs the air quality costs in most producing counties whereas in all other counties the reverse is true. We also observe temporal inequities, with air quality and employment impacts following the boom-and-bust cycle, while climate impacts are largely borne by future generations. Cross-impact elasticities (c), which measure the sensitivity between different types of impacts, reveal that employment increases are sensitive to and coupled with increases in air and climate impacts (c = 1.1 and c = 1.3, respectively). The metrics applied here facilitate the evaluation and design of countervailing policies and systems that explicitly account for social inequities mediated through energy infrastructure, supply, and demand. For example, in future energy system transition, such equity metrics can be used to facilitate decisions related to the siting oflow-carbon infrastructure such as transmission lines and wind turbines and the phase -out of fossil fuel infrastructure, as well as to demonstrate changes in distributional tradeoffs such as the decoupling of environmental and employment effects.

Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in Africa are disproportionately affected by HIV infections because of cultural, structural, biological, and behavior factors. Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), as a highly potent and recommended discreet user-controlled HIV prevention strategy, has the potential to substantially reduce new HIV infections in African women if delivered with high coverage and if used with sufficient adherence. However, data are limited on "real-world" implementation approaches to efficiently reach at-risk women who may benefit from PrEP. Family planning (FP) clinics provide care to young women at risk for acquiring HIV and have in-built staffing, supply chain, and HIV testing access, which could contribute to more efficient PrEP implementation with less cost, but no study has evaluated this model in "real-world" settings. What did the researchers do and find? We conducted a pilot open-label, "real-world" implementation program to evaluate the feasibility of integrating PrEP delivery into routine FP clinics to reach HIV at-risk young women. General-population women accessing FP services were universally screened for HIV behavior risk factors and were counseled for PrEP by program-dedicated nurses embedded in 8 public health FP clinics in a high-HIV-prevalence region in Kenya. We found that FP clinics can be an effective platform to efficiently reach HIV at-risk women who may benefit from PrEP. PrEP screening was feasible, and 22% of the general population of women took PrEP home. There was a high drop-off in early PrEP continuation (41% PrEP continuation at 1 month) particularly among AGYW <24 years old, but a subset of women persisted on PrEP (25% at month 3 and 15% at month 6), with higher continuation among women with HIV-positive partners, possibly indicating further reflection or decision-making on PrEP use. Women's perceived risk for HIV, including having an HIV-positive partner, was an important driver of initiation and continuation on PrEP. What do these findings mean? To our knowledge, this project provides the first demonstration of "real-world" delivery of PrEP for at-risk AGYW integrated into FP clinics in Africa, a priority population for HIV prevention. These findings demonstrate that it may be feasible to integrate PrEP delivery in public health FP clinics, making this a platform potential "one-stop" location for FP and PrEP. With expanding PrEP awareness, uptake and continuation are likely to increase among women at risk. Evidence from this work will inform next steps for wider delivery of PrEP and next-generation PrEP formulations (e.g., multipurpose HIV prevention and contraception technologies) in FP clinics, not only in Kenya but in other resource-limited settings globally. Background Young women account for a disproportionate fraction of new HIV infections in Africa and are a priority population for HIV prevention, including implementation of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The overarching goal of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating PrEP delivery within routine family planning (FP) clinics to serve as a platform to efficiently reach at-risk adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) for PrEP in HIV high-burden settings. Methods and findings The PrEP Implementation in Young Women and Adolescents (PrIYA) program is a real-world implementation program to demonstrate integration of PrEP delivery for at-risk AGYW in FP clinics in Kisumu, Kenya. Between November 2017 and June 2018, women aged 15 to 45 from the general population seeking FP services at 8 public health clinics were universally screened for HIV behavioral risk factors and offered PrEP following national PrEP guidelines. We evaluated PrEP uptake and continuation, and robust Poisson regression methods were used to identify correlates of uptake and early continuation of PrEP, with age included as a one-knot linear spline. Overall, 1,271 HIV-uninfected women accessing routine FP clinics were screened for PrEP; the median age was 25 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 22-29), 627 (49%) were <24 years old, 1,026 (82%) were married, more than one-third (34%) had partners of unknown HIV status, and the vast majority (n = 1,200 [94%]) reported recent condom-less sex. Of 1,271 women screened, 278 (22%) initiated PrEP, and 114 (41%) returned for at least one refill visit after initiation. PrEP uptake was independently associated with reported male-partner HIV status (HIV-positive 94%, unknown 35%, HIV-negative 8%; p < 0.001) and marital status (28% unmarried versus married 21%; p = 0.04), and a higher proportion of women >= 24 years (26%; 191/740) initiated PrEP compared to 16% (87/531) of young women <24 years (p < 0.001). There was a moderate and statistically non-significant unadjusted increase in PrEP uptake among women using oral contraception pills (OCPs) compared to women using injectable or long-acting reversible contraception methods (OCP 28% versus injectable/implants/intrauterine devices [IUDs] 18%; p = 0.06). Among women with at least one post-PrEP initiation follow-up visit (n = 278), no HIV infection was documented during the project period. Overall, continuation of PrEP use at 1, 3, and 6 months post initiation was 41%, 24%, and 15%, respectively. The likelihood for early continuation of PrEP use (i.e., return for at least one PrEP refill within 45 days post initiation) was strongly associated with reported male-partner HIV status (HIV-positive 67%, -negative 39%, unknown 31%; overall effect p = 0.001), and a higher proportion of women >= 24 years old continued PrEP at 1 month compared with young women <24 years old (47% versus 29%; p = 0.002). For women >= 24 years old, the likelihood to continue PrEP use at 1 month post initiation increased by 3% for each additional year of a woman's age (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.05; p = 0.01). In contrast, for women <24 years old, the likelihood of continuing PrEP for each additional year of a woman's age was high in magnitude (approximately 6%) but statistically non-significant (adjusted PR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.97-1.16; p = 0.18). Frequently reported reasons for discontinuing PrEP were low perceived risk of HIV (25%), knowledge that partner was HIV negative (24%), experiencing side effects (20%), and pill burden (17%). Study limitations include lack of qualitative work to provide insights into women's decision-making on PrEP uptake and continuation, the small number of measured covariates imposed by the program data, and a nonrandomized design limiting definitive ascertainment of the robustness of a PrEP-dedicated nurse-led implementation strategy. Conclusions In this real-world PrEP implementation program in Kenya, integration of universal screening and counseling for PrEP in FP clinics was feasible, making this platform a potential "one-stop" location for FP and PrEP. There was a high drop-off in PrEP continuation, but a subset of women continued PrEP use at least through 1 month, possibly indicating further reflection or decision-making on PrEP use. Greater efforts to support PrEP normalization and persistence for African women are needed to help women navigate their decisions about HIV prevention preferences as their reproductive goals and HIV vulnerability evolve.

J	Barbieri, P; Ciabuschi, F; Fratocchi, L; Vignoli, M				Barbieri, Paolo; Ciabuschi, Francesco; Fratocchi, Luciano; Vignoli, Matteo			What do we know about manufacturing reshoring?	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC SOURCING			English	Article						Qualitative; Manufacturing; Internationalization; Offshoring; Literature review; Reshoring	SUPPLY CHAIN; LOCATION DECISION; OUTSOURCING DECISIONS; FUTURE-RESEARCH; IMPACT; INDUSTRY; PERSPECTIVE; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION	Purpose - The aim of this paper is to analyze and classify research that has been conducted on manufacturing reshoring, i.e. the decision to bring back to the home country production activities earlier offshored, independently of the governance mode (insourcing vs outsourcing). Consequently, the paper also aims at providing avenues for future research and to highlight the distinct value of studying manufacturing reshoring either per se or in combination with other constructs of the international business tradition. Design/methodology/approach - A set of 57 carefully selected articles on manufacturing reshoring published in international journals or books indexed on Scopus in the past 10 years was systematically analyzed based on the "5Ws and 1H" (who-what-where-when-why and how) set of questions. Findings - The authors' work shows a certain convergence among authors regarding what reshoring is and what its key features and motivations are. In contrast, other related aspects, such as the decision-making and implementation processes, are comparatively less understood. Research limitations/implications - As manufacturing reshoring is a "recent" topic, for some of its aspects, only exploratory research is available to date, limiting the authors' possibility to either characterize it in a more exhaustive way or highlight well-established patterns. Practical implications - The paper demonstrates that studying reshoring will indeed contribute to expanding our understanding of internationalization processes and strategies in general and of production internationalization specifically. While past studies have argued that the learning derived from international experience would permit firms to overcome their unfamiliarity with new business environments, reshoring might show that this outcome is not necessarily certain. Rather, firms might not be able to overcome obstacles because of internationalization or they might realize that attempting to do so is not desirable, e.g. because of excessive risk or changes in the firm's strategic priorities. Social implications - From a societal point of view, the present research underlines that reshoring can be part of that re-industrialization policy that many Western countries include in their economic agenda - yet, its impact on employment should not be overestimated, as often relocation is only in regard to some product lines. At the same time, there might be an intimate relationship between reshoring and the various forms of technological innovations applied to manufacturing - which has become popularly labeled as "Industry 4.0". Originality/value - Literature reviews proposed until now usually paid almost exclusive attention to motivations driving this phenomenon. This paper offers a broader and more comprehensive examination of the extant knowledge of manufacturing reshoring and identifies the main unresolved issues and knowledge gaps, which future research should investigate.

In the United States (US), public policies and corporate decisions have prompted a wave of proposals for new gathering and transmission pipelines in recent years, raising the question: Who bears the burdens associated with the existing pipeline infrastructure in the US? With this in mind, we examined the density of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines in the US, together with county-level data on social vulnerability. For the 2,261 US counties containing natural gas pipelines, we found a positive correlation between county-level pipeline density and an index of social vulnerability. In general, counties with more socially vulnerable populations have significantly higher pipeline densities than counties with less socially vulnerable populations. In particular, counties in the top quartile of social vulnerability tend to have pipeline densities that are much higher than pipeline densities for counties in the bottom quartile of social vulnerability. The difference grows larger for counties at the upper extremes of pipeline density within each group. We discuss some of the implications for the indigenous communities and others affected by recent expansions of oil and gas infrastructure. We offer recommendations aimed at improving ways in which decision-makers identify and address the societal impacts and environmental justice implications of midstream pipeline infrastructure. Plain Language Summary Recent years have seen a wave of oil and gas development in the United States (US) and elsewhere. Research on human health and other societal impacts of oil and gas focus mainly on upstream activities, such as hydraulic fracturing, and on downstream activities, such as refining and electricity production. Gathering and transmission pipelines, which connect upstream and downstream parts of the supply chain, also have negative impacts, but receive less attention than other areas. No prior research has determined whether the negative impacts of gathering and transmission pipelines fall equitably across society. We analyzed publicly available data sets and found that the existing network of natural gas pipelines in the US is concentrated more heavily in counties where people experience high levels of social vulnerability than in counties where social vulnerability is low. These results have implications for environmental justice, which is concerned, in part, with how environmental burdens are distributed throughout the society. We highlight some of the burdens faced by indigenous peoples and others who are impacted by the ongoing pipeline development.

Specifically, it investigates the factors driving the procurement practices of exporter of fresh fruits and vegetables in sub-Saharan Africa, and specifically sourcing from smallholders. A survey is undertaken of exporters of fresh fruit and vegetables in sub-Saharan Africa. The resulting data are used to estimate econometrically the propensity of exporters to source from smallholders, and the intensity of sourcing among those exporters who do procure from smallholders. Explanatory variables include firm and market characteristics, supply chain costs, type of product, availability of alternative sources of supply, and judgments regarding the performance of smallholders and other sources of supply. The propensity to procure from smallholders is found to be negatively associated with being a small exporter and the performance of medium- and large-scale producers. Exporters are more likely to source from smallholders if they have their own production capacity and smallholders are judged to perform well. The requirement of customers to comply with private food safety standards is found to have no significant effect on the propensity to procure from smallholders. Conversely, compliance with private standards has a strong influence on the intensity of sourcing from smallholders. Exporters judging smallholders to perform well are more likely to source intensively from smallholders, but to source less if they judge their own production to perform well. High fixed costs tend to be associated with lower intensity of sourcing from smallholders. The results suggest that compliance with private food safety standards does not drive the exclusion of smallholders from export value chains; indeed, conversely, the requirement to comply with such standards is associated with greater intensity of sourcing from smallholders. Smallholders evidently play a key role in the defrayment of risk by exporters in that many exporters combine their own production with smallholder procurement. Costs of procurement from smallholders, however, remain an issue. Evidently, the fixed costs of smallholder supply chains increase appreciably with the intensity of sourcing. The research reported here provides a new perspective on the inclusion of smallholders in export value chains for horticultural products. The incorporation of smallholders into these value chains is seen as the outcome of the procurement decisions of exporters. Contrary to much of the discourse in this area, the results suggest that smallholders can and do compete in export value chains for horticultural products even in the context of exacting food safety standards.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a methodology capable of guiding prudent and successful investment in the IoT. The paper identifies enabling conditions to maximize the success of IoT security innovation adoption projects in Italian banks. Design/methodology/approach The methodology proposed is constructed from two key sources: first a literature review and second through impressions gleaned from an informal survey and in-depth interviews with a sample of convenience of six managers of Italian bank security systems. A key purpose of the literature review is to identify enabling conditions for a successful IT innovation adoption project which is then synthesized into an "innovation adoption model" capable of illustrating an IoT adoption decision. Second, the authors identify business process reengineering (BPR) steps required to establishing an appropriate organizational and technical framework to successfully undertake the adoption of the IoT for bank physical security purposes. The resulting methodology refers to a typical BPR project approached from an information system development perspective capable of fusing IoT services with human-based services at best performance values. Findings The literature review and proposed BPR framework give indications of possible support for the conclusion that the banking sector is ready for the IoT innovations and transformation of traditional bank branch worksites into smart environments. The tentative nature of these findings give sufficient justification for trialing the IoT for banking physical security by introducing an Intelligent Protection System to manage security management processes. Although the authors do not generalize the findings from examining the Italian banking security system, the literature review and the paucity of studies available encourages us to investigate the use of the IoT for bank physical security more broadly. Originality/value Adoption of the IoT represents the third wave of IT-driven competition and introduces a methodology applicable to the security domain which represents, globally, an area that is becoming a domain of major economic and social concern. The IoT adoption model proposed reflects the current state of knowledge in the field and could be extended to other organizational at-risk areas requiring continuity of highly effective protection. The authors are encouraged by the results that indicate a high likelihood of success to trial an IoT introduction to banking security.

Aspergillus penicillioides differentiation and cell division at 0.585 water activity	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							TREHALOSE-BASED OLIGOSACCHARIDES; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; ENVIRONMENTAL-CONDITIONS; CONIDIAL GERMINATION; COMPATIBLE SOLUTES; DORMANT CONIDIA; GLYCEROL UPTAKE; FUNGI; STRESS; LIFE	Water availability acts as the most stringent constraint for life on Earth. Thus, understanding the water relations of microbial extremophiles is imperative to our ability to increase agricultural productivity (e.g., by enhancing the processing and turnover of dead organic matter in soils of arid regions), reduce human exposure to mycotoxins in buildings and our food-supply chain, prevent the spoilage of foods/animal feeds, books, museum specimens and artworks and better control microbiology of industrial fermentations. Only a small number of microbial systems can retain activity at <0.710 water activity (ISME J 2015 9: 1333-1351). It has long-been considered that the most resilient of these is Xeromyces bisporus, which inhabits sugar-rich substrates (Appl Environ Microbiol 1968 16: 1853-1858). The current study focused on germination of Aspergillus penicillioides, a xerophile which is also able to grow under low humidity and saline conditions. Investigations of germination differed from those reported earlier: firstly, aerially borne conidia were harvested, and then used for inoculations, in their dry condition; secondly, cultures were incubated at 24 degrees C, i.e. below optimum germination temperature, to minimize the possibility of water loss from the substrate; thirdly, cultures remained sealed throughout the 73-day study period (microscopic examination was carried out directly 48 through the Petri plate lid); fourthly, the germination parameters determined were: rates and extent of conidial swelling, production of differentiated germination-structures and septate germlings, and subsequent development of mycelium and/or sporulation; fifthly, assessments were carried out over a range of water-activity values and time points to obtain a complete profile of the germination process. Conidia swelled, formed differentiated germination-structures and then produced septate germlings at a water-activity of just 0.585 (58.5% relative humidity), outside the currently understood thermodynamic window for life. Furthermore, analyses of these data suggest a theoretical water-activity minimum of 0.565 for germination of A. penicilliodes. In relation to astrobiology, these findings have an application in understanding the limits to life in extraterrestrial environments. In light of current plans for exploration missions to Mars and other places, and the need to safeguard martian scientific sites and potential resources (including water) for future human habitation, a knowledge-based and effective policy for planetary protection is essential. As it is, Mars-bound spacecraft may frequently be contaminated with aspergilli (including A. penicillioides) and other organisms which, when transported to other planetary bodies, pose a contamination risk. In crafting countermeasures to offset this, it is important to know as precisely as possible the capabilities of these potential interplanetary visitors.

By means of an inventory snapshot of all pre-packed refrigerated food products (n = 1477), including a wide range of fresh-cut vegetables, smoked fish, meat and dairy products, from four different supermarket chains in Belgium, the use and consistency in use of shelf life labels (i.e. 'use by' and 'best before' dates) within food product categories and supermarkets was investigated. In addition, recommended storage conditions were noted and by means of a challenge test on a randomly selected cooked pork meat product the impact of storage temperature (4 degrees C, 7 degrees C and 10 degrees C) and validity of the set shelf life (13 days) and shelf life label (a 'best before' date) was evaluated. It was noted that a mixed use of the 'use by' and 'best before' dates and recommended storage conditions occurs in most refrigerated food product categories except for smoked fish for which on all product brands (including private labels and premium brands) at all retailers a 'use by' data and storage at 4 degrees C was recommended. The inconsistency of shelf life labels and storage conditions within a food product category is to some extent expected as product characteristics and packaging and storage conditions will impact on microbial quality and safety such as growth potential of Listeria monocytogenes. Still a mixed use will detract from consumers' understanding of the shelf life label and contribute to food waste. In addition, recommended storage conditions were noted and by means of a challenge test with L. monocytogenes on a randomly selected cooked pork meat product the impact of storage temperature (4 degrees C, 7 degrees C and 10 degrees C) and validity of the set shelf life (13 days) and shelf life label (a 'best before' date) was evaluated. Challenge testing indicated substantial growth potential of L. monocytogenes (on average +1.0, +2.0 and +4.0 log CFU/g respectively at 4, 7 and 10 degrees C) within the set shelf life and also indicates a potential public health risk if the pathogen would be present, thus indicating the inappropriateness of the setting of a 'best before' date. This highlights that more attention is needed to reflect, as an individual company or an industry association or competent authority on more stringent guidelines on the use and the validation of shelf life labels.

Our aim was to explore attitudes of urban Brazilian citizens about dairy production and, in particular, how they view four routine husbandry practices: early cow-calf separation; zero-grazing; culling of the newborn male calf; and dehorning without pain mitigation. Through in-depth interviews and a questionnaire using open-ended questions, we can conclude that animal welfare was a major issue for our participants, especially in terms of its perceived relation with milk quality. Although participants were initially unaware about any of the four management practices, they were all viewed as contentious and not supported. This study provides some insights that farmers and others working in the Brazilian dairy supply chain should take into consideration, particularly in terms of social sustainability. Abstract The primary aim of this study was to explore attitudes of urban Brazilian citizens about dairy production. A secondary aim was to determine their knowledge and attitudes about four potentially contentious routine dairy cattle management practices: early cow-calf separation; zero-grazing; culling of newborn male calves; and dehorning without pain mitigation. To address the first aim 40 participants were interviewed using open-ended semi-structured questions designed to probe their views and attitudes about dairy production in Brazil, and 300 participants answered a questionnaire that included an open-ended question about the welfare of dairy cattle. Primary concerns reported by the participants centered on milk quality, which included the rejection of any chemical additives, but also animal welfare, environmental and social issues. The interviewees rarely mentioned animal welfare directly but, when probed, expressed several concerns related to this topic. In particular, participants commented on factors that they perceived to influence milk quality, such as good animal health, feeding, clean facilities, and the need to avoid or reduce the use of drugs, hormones and pesticides, the avoidance of pain, frustration and suffering, and the ability of the animals to perform natural behaviors. To address our second aim, participants were asked questions about the four routine management practices. Although they self-reported being largely unaware of these practices, the majority of the participants rejected these practices outright. These data provide insight that animal welfare may be an important issue for members of the public. Failure to consider this information may increase the risk that certain dairy production practices may not be socially sustainable once lay citizens become aware of them.

J	Weijermars, R				Weijermars, R.			Natural Resource Wealth Optimization: A Review of Fiscal Regimes and Equitable Agreements for Petroleum and Mineral Extraction Projects	NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						Fiscal regimes; Oil and gas extraction projects; Mining projects; Equitable agreements	OIL; CONTRACTS	This review highlights the challenges of fiscal system optimization considering both the host government and extraction company perspectives. Countries around the world face an arduous task in determining the optimal fiscal system to maximize the capture of economic rents of natural resource extraction activities. The extraction industry is equally challenged to meet global commodity demand because the capital investments required for developing new hydrocarbon fields and ore mines are on the rise, while tax takes on extraction activities tend to rise too in many frontier jurisdictions. Normal profit must remain for the extraction companies, and returns must be large enough to replace for resource depletion. Companies use the benefits of resources produced in one country to finance capital investments for future field development in another country. One viewpoint is that profits are expatriated to the detriment of the host country and to the benefit of another country or the world supply chain as a whole. Another viewpoint is that all resource holders benefit because a foreign entity always starts in a new resource holding nation by investing in the development of an oil field or solid mineral mine using the profits from previous projects in other countries. A key question is What is a fair taxation regime for natural resource extraction in a particular geological setting and a given geographical location, taking into account subsurface uncertainty about the quality and volume of the resource, infrastructure needs and proximity to the world's major markets and trade centers? Tax distortion could go both ways: either incentivize, attract and stimulate or des-incentivize, repel and deter resource development. Additional factors to consider are external uncertainties such as political and fiscal stability, sovereign risk and even local weather conditions mostly in offshore and Arctic petroleum operations). Governments must tax the upstream rents of petroleum and mineral resources, but not to the level that suppresses extraction activities. All stakeholders want at least an equitable share of the profits. Defining what is equitable is a matter of intensive negotiations, renegotiation of prior agreements and sometimes litigation and international arbitration. Several case studies, covering both petroleum and solid mineral extraction projects, are included to highlight the key points involved in fiscal policies designed to optimize the utility of geological resource endowments. For example, the offshore tax regime employed in the US pivots the trade-offs between fiscal incentives and long-term resource supply to ensure energy security. This review concludes with a call for further research.

Some Aspects of Chicken Behavior and Welfare	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						Enriched environment; precision poultry production; consumer market; productivity	FEATHER PECKING BEHAVIOR; LAYING HENS; PRELAYING BEHAVIOR; ANIMAL-WELFARE; ENVIRONMENT; LITTER; LAYERS	Brazil is the world leader in broiler production and export. It achieved this position mainly to its excellent supply chain structure and climate, which favor poultry and grain production throughout its territory. Although Brazilian egg production is not as important as broiler production, this segment presents great potential of increasing its share in the global market. However, as elsewhere in the world, Brazilian poultry production faces the challenge to balance two elements within its supply chain: cruelty and productivity. The consumers of the European Union (EU) are very concerned with animal welfare issues. In order to increase its share in the European market, and eventually in the world market, Brazilian poultry producers must understand the effects of production systems on poultry welfare, and try to develop systems that are suited for its climate and other production conditions. There is a consensus that the natural behaviors performed by poultry in intensive production systems allow better welfare. This objective of this review is to present scientific research studies that relate different behaviors to chicken welfare. Poultry behavior is a reflex of their welfare status at a particular moment, and it is related to internal (physiological) and external (environmental) factors. Several natural behaviors that favor welfare, as well as undesirable behaviors, may be stimulated by environmental enrichment. The correct interpretation of the behaviors expressed by poultry, including their frequency, duration, and sequence, may be used to estimate their welfare. Animal production is an import sector of Brazilian economy. It significantly contributes to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), in terms of products destined both to domestic consumption and exports. New technologies applied to products and management practices have been developed for field application, aiming at improving producers' productivity and profitability. In order to comply with the European Union's (EU) guidelines for animal protein production, Brazilian poultry production needs to undergo a process of adaptation. In May, 2007, the EU Commission established its new guidelines for animal welfare in poultry production, pressured by consumer demand. In the EU, there is a growing concern among consumers as to how poultry are reared and slaughtered. European consumers are in the fore front of the demand of high quality products produced with under better welfare conditions, and have spread this concern throughout the world. Beaumont et al. (2010) mentioned that European consumers frequently perceive that standard commercial poultry production has poor animal welfare practices. According to Naas et al. (2008), Brazilian poultry production today needs to find a balance between cruelty and productivity. In fact, ensuring animal welfare may provide better financial results, as it increases the producer's profit margins and allows maintaining Brazilian chicken export quotas to the EU. Franca (2008) noted that biological studies that define ethical limits and guidelines for poultry production foster the development of new production practices that may ensure good product quality and productivity without putting bird welfare at risk. Gonyou (1994) states that, when animal welfare started to be studied, the only behavioral factors considered were those related to feeding and reproduction. These first studies used as indicators of animal welfare reduced life expectancy, impaired growth, impaired reproduction, body damage, disease, immunosuppression, adrenal activity, behavior anomalies, and self-narcotization (Broom, 1991). However, current studies evaluate additional indicators, such as natural behaviors, behavioral needs, preferences, behavioral problems, emotional state, cognitive abilities, etc. In the field of ethology, the expression of natural behavior is a frequently used tool used to estimate the welfare of poultry destined to human consumption. According to Bracke & Hopster (2006), natural behavior can be defined as the behavior the animal normally presents when exposed to conditions similar to its natural habitat. Natural behaviors are pleasurable and promote biological functions that are meaningful to the animal's welfare. The definition of natural behavior, though, does not include the bird's behavior when sick, in flight or during aggression, since these are not considered pleasurable situations. Considering layer behavioral needs in the design of housing facilities optimize their welfare. Mishra et al. (2005) verified that ISA Brown layers spent, during 24 hours, around 97% of the time in the nest, feeding, walking, resting, or dust bathing, and that 57% of these behaviors did not depend on environmental enrichment. It was also observed that hens had preferred behavioral sequences, which included foraging and comfort behaviors, such as wing-stretching and preening. The present review aims at discussing, albeit not exhaustively, scientific research studies on the behavior of Gallusgallus domesticus and its relationship to welfare. The following behaviors are reviewed: feather pecking, scratching, dust bathing, nesting, locomotion activities, and aggressive behaviors. These behaviors are the most frequently observed in commercial broiler, broiler breeder, and layer farming, and therefore, monitoring their incidence may contribute to measure poultry welfare.

J	Mirabella, N; Castellani, V; Sala, S				Mirabella, Nadia; Castellani, Valentina; Sala, Serenella			Life cycle assessment of bio-based products: a disposable diaper case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Biopolymers; Diaper; LCA; PLA	FUTURE; ENERGY	In this study, a life cycle assessment of a bioplastic based diaper was performed. The product has several innovative elements, due to the implementation of eco-design principles, such as: (1) introduction of biopolymers (namely polylactic acid (PLA) and Mater-biA (R)), (2) relevant reduction of petrochemical plastics, and (3) minimization of energy consumptions and use of renewable energy in manufacturing. The aim of the study is to evaluate the environmental benefits gained through eco-innovation, while identifying further areas of improvement. The bio-based diaper has been evaluated using a "cradle-to-gate" analysis. The functional unit is one diaper, assuming an average size among the different commercial options. A case study of an enterprise in Italy (WIP S.p.A) was carried out to collect as much reliable primary data as possible. In order to highlight potential areas of improvement and to compare the environmental performance of the product, a sensitivity analysis based on three different impact assessment methods (adopting ReCiPe 2008, IMPACT 2002+ and Cumulative Energy Demand (CED)) and a comparison with a standard commercial diaper were performed. Finally, three possible end-of-life scenarios including composting of WIP diaper were hypothesized and tested. Contribution analysis suggested that sourcing and production of raw materials used in WIP diaper manufacturing contributed most significantly to the potential environmental impacts. Adopting ReCiPe method, pulp, and sodium polyacrylate present the highest environmental burdens in WIP diaper system. Applying IMPACT2002+ method, PLA relative contribution to the toxicity increases, due to the generation of the electricity used in corn production and in PLA production phases. For both methods, impacts related to energy consumption of the WIP diapers' production process look to be negligible. WIP diaper performance has room for improvement, since critical points were detected in the life cycle stages of raw materials used. However, the results of the normalization step, according to ReCiPe method, state that WIP diapers can bring environmental benefits, compared to standard ones. Moreover, if composting end-of-life scenario is included in the assessment, there is a significant improvement in WIP diaper environmental performance compared to a standard diaper. Integrating eco-innovation and eco-design principles in the production of the bio-based diaper leads to a better environmental profile, compared to the standard one. Nevertheless, there are several areas of concerns to be considered in order to further improve its environmental performance. So far, the possible improvements identified from the case study are: (1) the selection of biopolymers suppliers with better production systems from an environmental point of view, (2) the reduction of distances along the supply chain, and (3) the implementation of composting procedures for the end of life. In conclusion, the introduction of biopolymers in diaper composition could lead them to be preferable compared to standard diapers, but criticisms arise, which need to be solved, to avoid the risk of burdens shifting.

J	Huang, HC; Tung, PS				Huang, Han Ching; Tung, Pei-Shan			The effects of liquidity trading on insider trade timing when an underlying option is present	MANAGERIAL FINANCE			English	Article						Liquidity trading; Insider trading; Scheduled corporate announcements; Underlying option	PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION; MARKET; STOCK; SECURITIES; RETURNS; VOLUME; FIRM	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the underlying option impacts an insider's propensity to purchase and sell before corporate announcements, the proportion of insiders' trading after announcements relative to before announcements, and the insider's profitability around corporate announcements. Design/methodology/approach The authors test whether the timing information and option have impacted on the tendency of insider trade, the percentage of all shares traded by insiders in the post-announcement to pre-announcement periods and the average cumulative abnormal stock returns during the pre-announcement period. Findings Insiders' propensity to trade before announcements is higher for stocks without options listed than for stocks with traded options. This result is stronger for unscheduled announcements than for scheduled ones. The proportion of insiders' trade volume after announcements relative to before announcements in stocks that have not options listed is higher than those in stocks with traded options. The positive relationship between the insiders' signed volume and the informational content of corporate announcements is stronger in stocks without traded options than in stocks with options listed. Insider trades prior to unscheduled announcement are more profitable than those before scheduled ones. Research limitations/implications The paper examines whether there is a difference between the effects of optioned stock and non-optioned stock. Roll et al. (2010) use the relative trading volume of options to stock ratio (O/S) to proxy for informed options trading activity. Future research could explore the impact of O/S. Moreover, the authors examine how insiders with private information use such information to trade in their own firms. Mehta et al. (2017) argue that insiders also use private information to facilitate trading (shadow trading) in linked firms, such as supply chain partners or competitors. Therefore, future research could consider the impact of shadow trading. Social implications Since the insider's propensity to buy before announcements in stocks without options listed is larger than in stocks with traded options and the relationship is stronger for unscheduled announcements than for scheduled ones, the efforts of regulators should focus on monitoring insider trading in stocks without options listed prior to unscheduled announcements. Originality/value First, Lei and Wang (2014) find that the increasing pattern of insider's propensity to trade before unscheduled announcements is larger than that before scheduled announcements. The authors document the underlying option has impacted the insider's propensity to purchase and sell, and the relationship is stronger for unscheduled announcements than for scheduled ones. Second, related studies show insider's trading activity has shifted from periods before corporate announcements to periods after corporate announcements to decrease litigation risk. This paper find the underlying option has influenced the proportion of insiders' trading after announcements relative to before announcements when the illegal insider trade-related penalties increase.

Delays in extraction and refining of these resources would adversely affect industrial players, including that of the host countries. Supplier selection is one of the most important decisions taken by managers of this industry that affect their supply chain operations. However, determining suitable suppliers to work with has become a phenomenon faced by these managers and their organizations. Furthermore, identifying relevant, critical and important criteria needed to guide these managers and their organizations for supplier selection decisions has become even more complicated due to various criteria that need to be taken into consideration. With limited works in the current literature of supplier selection in the oil and gas industry having major methodological drawbacks, the purpose of this paper is to develop an integrated approach for supplier selection in the oil and gas industry. Design/methodology/approach To address this problem, this paper proposes a new uncertain decision framework. A grey-Delphi approach is first applied to aid in the evaluation and refinement of these various available criteria to obtain the most important and relevant criteria for the oil and gas industry. The grey systems theoretic concept is adopted to address the subjectivity and uncertainty in human judgments. The grey-Shannon entropy approach is used to determine the criteria weights, and finally, the grey-EDAS (evaluation based on distance from average solution) method is utilized for determining the ranking of the suppliers. Findings To exemplify the applicability and robustness of the proposed approach, this study uses the oil and gas industry of Iran as a case in point. From the literature review, 21 criteria were established and using the grey-Delphi approach, 16 were finally considered. The four top-ranked criteria, using grey-Shannon entropy, include warranty level and experience time, relationship closeness, supplier's technical level and risks which are considered as the most critical and influential criteria for supplier evaluation in the Iranian oil and gas industry. The ranking of the suppliers is obtained, and the best and worst suppliers are also identified. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the results using the proposed methodology are robust. Originality/value This study is among the first few studies of supplier selection in the oil and gas industry from an emerging economy perspective and sets the stage for future research. The proposed integrated grey-based MCDM approach provides robust results in supplier evaluation and can be used for future domain applications.

Greenhouse gas emissions from pastoral based dairying systems: The effect of uncertainty and management change under two contrasting production systems	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE			English	Article						greenhouse gasses; systems; management strategies; pastoral dairy production; uncertainty	MILK-PRODUCTION; QUANTIFY; FLUXES	A previously developed model, the Pastoral Milk Emission Model (PME Model) was used to simulate both on-farm and off-farm greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (consisting of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (COD) under two contrasting pastoral based milk production systems. There were two primary objectives to this study. Firstly within the production systems studied, to identify the effect simple management changes may have on GHG emissions and farm profitability so that financially viable whole farm GHG mitigation strategies could be developed. The potential effect these management changes could have on national GHG emissions was quantified. The second objective was to determine what effect the characteristics of the production system may have on the uncertainty surrounding the emission of GHGs. The two contrasting production systems were the standard production procedures recommended for Kilinaley, (County Clare, Ireland) and Moorepark (County Cork, Ireland), with grazing seasons of 149 and 250 days per year respectively. The management scenarios tested were changes in pasture quality, pasture utilisation, N application rates, silage quality, level of concentrate supplementation and calving date. Stochastic budgeting revealed that emissions of GHGs were greater at Kilmaley than Moorepark whatever the level of risk/uncertainty. Simple fanning system changes, regardless of location, generally resulted in small changes in both on-farm and total GHG emissions (between-5.8 and +5.1%). However silage quality demonstrated a site specific interaction. Tailor designed whole farm GHG mitigation strategies were developed by combining all identified management changes, which simultaneously reduced GHG emissions and increased farm profitability. Relative to the standard production systems at Moorepark and Kilmaley, on-farm and total GHG emissions were 6.65% and 8.42% and 11.40% and 11.64% respectively. Farm profitability increased at both sites. Projecting these potential reductions onto the national dairy herd revealed that significant reductions in GHG emissions are possible. Relative to 2005 national emissions the implementation of the standard systems would achieve a reduction of 3.46%, this would increase to 4.04% for the tailor designed strategies. Additional reductions in GHG emissions would be achieved through a lowering of inputs within the farm supply chain. Sensitivity analysis revealed differences between systems with regards to source strength, however regardless of the system, source strength was always greatest for enteric CH4, confirmation that considerable efforts should be made to control this GHG source. However differences do exist between systems which suggests that national mitigation strategies must consider regional production systems if GHG reductions are to be maximised. This work has also highlighted the need for more data on indirect GHG emissions derived from leached N. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Lovett, D. K.; O'Mara, F.

J	Park, KM				Park, Kathleen Marshall			Navigating the digital revolution and crisis times: humanitarian and innovation-inspired leadership through the pandemic	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Leadership; COVID-19; Pandemic; Logistics; Innovation; Digital revolution; Digital supply chains; Digital disruptions; Humanitarian partnerships; Agility; GCC; MENA; Middle East	LIABILITY; FOREIGNNESS; PROGRAM	Purpose This article examines the leadership vision, values and vigilance of an emerging markets logistics firm in managing customer and humanitarian concerns and critical supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study explores how an emerging markets firm has contributed to global supply chain mobility and vaccine distribution in the pandemic - keeping cargo moving - drawing on vision, values and vigilance, including attention to the innovation momentum of the firm. Design/methodology/approach The article concentrates on an exemplar firm, leader and management team to illustrate challenges of helmsmanship during the pandemic for an emerging markets firm, Agility, that operates worldwide in numerous developed and developing economy markets. The article develops a case study analyzing how Agility has met the simultaneous challenges for innovation and transformation in the digital revolution and navigation through the crisis times of the global pandemic. The analysis derives from direct management communications, corporate documents and media sources. Findings The vision, values and vigilance of the leadership, with emphasis on digital innovations and disruptions, digital supply chains, humanitarian partnerships, focusing both globally and on emerging markets, and nurturing smaller as well as larger businesses, have enabled the firm to thrive. Given the importance of global supply chains during COVID-19, Agility is a pivotal example of partnering with governments and pharmaceutical companies worldwide in delivering the new array of vaccines, as well as personal protective equipment and other medical supplies, in the battle against the pandemic. Agility in addition illustrates the strategic value of partnering with other logistics firms in humanitarian collaborations as well as in business strategy transactions. Research limitations/implications The article contributes to the emergent research stream on leadership, innovation and internationalization in the Arabian Gulf Cooperation Council and Middle East North Africa (GCC/MENA) region and more generally on the strengths and proficiencies of emerging market firms and leaders. Future research could examine additional firms, industries or regions of the world during the pandemic or other crisis contexts.

J	Ahmadi, R; Yang, BR				Ahmadi, R; Yang, BR			Parallel imports: Challenges from unauthorized distribution channels	MARKETING SCIENCE			English	Article						international marketing; parallel imports; pricing; intrabrand competition; channel conflict; stackelberg game	INTERNATIONAL PRICE-DISCRIMINATION; GRAY MARKET	We examine the problem of parallel imports: unauthorized flows of products across countries, which compete with authorized distribution channels. The traditional economics model of a discriminating monopolist that has different prices for the same good in different markets requires the markets to be separated in some way, usually geographically. The profits from price discrimination can be threatened by parallel imports that allow consumers in the high-priced region some access to the low-priced marketplace. However, as this article shows, there is a very real possibility that parallel imports may actually increase profits. The basic intuition is that parallel importation becomes another channel for the authentic goods and creates a new product version that allows the manufacturer to price discriminate. We propose a two-country, three-stage model to quantitatively study the effects and strategies. In the third stage, and in the higher priced country where parallel imports have entered, we characterize the resulting market seg mentation. One segment of consumers stays with the authorized version as they place more value on the warranty and services that come with the authorized version. Another segment switches to parallel imports because a lower price is offered due to lack of country-specific features or warranties. Parallel imports also generate a third and new segment that would not have bought this product before. Unlike counterfeits that are fabricated by imitators, all parallel imports are genuine and sourced from the manufacturer in the lower-priced country through authorized dealers. Therefore, the manufacturer's global sales quantity should increase, but profit may rise or fall depending on the relative sizes and profitability of the segments. A profit-maximizing parallel importer should set price and quantity in the second stage after observing the manufacturer's prices in both countries. There will be a threshold of across-country price gap above which parallel imports would occur. In the first stage, the manufacturer can anticipate the possible occurrence of a parallel import, its price and quantity, and its effect on authorized sales in each country to make a coordinated pricing decision to maximize the global supply chain profit. Under some circumstances the manufacturer should allow parallel imports and under others should prevent them. Through a Stackelberg game we solve for the optimal pricing strategy in each scenario. We then find in one extension that when the number of parallel importers increases, the optimal authorized price gap should narrow, but the prices and quantities of parallel imports may rise or fall. In another extension, we find that when the manufacturer has other means-such as monitoring dealers, differentiating designs, and unbundling warranties-to contain parallel imports, the authorized price gap can widen as a function of the effectiveness of non-pricing controls. In summary, parallel imports may help the manufacturer to extend the global reach of its product and even boost its global profit. If the manufacturer offers a discount version through its authorized dealers, it is running a high risk of confusing customers and tarnishing brand images. Parallel imports may cause similar concerns for the manufacturer, but unauthorized dealers are perceived as further removed from the manufacturer. Therefore, there is less risk of confusing consumers when parallel imports are channeled through unauthorized dealers. Furthermore, they are more nimble in diverting the product whenever their transshipment and marketing costs are small enough not to offset the authorized price gap and the valuation discount. This may explain why some manufacturers fiercely fight parallel imports, while others knowingly use this alternative channel.

J	Lau, H; Nakandala, D; Shum, PK				Lau, Henry; Nakandala, Dilupa; Shum, Paul Kwok			A business process decision model for fresh-food supplier evaluation	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						TOPSIS; Fuzzy AHP; Supplier selection; ELECTRE; Business process decision model; Fresh food safety	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; SAFETY MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS; FUZZY AHP; VENDOR SELECTION; PRODUCE CHAIN; TRACEABILITY; CHALLENGES; QUALITY; ENVIRONMENT; STANDARDS	Purpose - Frequent food safety incidents caused widespread consumer concerns. Even though food safety is one of the weakest links in the fresh food supply chain and influences consumer food choice in ways different from the quality dimension, this factor is hardly proposed as one of the key traditional supplier selection criteria (e.g. quality, delivery, and price) in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to develop a business process decision model to assess the non-compensating food safety sub-criteria in order to disqualify fresh food suppliers that cannot reach the minimum threshold for low probable food safety failure. The preferred fresh food suppliers can minimize the risk of food safety failure and the associated huge food safety failure costs spanning from private consumer anguish to social distress that cause unbearable costs of sales loss and damage to brand image in business. Design/methodology/approach - This study proposes a novel approach that combines several well-established multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques, including fuzzy AHP (FAHP), TOPSIS, and ELECTRE, and innovatively apply to analyze supplier performance and prioritize potential fresh food suppliers. This hybrid business process model can enforce compliance to all the five non-compensatory sub-criteria of food safety. Since ELECTRE is a non-compensatory MCDM method, it is therefore particularly applicable for disqualifying high risk fresh food suppliers from further full scale supplier performance evaluation by FAHP and TOPSIS. This hybrid business process decision model is able to capitalize on the strengths of these MCDM methods and offset their deficiencies. Findings - This study uses data of an international supermarket chain to validate feasibility of the proposed model. Results indicate that this model is able to assess the non-compensating food safety sub-criteria via the ELECTRE method in order to disqualify fresh food suppliers that cannot reach the minimum threshold for low probable food safety failure. Only the preferred suppliers with the required food safety capability can proceed to the second stage of the supplier selection process. Assessment via the TOPSIS method reveals the ranking order of those top performing suppliers according to their relative scores along all the supplier selection criteria. The TOPSIS ranking results with the selection of the suppliers C, E, A, and F are robust and consistent across all the different scenarios. Practical implications - Application to the fresh food industry is possible with the aid of the MCDM methods. The contribution to the body of knowledge in this teaching and research field demonstrates the importance of first identifying the order qualifier for disqualifying those suppliers that do not satisfy the food safety requirements via the ELECTRE method. The proposed assessment procedure complies with the regulatory policy on food safety, and would influence public policy in applying the best practice of food safety regulation. Without first qualifying the potential suppliers on the basis of food safety, wrong decision can be made to select those high food risk suppliers that have relatively higher overall scores in other supplier selection criteria. Using the assessment results has positive economic and commercial impact on the purchasing managers to formulate appropriate purchasing and supplier development strategy to enhance supplier's food safety performance, whilst maximizing the overall supplier portfolio performance. The improved supplier's food safety performance will certainly benefit the society's quality of life as well. Originality/value - Based on the analytical MCDM methods of FAHP, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE, purchasing managers can operationalize the Hill's framework of order qualifier and winner that has primarily been used in the literature and manufacturing industry. This study represents the first move to innovatively apply the FAHP, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE methods to operationalize the Hill's framework of order qualifier and winner that has primarily been used in the literature and manufacturing industry. Application to the fresh food industry to validate the feasibility of the proposed model has been conceived and implemented in this study. Analysis of the data inputs of a supermarket chain via the three MCDM methods generate the results that fulfill the purpose of achieving the research objective of identifying and managing the supplier base that can deliver the best supplier performance, conditional on first passing the fresh food safety test.

J	Uppari, BS; Hasija, S				Uppari, Bhavani Shanker; Hasija, Sameer			Modeling Newsvendor Behavior: A Prospect Theory Approach	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						newsvendor problem; prospect theory; reference point; pull-to-center effect; model selection	LOSS AVERSION; REFERENCE POINTS; DISAPPOINTMENT; DECISION; RISK; PROBABILITY; SALIENCE; CHOICE; LEVEL; BIAS	Problem definition: Studies have shown that the behavior of subjects in newsvendor experiments is not consistent with expected profit maximization-an assumption that is often made in operations management literature. Although prospect theory has been established as a popular model of behavioral decision making under uncertainty, it was considered to be inconsistent with observed newsvendor behavior (in particular, the pull-to-center effect) until a recent study by Long and Nasiry [Long X, Nasiry J (2015) Prospect theory explains newsvendor behavior: The role of reference points. Management Sci. 61(12): 3009-3012.] proposed a prospect theory model that is consistent with the pull-to-center effect; however, this model's ability in representing newsvendor behavior compared to other plausible prospect theory models is unexplored in the literature. This paper takes a more comprehensive approach in building several prospect theory-based newsvendor models and evaluates their competence in representing the observed newsvendor behavior. An important feature of these models is that they are not only consistent with the pull-to-center effect, but they can also, in accordance with the findings from recent research, accommodate individual-level heterogeneity in order quantities. Academic/practical relevance: Designing effective supply chain processes and inventory systems requires that the underlying models represent the observed newsvendor behavior reasonably well, especially in settings where most decisions are made by individuals. Our paper provides a rigorous basis for choosing a model when characterizing the decision making process of a newsvendor. Moreover, our novel approach to model building and testing could serve as a template for selecting appropriate prospect theory models in contexts other than the newsvendor problem. Methodology: Motivated by different types of reference points studied in the decision theory literature, we first build several newsvendor models that can theoretically accommodate individual-level heterogeneity in order quantities. Thereafter, using a multipronged approach based on theoretical criteria, goodness of fit, and empirical validity, we evaluate these models to determine the most appropriate model. Results: The model with mean demand as the stochastic reference point consistently outperforms other models, reducing the prediction error by as much as 31% on the experimental data used for this study. Moreover, all the empirical regularities considered in our paper are consistent only with this model. This suggests that mean demand is more likely to be adopted by experimental subjects as a reference point-perhaps because of its greater salience than the other plausible reference points considered. Managerial implications: Since decisions are made predominantly by human retailers in the emerging markets, we represent their behavior by the model with mean demand as the reference point and identify settings in which they could benefit from investing in decision support systems. We also demonstrate the benefits to a supplier from approximating his retailers' behavior with this model relative to him using the other prospect theory models considered in this paper.

WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRAFFICKING A reflection on the first 20 years of the modern anti-slavery fight	ROUTLEDGE INTERNATIONAL HANDBOOK OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING: A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY AND APPLIED APPROACH	Routledge International Handbooks		English	Article; Book Chapter						human trafficking; slavery; involuntary servitude, peonage; "The 3Ps"; Civil Rights Division, the Mann Act; worker-led social responsibility; supply chains	SEX TRAFFICKING; STATES; LENS	Almost 20 years since the enactment of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act and promulgation of the United Nations Trafficking Protocol, modern anti-trafficking efforts and U.S. leadership in the global effort to combat modern slavery must be understood in the context of American enforcement efforts dating back to Reconstruction under the labels of peonage, involuntary servitude, and slavery, and now human trafficking. The modern anti-trafficking frame of the 3Ps of prevention, protection, and prosecution was rooted in civil rights and human rights concepts of slavery and freedom rather than concepts of commerce, migration, or regulation of prostitution. That new approach, however, has been limited by unresolved cultural and legal legacies of a competing anti-trafficking framework based on commerce and morality - the "White Slave Trafficking" effort of the early 1900s. At its best, the 3P framework of the modern U.S. and UN instruments and policies drives best practices in critical reporting and implementation standards, criminal and civil enforcement, victim identification, supply chain transparency, and worker-led social responsibility while capturing and incorporating the voices and lived experiences of survivors. Continued implementation of this modern rights-based approach is at risk, however, given the rhetorical and cultural strength of the competing sex trafficking lens.(3) Learning Objectives At the end of the chapter, readers will be able to: 1 Understand the development of the issue area currently defined as "human trafficking"; 2 Identify the historical uses of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which ended chattel slavery and prohibited subsequent forms of slavery and involuntary servitude but was limited in its efficacy by systemic evasion and lack of resources; 3 Understand how contradictory legal regimes added to confusion in the anti-trafficking space in the twentieth century and left some victims of compelled service unprotected by the law, most notably through the dominance of the "White Slave Trafficking Act" approach in the sex trafficking arena; 4 Identify the conceptual and historical underpinnings of both rights-based anti-trafficking efforts and commerce or morality-based anti-trafficking efforts, as well as the policy approaches that flow from each; 5 Understand the modern history of the U.S. government's involuntary servitude and slavery program and how it became cast as "human trafficking" in the 1990s; 6 Examine how different presidential administrations have approached modern slavery since the promulgation of the United Nations protocol and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, both in rhetorical approaches and policy/enforcement actions; 7 Interrogate how and to what extent the rhetoric and implementation of the modern slavery/ trafficking movement are correlated; and 8 Identify best practices that deliver on the "3P" paradigm, such as multidisciplinary task forces, victim identification and protection, and worker-led social responsibility (WSR) efforts.

Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are a threat to food safety because they may harbor multiple enterotoxins and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. CNS bacteria are an emerging nosocomial pathogen in public health. CNS also cause bovine mastitis with a significant economic loss in the dairy industry and may introduce toxins to the food supply chain resulting in foodborne illnesses. However, information on CNS and their AMR status are scarce in food animal production and processing lines in Ethiopia. Methodology: This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence and AMR patterns of CNS in dairy farms and abattoirs using samples (n =1001) from udder milk, beef carcass, personnel, and different abattoir and dairy equipment across five locations of central Oromia. The CNS isolates were identified via standard microbiological protocols and evaluated using disc diffusion test against 14 antimicrobials belonging to nine different broad classes. Uni-and-multivariable logistic regressions were used to analyze the association between potential risk factors (location, sample source, and sample type) and positivity to CNS. Results: The overall prevalence of CNS in the five different geographic locations studied was 9.6% (range: 6.7-12.4%) and varied between abattoirs (11.3%) and dairy farms (8.0%). CNS were prevalent on the carcass, milk, equipment, personnel hands, and nasal samples. Of all CNS isolates, 7.1, 10.7, 7.1, 12.5, 17.9, 10.7, 12.5, 7.1, 1.8, 5.4, 1.8, and 5.4% exhibited AMR simultaneously to single, double, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 antimicrobials, respectively. Overall, the isolates displayed 51 different AMR phenotypic patterns in which 50% of the isolates exhibited quadruple-resistance simultaneously based on the nine broad antimicrobial classes tested using 14 representative antimicrobials. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) CNS (i.e. >= 3 classes of antimicrobials) was significantly (p =0.037) different between locations with 100, 57.1, 50, 86.7, and 76.9% in Addis Ababa, Adama, Assela, Bishoftu, and Holeta, respectively. However, the prevalence of MDR CNS was not significantly (p =0.20) different between dairy farms (87.5%) and abattoirs (71.9%). We evaluated the effect of acquiring cefoxitin-resistance of the isolates on the efficacy (i.e. inhibition zone) of the rest antimicrobials using General Linear Model after adjusting geographical locations as a random effect. Isolates with cefoxitin-resistance significantly displayed resistance to eight antimicrobials of 14 tested including amoxicillin, penicillin, cloxacillin, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, and tetracycline (p =0.000), and erythromycin (p =0.02). On the other hand, cefoxitin-resistant isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, streptomycin, and sulphamethoxazone trimethoprim (p =0.000). Thus, antimicrobials such as gentamicin and ciprofloxacin may be an alternative therapy to treat cefoxitin-resistant CNS, as 96.4% of CNS isolates were susceptible to these antimicrobials. Overall, 94.1 and 54.5% of the CNS isolates among cefoxitin-resistant and cefoxitinsusceptible, respectively, harbored resistance to 3 or more classes of antimicrobials i.e. MDR. Conclusion: The overall prevalence of CNS in milk, meat, equipment, and food handlers in central Oromia was 9.6% but varied by location and sample source. Some specific niches such as equipment, hands, and nasal cavities of personnel are significant sites for the source of CNS. Most, but not all, MDR CNS isolates were cefoxitinresistant. Overall, 78.6% of the CNS tested were MDR and 50% had resistance to four or more broad classes of antimicrobials. CNS in food animals (raw milk and meat), equipment, and food handlers can be the source of MDR to the public. Personnel safety and hygienic food handling practices are needed. In addition, further investigation into the risk factors for the transmission and mechanisms of resistance of the CNS is required for intervention.

J	Asl, MG; Rashidi, MM; Abad, SAHE				Asl, Mahdi Ghaemi; Rashidi, Muhammad Mahdi; Abad, Seyed Ali Hosseini Ebrahim			Emerging digital economy companies and leading cryptocurrencies: insights from blockchain-based technology companies	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Emerging digital economy companies; Cryptocurrencies; Bayesian asymmetric DCC-MGARCH; Markov chain Monte Carlo	AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL HETEROSCEDASTICITY; SUPPLY CHAIN; PRICE DISCOVERY; VOLATILITY SPILLOVERS; EXCHANGE-RATES; STOCK MARKETS; CLEAN ENERGY; OIL PRICES; CRUDE-OIL; BITCOIN	Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the price return of leading cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Monero, Stellar, Peercoin and Dash, and stock return of technology companies' indices that mainly operate on the blockchain platform and provide financial services, including alternative finance, democratized banking, future payments and digital communities. Design/methodology/approach This study employs a Bayesian asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) (BADCC-MGARCH) model with skewness and heavy tails on daily sample ranging from August 11, 2015, to February 10, 2020, to investigate the dynamic correlation between price return of several cryptocurrencies and stock return of the technology companies' indices that mainly operate on the blockchain platform. Data are collected from multiple sources. For parameter estimation and model comparison, the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is employed. Besides, based on the expected Akaike information criterion (EAIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), deviance information criterion (DIC) and weighted Deviance Information Criterion (wDIC), the skewed-multivariate Generalized Error Distribution (mvGED) is selected as an optimal distribution for errors. Finally, some other tests are carried out to check the robustness of the results. Findings The study results indicate that blockchain-based technology companies' indices' return and price return of cryptocurrencies are positively correlated for most of the sampling period. Besides, the return price of newly invented and more advanced cryptocurrencies with unique characteristics, including Monero, Ripple, Dash, Stellar and Peercoin, positively correlates with the return of stock indices of blockchain-based technology companies for more than 93% of sampling days. The results are also robust to various sensitivity analyses. Research limitations/implications The positive correlation between the price return of cryptocurrencies and the return of stock indices of blockchain-based technology companies can be due to the investors' sentiments toward blockchain technology as both cryptocurrencies and these companies are based on blockchain technology. It could also be due to the applicability of cryptocurrencies for these companies, as the price return of more advanced and capable cryptocurrencies with unique features has a positive correlation with the return of stock indices of blockchain-based technology companies for more days compared to the other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum, that may be regarded more as speculative assets. Practical implications The study results may show the positive role of cryptocurrencies in improving and developing technology companies that mainly operate on the blockchain platform and provide financial services and vice versa, suggesting that managers and regulators should pay more attention to the usefulness of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. This study also has important risk management and diversification implications for investors and companies investing in cryptocurrencies and these companies' stock. Besides, blockchain-based technology companies can add cryptocurrencies to their portfolio as hedgers or diversifiers based on their strategy. Originality/value This is the first study analyzing the connection between leading cryptocurrencies and technology companies that mainly operate on the blockchain platform and provide financial services by employing the Bayesian ssymmetric DCC-MGARCH model. The results also have important implications for investors, companies, regulators and researchers for future studies.

J	Mishra, O				Mishra, Oly			Principles of frugal innovation and its application by social entrepreneurs in times of adversity: an inductive single-case approach	JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN EMERGING ECONOMIES			English	Article						Crisis; Frugal; Innovation; Social entrepreneurs; Social entrepreneurship	OF-THE-ART; EMERGING MARKETS; PRODUCT INNOVATION; CRISIS MANAGEMENT; SPECIAL-ISSUE; ENTERPRISES; BUSINESS; BRICOLAGE; CREATION; VALIDATION	Purpose This study aims to focus on implementing frugal innovation and its principles by social entrepreneurs to face the challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research paper discusses the case of an Indian social entrepreneur who works for menstrual health and hygiene of unprivileged and rural women in India. The social entrepreneur's constant endeavor is to create an ecosystem to ensure rural women's economic and social upliftment through financial inclusion and livelihood training. When faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, the social entrepreneur re-purposed the manufacturing process to produce masks that were the need of the hour. Design/methodology/approach The research paper is qualitative and follows an inductive case study approach. The underlying principles of frugal innovation are established through content analysis of the social entrepreneur's interviews and her team members. Findings The study discusses how adversity can be an opportunity for social entrepreneurs by implementing frugal innovation principles, i.e. re-use, re-purpose, re-combine and rapidity, in times of crisis. Research limitations/implications One of the major limitations of this study is that it is based on a single case study, as, in the current scenario, this case appeared to be the most suitable one. There is no way to generalize the assumptions of this model. Researchers will have to study the phenomena of frugal innovation in adversity across multiple cases in the future. Also, the study is based on a single emerging economy, i.e. India. Further research may be carried out with such cases from other countries. Practical implications The proposition of this research paper will help new and established social entrepreneurs understand that the four principles of frugal innovation and their practical application by a social entrepreneur. This will act as a guiding light for the present and future entrepreneurs regarding how one can respond to a crisis. This will also help advance our understanding of the distinct ways in which social entrepreneurs' activities can help society in times of crisis. The findings of this research paper provide timely implications for social entrepreneurs. To respond efficiently to various crises, it is important to consider its effect on social entrepreneurship. Social implications The research paper shows that the social enterprise has implemented frugal innovation principles to manufacture the COVID-19 protection items supplied through existing supply chain networks. Also, a social entrepreneur is not intimidated by the sudden changes in the business environment; instead, they look at the situation as an opportunity to do something new. They are always willing to take the risk to innovate a solution that will address people's problems. frugal innovation, due to its highly collaborative nature and its ability to make the most from limited resources, is the only way social entrepreneurs can create an inclusive, secure and sustainable future. Originality/value There are several challenges in social entrepreneurship, especially in emerging economies like India. During the pandemic, availability of resources was the major challenge, due to which social entrepreneurs had to find solutions through frugal innovation. This paper provides the practical application of the four principles of frugal innovation implemented by a social enterprise to manufacture and supply Covid protection items. It also presents the practical and managerial implications of the principles of frugal innovation by social entrepreneurs in low resource settings.

J	Rumyantseva, TB				Rumyantseva, Tatiana B.			THE US GOVERNMENT POLICY AIMED AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL CAPACITY OF SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES (1980S-1990S)	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						United States; innovation policy; small and medium-sized enterprises		The United States is one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world. At the same time, during the period of not less than 50 years it has been experiencing strong competition from innovative economies of such countries as Japan and Germany. In order to reduce the USA's technological lag with Japan, the Republican government of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush started to pay special attention to the development of partnerships between government and small or medium-sized business, especially in the field of research and development (R&D). The Republicans were convinced that economic growth could be achieved by attraction of private capital for creation of partnerships based on the "government-industry" principle. Moreover, federal investments in technology were also necessary. In 1988, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was created. Its aim was to promote the economic growth of the United States through partnerships with industry in the sphere of development and application of new technologies and standards. The mission of NIST laboratories was to satisfy needs of the US industry in technological infrastructure, including standards, measuring technology, data evaluation, simulation of manufacturing processes, product testing and quality control technology. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 marked the beginning of two experimental programs carried out under the auspices of the National Institute of Standards and Technology: the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) and the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). The aim of the first program was to provide technical assistance and support in the field of management to small and medium-sized companies. MEP was launched in 1989 and was originally considered as a program for creation of manufacturing technology centers to provide services to small and medium-sized enterprises. The main task of the established regional centers was to improve the manufacturing and technological capacity of US small companies. Qualified MEP centers worked directly with small and medium manufacturing firms providing expertise, services and assistance directed to foster growth, improve supply chain positioning, leverage emerging technologies, upgrade manufacturing processes, develop work force training and apply and implement new information. Implementation of the MEP program had led to several important results. First, the regional manufacturing centers received a powerful incentive to find new partner organizations and provide services needed by small and medium-sized enterprises. Second, the enterprises-customers also had strong motivation because they invested their own funds in the manufacturing process modernization. Third, partial payment for services by the federal, regional or local government made services of regional centers more affordable to small and medium-sized enterprises. As a result, by the end of the 1990s, regional manufacturing centers had worked on more than 9 000 various projects with about 30 000 small and medium-sized enterprises. Another initiative aimed at reducing the USA's technological lag, was development of the Advanced Technology Program. It was designed to bridge the gap between the research lab and the marketplace, to enhance US competitiveness, as well as to create conditions under which the US economy could benefit from partnership-based federal investments in R&D. This program was aimed to share federal costs with industry in order to accelerate development and wide dissemination of new high-risk technologies that promised greater economic benefits for the country. The ATP funding was directed to technical research but not product development. Companies, either singly or jointly, conceived, proposed and executed all projects, often in collaboration with universities and federal laboratories. The ATP shared the cost for projects that were selected for a limited time. Single-company awardees could receive up to $2 million for R&D activities for up to three years. Larger companies had to contribute at least sixty percent of the total project cost. Joint ventures could receive funds for R&D activities for up to five years. Thus, developed in 1988 under the Reagan administration, first funded in 1990 under the Bush administration, and reached the large-scale development under the Clinton administration, the Advanced Technology Program represented one element of the U.S. government's efforts to restore and enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. economy. It provided cost-shared, competitive grants to industry to support R&D on high-risk, cutting-edge technologies with broad commercial potential and societal benefit.

Improvisation and Entrepreneurial Bricolage versus Rationalisation: A case-based analysis of contrasting responses to economic instability in the UK brass musical instruments industry	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article							ORGANIZATIONAL IMPROVISATION	In periods of economic crisis and instability, the response of many business organisations is to try and adapt to prevailing market conditions, This typically results in a pattern of retrenchment and rationalisation designed to cut costs. Responses of this kind may be justifiable and, to varying degrees, effective at a firm-level. However, their wider repercussions can include the worsening of a pre-existing economic downturn (e.g. large-scale redundancies affecting local communities and cancelled orders affecting other firms in the supply chain). When faced with an economic crisis, some firms adopt a more entrepreneurial approach, in which the key features are strategic reappraisal and various forms of product, process and organisational innovation (Filippetti and Archibugi, 201 1). While large corporations are capable of this kind of trans-formation, there is an Increasing recognition of the important part that smaller entrepreneurial firms can play In innovation (Christensen. 1997) including the reinvigoration of industry sectors through open innovation (Chesbrough, 2003) and contributing to the reconfiguration of geographic clusters (Best, 2001). Studios of long wave cycles have shown that periods of economic crisis and depression can be Important for innovation: they can disrupt established industry structures and cause entrepreneurs to see markets and customers in a different light so that they re-think products and services (Barras, 2009). However, comparatively little attention has been directed to considering just how entrepreneurial individuals in smaller firms mobilise the resources necessary for innovation and cope with risk in the unfavourable and demanding conditions that prevail in times of economic crisis. This exploratory study seeks to address this research gap. It does so through an in-depth historical case study of the contrasting responses of two firms, in the same industry sector but operating on different scales with differing modes of production (i.e, a rtisanal v. mechanised). to the greatest economic crisis of the 20th century, namely. the Great Depression of the I 930s (Crafts and Fearon, 201 I ). The two firms, which served the same markets and were affected by the same external forces, followed very different paths: the larger one engaged in a series of acquisitions as a means of rationalising production and cutting Costs, while the much smaller firm that operated on a very modest scale chose to Innovate. This Innovation involved developing a product that was new to Britain at the time. namely the sousaphone, an unorthodox musical instrument that hitherto had only been produced in the United States. As well as comparing the activities of die two firms operating on different scales. the study examines why the owners of this small firm decided to Innovate In the very difficult trading conditions that prevailed at the time, and exactly how they were able to acquire and mobilise the resources needed to pursue this path. In particular, the study focuses on the use of improvisation (Karnoche. Cunha and Cunha. 2002), that is to say 'impromptu action (Dickson. 1997: p. 37). and the closely related concept of entrepreneurial 'bricolago' (Baker and Nelson, 2005; Phillips and Tracey. 2007) or 'making do' (Eisenberg, 1990; p. 154). as a means of accessing the resources required. The findings suggest that while large-scale enterprises often concluded that a strategy of retrenchment and raclonalisadon was the appropriate response to economic crisis, firms operating on a smaller scale viewed the situation differently and responded to the altered trading conditions in more positive. creative and entrepreneurial ways. As a result they were able to identify opportunities associated with new and expanding markets. with scope for innovation. The study provides insights Into the ways in which these small firms were able to identify and access the necessary resources for their innovations. It also sheds new light on the improvisatory nature of their entrepreneurial response, and incapacity to overcome seemingly Insurmountable obstacles to growth in a recessionary environment (e.g. adapting existing resources to new uses, forming unconventional subcontracting arrangements and turning existing skills to new uses). The paper concludes with a summary of the key findings and their implications for future research and practice.

J	Charlebois, S; Creedy, A; von Massow, M				Charlebois, Sylvain; Creedy, Amy; von Massow, Mike			"Back of house" - focused study on food waste in fine dining: the case of Delish restaurants	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURE TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY RESEARCH			English	Article						Sustainability; Inventory management; Food waste; Casual dining; Kitchen practices; Food procurement	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; SAFETY; PERFORMANCE; PERCEPTIONS; BARRIERS; INDUSTRY; QUALITY; KITCHEN; SYSTEMS; HOTELS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the key determinants of back-of-house-based food waste in food service outlets. This case study focuses on Delish restaurants, a well-known restaurant chain in Canada, and aims to provide a clear understanding of food service procurement, kitchen practices, cost management, risk mitigation, menu design and technical literacy needs in hospitality. Some recommendations for future studies are also provided. Design/methodology/approach - The authors chose an exploratory case study design to guide our investigation on restaurants and food waste, based on Yin's (1994) argument that case studies are the preferred strategy when the "why" questions is being posed and when the focus is on a modern occurrence within a real-life context. Such a design is particularly appropriate for understanding the details and complexity of a phenomenon and its design (Stake, 1995). In this study, research data were collected through multiple points. A semi-structured questionnaire was designed and adopted to collect primary data. The objective of the empirical segment is not to test the applicability of the existing approaches, but rather to study conceptual nuances related to the presented model. A survey study was focused on formal interviews onsite, in two different food service facilities (Restaurant A and B). Findings - When considering food procurement, supplier relationships were found to not be significant for food waste prevention. Company-wide agreements with specific suppliers prevented individual chefs from creating alterations in their ordering to prevent waste. Order shorting was a somewhat common occurrence. However, most employees did not identify portion size as a large driver of waste. This conclusion conflicts somewhat with studies in this area (Kantor et al., 1997). If there was waste on a plate, it is much more likely to be the starches, which are low-cost items as opposed to high-cost proteins. Research limitations/implications - This research has its limitations, which present opportunities for future research. First, this case study is based on two case studies which have their weaknesses, especially in the reliability of data collection. In future, even though both restaurants had access to an earlier version of this case, a more structured analysis with performance indicators related to food waste would contribute to the internal validity of the study. The external validity of the proposed back-of-house-based determinant framework would benefit from being empirically tested with a larger sample, as the author cannot imply that this study's findings are transferable to other food service operations. Practical implications - From a managerial perspective, this study has merit. Arguably, the restaurant industry has a cumulative impact on the environment, economy and society as a whole. As more consumers in the Western world eat away from home, proper food management practices are desirable. Currently, few governments regulate or mandate measures to monitor restaurants' sustainability claims and waste management. As consumer expectations change, the onus falls on food operations to validate and inform patrons on practices behind the scenes. Culinary kitchens are often not visible or accessible for some customers, or even obscure for others. Social implications - Strategies undertaken by management and chefs are reactive as opposed to proactive strategies. The reactive strategies are only able to identify waste a week after it has occurred through inventory checks. From this point, it may be impossible to identify the cause of the waste to prevent it from happening in the future. In addition, attribution to the cause may be laid on the incorrect individual, which will further exacerbate the social learning of the staff as a whole. Proactive strategies undertaken before waste occurs are more effective. Originality/value - It must be noted that most of the literature on food waste management in casual-dining restaurants does not cover the key challenges found in the food industry. Most noticeable in the review is that there are very few studies in the literature that include food waste management practices linked to distribution management. This area of interest within the hospitality industry has not been well-developed in recent years and requires more attention.
